The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments expecting long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing or selling investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. You might have different types of investments in each account based on their tax implications. For example, keep higher-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Financial Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Assess your financial goals and how far you are from retirement. If retirement is a long way off, you may choose to risk more in your investment accounts.

6. **Assess Fees and Investments:**
   - Check the fees associated with your 401(k) and other accounts. Opt for low-cost index funds or ETFs when possible.
