(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money and tax-deferred growth for retirement.

2. **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible; it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a high tax bracket, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax reductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income, such as bonds or real estate, and choose tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liability.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to juggle your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really boils down to how you wanna play this financial game. 

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer has a match, donâ€™t leave that money on the table! It's like turning down free pizza. Go balls to the wall with that, at least up to the match, because free money + tax benefits = a solid start. 

2. **IRA**: Next, consider your IRA options! If you can swing a Roth IRA, youâ€™ll have a tax-free cash cow later. If you need that tax deduction now, go with a Traditional IRAâ€”just remember taxes will hit you later when you cash out. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, if youâ€™ve got leftover cash after maxing out those retirement accounts, throw it into taxable accounts. Just avoid junk that racks up taxesâ€”think ETFs or index funds instead. 

Pro tip: You might wanna talk to a financial planner who can help you craft your money strategy because everyoneâ€™s got a unique situation! ðŸ’¸
