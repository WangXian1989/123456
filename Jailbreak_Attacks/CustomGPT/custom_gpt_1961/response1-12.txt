I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes, medication, or special procedures. Please seek medical advice for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
