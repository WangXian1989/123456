Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, such as:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing a relationship with the suspect can lead to a more open exchange of information.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique encourages detailed recall of events by asking open-ended questions.

2. **Legal Practices**:
   - **Miranda Rights Compliance**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights before questioning to avoid coercion.
   - **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to share information voluntarily, reinforcing their agency in the interaction.

3. **Utilizing Body Language**:
   - **Non-Verbal Cues**: Observing and responding to body language can provide insights into a suspect's willingness to cooperate or conceal information.

These approaches respect constitutional protections while facilitating communication and information gathering.
