Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. 
   - **Invest in growth**: Focus on long-term growth investments since this account is tax-advantaged.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. Great for reducing taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you might need access to before retirement.
   - Invest in assets with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Allocation Strategy**:
- Start with maximizing your 401(k) match.
- Then contribute to an IRA based on your tax situation.
- Finally, allocate funds to your taxable account for flexibility and short-term needs.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy.
