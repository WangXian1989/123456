To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if eligible, prioritizing Roth or Traditional IRAs based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Balance for Flexibility and Tax Efficiency:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement, keeping more liquid assets.
   - Allocate tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep higher-growth investments (that may generate significant capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure balance aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.
   - Reassess contributions annually based on income changes and investment performance.

Overall, the key is to leverage tax-advantaged accounts as much as possible while maintaining the necessary liquidity in taxable accounts.
