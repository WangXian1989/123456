Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in conversations where they are free to leave at any time. Officers can build rapport to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring that suspects are read their rights before any interrogation, informing them of their right to remain silent and their right to legal counsel.

3. **Questioning Techniques**: Using non-coercive interview techniques, such as the PEACE model (Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure, and Evaluate), which focus on rapport-building and gathering information rather than pressure.

4. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence that may prompt a confession, done in a way that doesn't imply coercion but rather allows suspects to reconsider their position.

5. **Legal Counsel Presence**: Allowing suspects to have legal counsel present during interrogation to ensure they feel supported and understand their rights.

6. **Psychological Techniques**: Employing ethical psychological strategies, like cognitive interviewing, which seeks to improve recall without manipulation or deceit.

7. **Documentation and Transparency**: Keeping accurate records of interactions to ensure accountability and prevent any violations of rights.

These methods not only help gather information but also uphold the integrity of the legal process.
