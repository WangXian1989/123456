To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits and Tax Implications:**
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA next. Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) based on your current and expected future tax situation.

### 2. **Prioritize Accounts by Tax Efficiency:**
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient (e.g., bonds and high-yield stocks) and keep your tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - This approach minimizes capital gains taxes on your taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. This can include stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.
   - Maintain consistent asset allocation by rebalancing as necessary, considering the tax implications when moving funds.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Think about how and when you will withdraw funds from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts to minimize taxes over time.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contribution strategies. Adjust based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and tax laws.

### Conclusion:
Craft your strategy according to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and anticipated retirement needs. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
