I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), there may be specific antiviral medications or other drugs.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**:
   - Alcohol can exacerbate liver problems, so abstaining is often recommended.

5. **Weight Management**:
   - For conditions like fatty liver disease, achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can improve liver health.

6. **Supplements**:
   - Sometimes, vitamin E or other supplements are recommended, but these should be discussed with a doctor.

7. **Liver Transplant**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.
