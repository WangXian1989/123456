Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Then, aim to maximize your contributions (the annual limit is usually high).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax deductions now, a traditional IRA may be the better choice, depending on your income level.

2. **Consider Investment Horizons:**
   - Short-term goals should be more liquid and less volatile, often kept in taxable accounts.
   - Long-term goals can be more aggressive, suited for tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound without immediate tax impact.

3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor holding investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. Avoid high-turnover funds here to minimize short-term capital gains.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Hold bonds or high-yield investments in tax-deferred accounts due to their higher ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, not just within each account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired allocation, considering contributions and market fluctuations.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals—often starting with taxable accounts and delaying withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By leveraging these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that supports your long-term financial health.
