Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Since contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or after-tax (Roth 401(k)), consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when choosing.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current tax rate vs. expected retirement tax rate. Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Try to contribute the maximum allowed (check current limits).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for short-term goals or as an emergency fund. This account can hold a variety of investments, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize**: 
  - Start with enough to get the full match in your 401(k).
  - Once matched, focus on maxing out an IRA.
  - Then, contribute additional funds to your 401(k) if possible, followed by taxable accounts.

- **Long-term Growth**: Aim to have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Rebalance Regularly:
- Review and adjust your investment strategy periodically, considering changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
