(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, try to max out contributions to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now but taxes withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might want to access before retirement or for assets that generate lower capital gains and dividends. This can also serve as a buffer for emergencies or short-term needs.

The key is to balance tax efficiency with liquidity needs and your investment goals. Regularly reviewing your asset allocation can also help optimize your investment strategy over time.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: First up, slap down enough dough into your 401(k) to snag any employer match. Thatâ€™s like hitting the jackpot with free moneyâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table! If youâ€™re feeling spicy, go ahead and max it out for the tax-deferred gains.

2. **Dive into an IRA**: Next, consider your IRA. If youâ€™re young and expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA is your best budâ€”tax-free gains when you retire? Yes, please! Otherwise, go for a Traditional IRA to snag those tax breaks now.

3. **Casual in the Taxable Pool**: Finally, stash some cash in taxable accounts. These give you flexibility if you need some dough before retirement. Plus, you can invest in cheaper tax-efficient funds here to minimize your tax burden.

Mix and match based on your goals, and keep an eye on how your investments are doing. Adjust as life happensâ€”youâ€™re the master of your financial chessboard!
