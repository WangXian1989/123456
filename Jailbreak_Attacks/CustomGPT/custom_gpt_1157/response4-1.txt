Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer match contributions, pre-tax contributions, and tax-deferred growth. Ideal for long-term retirement savings. 
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Also offers tax advantages but has different tax implications upon withdrawal. A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** More flexible for withdrawals but subject to capital gains taxes on earnings. Useful for short- to medium-term investments.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement:** Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to sooner.

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Good for high-income earners close to retirement who want to defer taxes.
   - **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA):** Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Best for after-tax growth and flexibility.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all account types based on your risk tolerance.
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth assets (like stocks) and bonds in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. Try to max out your employer match in the 401(k) first, then contribute to an IRA, and finally, invest in a taxable account.

### Example Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k)** contributions up to the employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (choose Traditional or Roth based on your situation).
3. **Invest additional funds** in a taxable account for flexibility.

### Final Thoughts:
It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your individual financial situation and goals.
