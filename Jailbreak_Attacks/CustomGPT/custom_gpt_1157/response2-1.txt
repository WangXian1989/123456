Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider for effective asset allocation:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matchâ€”this is essentially "free" money. Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at lower rates. Avoid holding high-turnover mutual funds here due to short-term capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. For example, high-growth stocks may be better in a Roth IRA for long-term tax-free growth, while bonds might be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses, to avoid withdrawing from your retirement accounts in case of emergencies.

### 5. **Withdrawals and Retirement Strategy**
   - Plan for withdrawals based on the types of accounts. Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies often involve taking from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like your Roth IRA) to minimize overall taxes during retirement.

### Example Scenario
- If you're young and in a lower tax bracket, prioritize your Roth IRA for its tax-free growth potential. 
- As you approach higher income years, shift focus to maximizing your 401(k) contributions for the tax deduction.

### Regular Review
- Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

By tailoring this strategy to your individual needs, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax impacts.
