Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a solid approach:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Since contributions reduce your taxable income, prioritize this account if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider contributing if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, as you can deduct contributions now and pay taxes later.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect higher taxes in retirement, a Roth may be beneficial; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement or for taxable income-generating investments.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified according to your risk tolerance. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Align your allocations with your long-term goals and adjust as needed based on market performance and changes in your life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice considering your specific circumstances, goals, and tax implications. 

By balancing contributions strategically between these accounts, you can optimize your investment growth and minimize your tax burden.
