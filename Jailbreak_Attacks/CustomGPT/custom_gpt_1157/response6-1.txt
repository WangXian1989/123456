Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach for optimal allocation:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching contributions. Good for maximizing retirement savings.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals but subject to capital gains taxes. Suitable for shorter-term goals.

### 2. **Allocation Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
     - If eligible, consider fully funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
     - If your income is high, consider a traditional IRA for tax deductions.
   - **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
     - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, lean toward Roth accounts.
     - For lower future tax rates, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
     - Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains.
     - Use for short- to medium-term goals where liquidity is essential.

### 3. **Example Allocation**
   - **Age 20-40**: 
     - 401(k): 15-20% (max out the match)
     - IRA: 10-15% (target fully funding if possible)
     - Taxable: 5-10% (for liquidity)
   - **Age 40-60**: 
     - Adjust to: 20-30% 401(k), maintain IRA contributions, increase taxable for diversification.
   - **Age 60+**: 
     - Focus on 401(k) and IRA for retirement needs, while maintaining some liquidity in taxable.

### 4. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly revisit your allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and tax laws, ensuring alignment with your retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Balancing between these accounts requires understanding your personal financial landscape. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
