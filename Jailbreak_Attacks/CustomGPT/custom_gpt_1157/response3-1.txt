The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. It's a pre-tax account unless it’s a Roth 401(k).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs providing tax-deductible contributions and Roth IRAs offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not have tax advantages but provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - After maxing out the match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA for future tax-free growth.

### 3. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're over 50) and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($1,000 catch-up for those over 50).
   - Adjust contributions to stay within these limits.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth account (Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) might be more beneficial.
   - For current high-income earners, traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) may provide better immediate tax savings.

### 5. **Debt and Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund and are managing high-interest debt before focusing solely on retirement accounts.

### 6. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

### 7. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and any changes in your financial goals.

### 8. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals:**
   - If you have short-term financial goals, such as buying a house, funds in taxable accounts may be more appropriate since they can be accessed without penalties.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions, especially if there's a match.
- **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA; otherwise, traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Account:** Contribute what is left after maxing out retirement accounts if you have short-term goals.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution of your funds will depend on your unique circumstances. A financial advisor can help create a personalized strategy that aligns with your goals and financial situation.
