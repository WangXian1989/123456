To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts provide tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term growth. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any company match, then max out your IRA (if eligible).

2. **Consider Income Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to funds in the short term, allocate a portion to taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility but are less tax-efficient for long-term growth.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all account types. Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, where growth isn't taxed until withdrawal.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as markets fluctuate.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals at retirement. A strategic combination of withdrawals from your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help manage your tax bracket in retirement.

By tailoring your distribution strategy to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon, you can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
