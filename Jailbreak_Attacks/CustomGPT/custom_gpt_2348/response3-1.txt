Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to receive the full employer match if available.
   - **High Contribution Limits:** Utilize the higher contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 for 2023) if you can.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Diversification:** Use IRAs for a mix of investments, including stocks and bonds.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategies:
- **Risk Tolerance:** Consider your risk tolerance when choosing where to invest. Riskier investments can grow in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes.
- **Diversification:** Ensure your overall portfolio is balanced across different asset classes.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 30% 
- **IRA:** 30% 
- **Taxable Account:** 40%

Adjust based on your specific financial situation, goals, and the performance of your investments. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your needs.
