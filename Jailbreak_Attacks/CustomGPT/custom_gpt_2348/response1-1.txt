Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now. However, youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider using a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term growth, stick with more aggressive investments in retirement accounts. In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments to minimize taxes on gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as needed based on market performance and changes in your life situation.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.

Keep in mind your personal financial situation can greatly influence the best approach for you.
