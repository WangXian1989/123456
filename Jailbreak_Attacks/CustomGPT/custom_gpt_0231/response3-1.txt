The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Max out your IRA if eligible (either Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) contributions.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)/Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible, which reduces taxable income now but taxes are paid on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment returns are subject to capital gains taxes and dividend taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon:**
   - Keep long-term investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax deferrals.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid assets or short-term needs (e.g., bonds).

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Stocks:** Favor tax-deferred accounts for higher growth potential.
   - **Bonds:** Consider holding in taxable accounts due to interest income being taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and ensure you're taking full advantage of tax efficiencies.

### 6. **Consider Future Tax Rates:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts now. If lower, traditional options may be better.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach typically emphasizes maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, followed by strategic investments in taxable accounts based on your specific financial situation and goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
