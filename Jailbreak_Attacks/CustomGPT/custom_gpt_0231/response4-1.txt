Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically best for high-growth stocks as you defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Use for investments that may generate higher taxes if held in taxable accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in lower-turnover investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have some liquid savings for emergencies before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your withdrawal strategy from these accounts as you approach retirement to manage tax implications.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.
