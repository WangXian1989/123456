Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income today. Roth 401(k)s allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maximizing retirement account contributions.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - Keep more liquid assets or short-term investments in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After employer matching, allocate funds based on tax efficiency. Generally, contribute to tax-advantaged accounts first, then to taxable accounts.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio to adjust asset allocation based on performance, market conditions, and life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help in creating a tailored strategy based on your unique situation.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax benefits while ensuring you’re prepared for both short-term needs and long-term growth.
