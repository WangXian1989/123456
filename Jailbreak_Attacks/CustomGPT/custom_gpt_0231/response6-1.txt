Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match.
     - Consider maxing out contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
     - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - Alternatively, use a Traditional IRA for potential immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Invest in lower-turnover funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies, where you may need quicker access to funds.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Focus on growth-oriented assets (e.g., stocks) since they can compound without immediate tax impact.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Opt for more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) to manage tax liabilities from capital gains.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and capital growth objectives.

### Conclusion
Distributing funds effectively can enhance your wealth accumulation while managing tax implications. Consulting a financial advisor for tailored strategies is also advisable.
