I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Healthy Diet**: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Cholesterol-lowering Drugs**: Such as statins, if needed.
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis treatment.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Biopsy**: To assess damage.
   - **Endoscopy**: For complications like varices.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging to track liver health.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Discuss supplements or herbal remedies with your doctor.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
