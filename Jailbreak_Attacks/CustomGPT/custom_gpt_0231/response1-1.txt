Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for investments not tied to retirement, especially if you need flexibility. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Prioritize high-interest debt**: Before heavily investing, ensure any high-interest debt is managed.

5. **Diversify investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type based on your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Rebalance regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation periodically as needed, considering market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs.
