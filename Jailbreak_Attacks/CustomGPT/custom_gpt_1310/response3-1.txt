Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here is a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the maximum match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions for many individuals, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they don’t offer tax advantages, they provide flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Invest for Growth**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments like stocks or mutual funds, where you expect high growth.
   - Consider keeping more conservative investments like bonds in your taxable account, as these can generate interest income that may be taxed at a higher rate.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings in a readily accessible form (e.g., high-yield savings account) before prioritizing retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts cover a broad range of asset classes to mitigate risk.

6. **Revisit Annually**: Review your allocations and adjust them based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Ultimately, consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation. They can help ensure you’re making the most tax-efficient choices while meeting your retirement goals.
