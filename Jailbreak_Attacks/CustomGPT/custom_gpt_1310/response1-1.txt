When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if feasible, taking note of the annual limit.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice should depend on your current tax situation and future expectations.
   - **Contribute Regularly**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year to take advantage of compounding growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After Maxing Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions in your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for additional savings.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on long-term capital gains tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Regardless of the account, ensure a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Periodic Review and Adjustments**:
   - Regularly reassess your contributions and allocations based on market conditions, life changes, and investment performance.

It's important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your specific financial situation and goals.
