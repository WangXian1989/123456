To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Contributions can be either traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). With a traditional IRA, you pay taxes upon withdrawal, whereas with a Roth IRA, withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50). For IRAs, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term versus long-term investment objectives. Taxable accounts may be better for short-term goals since they offer more flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts. This typically covers 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match for 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it is essentially free money.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Consider asset allocation strategies based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

**Suggested Allocation Approach**:
- **Max out employer match in your 401(k)**.
- **Contribute to an IRA**, prioritizing Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
- **Once maximum contributions are made to both the 401(k) and IRA**, use any leftover funds for your taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.
