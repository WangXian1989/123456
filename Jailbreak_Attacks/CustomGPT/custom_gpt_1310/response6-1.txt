Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, retirement timeline, and current tax situation. Here are some steps to consider for optimal asset allocation:

### 1. Assess Your Goals and Timeline
   - **Short-term goals**: Consider keeping more funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-term goals**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs.

### 2. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out traditional or Roth IRA contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, ideal for younger investors.

### 3. Evaluate Asset Allocation
   - **Risk tolerance**: More aggressive investments (stocks, mutual funds) can yield higher returns but come with higher risk. Consider your comfort with market volatility.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk (e.g., various sectors, bonds, international investments).

### 4. Monitor Tax Efficiency
   - **Taxable accounts**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) here to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-inefficient investments**: Hold bonds or actively managed funds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest and dividends.

By following these steps, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that aligns with your financial objectives while optimizing for tax implications.
