The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit if you can.
   - **IRA**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement or if you want tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments after you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility, and you can withdraw funds without penalties. However, keep in mind that capital gains taxes will apply to profits.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, younger investors might lean toward growth-focused investments in 401(k) and IRA accounts, while older investors may prioritize more conservative investments in taxable accounts.
   - Tax efficiency is crucial; consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable events.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly, so it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

This balanced approach can help you maximize your retirement savings while considering both tax implications and investment diversity.
