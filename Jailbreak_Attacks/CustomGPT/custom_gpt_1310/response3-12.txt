I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but some common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol and drugs can promote liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function through blood tests can help manage the condition effectively.
4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances can reduce stress on the liver.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always speak to your healthcare provider about the best treatment options for your specific situation.
