Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a 401(k)**: After maximizing employer contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit, especially if it offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Utilize an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). A Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth if you're eligible and plan to withdraw in retirement when you might be in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After funding tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment types, but remember that you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you suspect that you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing a Roth account may be beneficial. Conversely, if you think you'll be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts might be the way to go.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider asset allocation across stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your investments and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to align with your goals and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that fits your specific situation and future needs.
