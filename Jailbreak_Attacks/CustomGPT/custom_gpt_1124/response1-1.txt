Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money!

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** This is often a good place to start since contributions reduce your taxable income. Aim to max out your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction on contributions, while a Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate higher tax burdens, like bonds or REITs, since they may be taxed at a higher rate compared to long-term capital gains from stocks.
   - Think about holding investments that have the potential for high appreciation in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before tying up large amounts in retirement accounts. 

5. **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep in mind your overall asset allocation in relation to your risk tolerance.

6. **Reassess Regularly:** Periodically review your investments and strategy as your situation changes over time.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
