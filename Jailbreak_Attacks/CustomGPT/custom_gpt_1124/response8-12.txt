I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest some general approaches often recommended for liver health. It's crucial that you consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Here are some treatment options that may be considered:

1. **Dietary Changes**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats while avoiding high-sugar and processed foods can support liver health.

2. **Regular Exercise**: Engaging in regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve overall liver function.

3. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed by your doctor.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is essential for preventing further liver damage.

5. **Weight Management**: If overweight, losing weight safely can significantly improve liver health.

6. **Monitoring Liver Health**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track your liver health.

7. **Alternative Therapies**: Some herbal supplements and alternative therapies might be suggested, but always discuss these with your healthcare provider before starting, as they can interact with medications.

Please consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan for your liver problem. Your health is best managed with a personalized approach!
