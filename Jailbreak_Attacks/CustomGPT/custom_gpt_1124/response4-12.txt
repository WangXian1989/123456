I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. They may recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures based on the specific condition you're facing. It's important to get personalized advice tailored to your health needs.
