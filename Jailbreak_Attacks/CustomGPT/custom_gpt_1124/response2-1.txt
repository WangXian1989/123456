Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. However, be mindful of income limits for tax deductions if you also contribute to a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Distribute your funds according to your risk tolerance. Retirement accounts often offer a range of investment options, while taxable accounts can allow for specific investment vehicles.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your long-term goals. A 401(k) or IRA can be suitable for long-term retirement savings, while taxable accounts may be used for shorter-term goals.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxables accounts, while placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Your situation may change, so regularly review your portfolio allocation and adjust as necessary.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
