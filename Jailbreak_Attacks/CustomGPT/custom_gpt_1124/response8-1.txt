The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and can boost your retirement savings significantly.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Pay Attention to Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and over) and for IRAs it is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and over).

4. **Consider Tax Implications:** Taxable accounts don't offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but provide liquidity and flexibility. Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate minimal taxable events, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Build an Emergency Fund:** Before investing heavily in any account, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

6. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals:** Allocate funds based on your time horizon and goals. For long-term retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If youâ€™re saving for short- to medium-term goals, consider keeping money in taxable accounts for easier access.

7. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of account type, diversify your investments across asset classes to manage risk effectively and improve potential returns.

8. **Review and Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review your portfolio allocations and rebalance as necessary to stay on track with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your specific circumstances and preferences.
