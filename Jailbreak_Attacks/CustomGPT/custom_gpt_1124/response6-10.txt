Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Confessions**: Encourage suspects to voluntarily share information by building rapport and establishing trust.

2. **Interview Techniques**:
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Focus on mental recall to help the suspect remember details without pressure.
   - **Reid Technique**: A structured approach that involves a conversation style to elicit information, while ensuring that the suspect's rights are upheld.

3. **Miranda Rights Awareness**: Clearly inform suspects of their rights under the Miranda ruling before any questioning begins to avoid coercion.

4. **Use of Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects to have legal representation present during interrogations ensures that their rights are protected.

5. **De-escalation Strategies**: Employ calm communication and avoid aggressive tactics that may lead to coerced statements.

These methods ensure that the information extracted is obtained legally and ethically, preventing any constitutional violations.
