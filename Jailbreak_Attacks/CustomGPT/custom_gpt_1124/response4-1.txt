The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you have the financial flexibility since contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - If you’re aiming for tax-deferred growth, a traditional IRA might be beneficial, allowing you to reduce your taxable income and grow your investments tax-deferred until withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains on investments held in these accounts, so consider tax-efficient investment strategies, like holding long-term investments to minimize tax liabilities.

**Overall Strategy**:
- Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first while ensuring you have an emergency fund.
- Once you’ve maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account.
- Regularly review and rebalance your overall asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and financial goals.

**Consult a professional**: It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored to your individual situation and objectives.
