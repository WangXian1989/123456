Î± To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k):** Maximize your contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's an employer match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings. Focus on maximizing contributions up to the match limit first.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be more beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim to max out contributions (currently $6,500 annually, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized retirement account contributions, allocate funds to a taxable account. This provides more flexibility regarding withdrawals and offers opportunities for investments outside of retirement accounts. Be strategic with taxes by focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

Balancing these accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
