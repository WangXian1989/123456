I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications can help manage symptoms or address specific issues (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Dietary Supplements**: Some people find benefit from certain supplements, but consult a doctor before trying these.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
