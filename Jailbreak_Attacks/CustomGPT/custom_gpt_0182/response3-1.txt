Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first, as it's free money.
   - Contribute to the limit (for 2023, up to $22,500; $30,000 if over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement.
   - Max out contributions (up to $6,500; $7,500 if over 50 in 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA first.
- **Diversify Investments**: In 401(k) and IRA, choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for expenses or opportunities.

### Monitor and Adjust:

- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as needed based on market performance and your personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
