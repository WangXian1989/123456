To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions, especially if you have a high income. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement or for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your investment mix according to your risk tolerance and goals. Generally, keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax liabilities, possibly taking from taxable accounts first.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
