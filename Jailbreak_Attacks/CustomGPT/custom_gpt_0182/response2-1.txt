Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowable limit, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA (for tax deductibility) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. This is useful for funds you might need before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts, considering asset classes that may be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts (like index funds or municipal bonds).

5. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly assess and adjust your contributions and investments based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
