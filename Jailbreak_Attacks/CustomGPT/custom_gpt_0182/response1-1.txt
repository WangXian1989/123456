Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is free money!
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost funds or index funds that align with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially in a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that might incur capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient funds (like index funds) or tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved.
- **Get a Mix of Growth and Bonds**: Depending on your risk tolerance, aim for a balanced approach.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on market performance and your personal goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 20-30%
- **IRA**: 20-30%
- **Taxable**: 40-60%

### Final Tips
- Stay diversified.
- Keep an eye on fees.
- Age and retirement goals also dictate how aggressive or conservative you should be.
