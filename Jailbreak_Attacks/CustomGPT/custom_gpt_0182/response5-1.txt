Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA (whether traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) contributions, as both have tax benefits.

### 2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Balance your asset allocation among stocks, bonds, and cash within each account according to your risk tolerance.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Invest in more tax-efficient vehicles (like index funds) to minimize tax impact.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement, as 401(k) and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawals.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, or life events.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Be mindful of how withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts will be taxed at retirement.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 20% (max out contributions up to employer match)
- **IRA:** 15% (max out contributions)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10% (for liquidity and flexibility)
- Remainder in diversified investments across those accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your specific situation.
