The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contribution**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute Up to the Limit**: If you can afford it, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount each year (e.g., $22,500 in 2023, plus an additional $7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Determine IRA Type**: Choose between traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax bracket and future expectations. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum limit for IRAs ($6,500 in 2023, plus $1,000 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Consider taxable accounts for goals that are 5+ years away, as they offer flexibility.
   - **Invest Wisely**: Focus on tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxable events.

### Strategy Summary:
- Start with maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA to take advantage of further tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investing, prioritizing low-turnover investments to manage taxes effectively.

### Review Regularly:
- Reassess your strategy annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.
