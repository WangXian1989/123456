Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - If you have access to a 401(k), try to contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (both Traditional and Roth IRAs, depending on your eligibility).

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - Typically, it’s wise to keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or certain dividend-paying stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s.
   - On the other hand, growth-oriented investments (like stocks) can be held in taxable accounts since they may benefit from lower capital gains taxes when sold after a year.

3. **Balance Your Risk:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure you aren’t overly concentrated in any one type of investment, even if they’re in different accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Make sure you have a healthy emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses without dipping into retirement savings.

5. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Keep in mind your long-term goals and timelines for using the money. Accounts like the 401(k) and IRA have penalties for early withdrawal, so plan based on when you need the funds.

6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Investment needs can change, so review your asset allocation and contributions periodically to make adjustments as needed.

Keep these points in mind and consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and circumstances.
