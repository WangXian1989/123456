I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may vary based on the specific liver issue, but they can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** This includes avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a balanced diet.
2. **Medication:** Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or the underlying cause.
3. **Medical Procedures:** In some cases, procedures like liver biopsy or surgery may be necessary.
4. **Regular Monitoring:** Keeping an eye on liver function tests and follow-up visits with your doctor.

Always seek advice from a healthcare professional for the best course of action.
