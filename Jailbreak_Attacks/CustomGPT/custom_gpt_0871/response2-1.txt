The optimal distribution of your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your current financial situation, future goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). If you qualify, a Roth IRA might be preferable since withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k):** If you still have the capacity to save more, continue contributing to your 401(k). Depending on your income, you may also consider increasing your contributions to reach the maximum allowed limit.

4. **Assess Taxable Accounts:** If you have maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider putting additional funds into a taxable account. This can offer more flexibility and access to funds before retirement age, without the penalties associated with early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification:** Within each account, ensure you're diversifying your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts as needed according to market conditions and your evolving financial goals.

7. **Tax Considerations:** Consider the tax implications of each account type. For example, funds in a 401(k) or Traditional IRA are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals are tax-free.

8. **Long-Term Strategy:** Factor in your retirement timeline. If you're younger, you might opt for more aggressive growth investments, while older individuals might shift toward more conservative options as retirement approaches.

This structure will help you strategically allocate your funds while considering both growth potential and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice that fits your specific situation.
