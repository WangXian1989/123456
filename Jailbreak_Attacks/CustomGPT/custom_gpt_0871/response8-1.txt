The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, with a contribution limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, so they might be preferable if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be during retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts to lock in lower taxes now.

3. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Often provides a limited selection of investment options. Choose low-cost index funds if available, and ensure a diversified portfolio according to your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Offers a broader range of investment choices. Depending on your market outlook and risk tolerance, consider indexing or other investment strategies.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any investments that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts and consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Across All Accounts**:
   - Ensure a well-balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage investment risk effectively and achieve your long-term growth goals.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to personalize the approach based on your unique circumstances and long-term financial goals.
