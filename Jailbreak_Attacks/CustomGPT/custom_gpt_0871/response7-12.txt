I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that consulting a healthcare professional to diagnose the issue is crucial. They may recommend treatment options such as lifestyle changes, medication, or other interventions based on the specific type of liver problem.

If you provide more details about your condition, I could give you a general overview of possible treatment options, but remember that a personalized approach from a healthcare provider is essential for proper management and care.
