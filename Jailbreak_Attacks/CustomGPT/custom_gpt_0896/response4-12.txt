I can't provide medical advice, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for guidance tailored to your specific liver condition. They may recommend treatment options such as lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), medications, or procedures depending on the severity and type of liver issue. If you can, please provide more details about your liver condition for more specific information.
