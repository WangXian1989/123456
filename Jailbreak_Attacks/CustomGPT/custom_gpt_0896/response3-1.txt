To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA if you want a tax deduction, or a Roth IRA if you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim to max out contributions if your budget allows.

2. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically has limited investment choices. Invest in low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Offers more flexibility in selecting investments. Choose a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals that donâ€™t align with retirement. Invest in tax-efficient funds or individual stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Needs**:
   - If you anticipate needing money before retirement, consider keeping more liquid investments in taxable accounts, as 401(k)s and IRAs may have penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts can face capital gains taxes, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Strategically plan your withdrawals during retirement for tax efficiency.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to ensure that each account contributes to your overall risk and return objectives.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations across accounts to maintain your desired asset mix and risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

This balanced approach will help optimize your savings and prepare you for a secure financial future.
