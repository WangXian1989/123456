To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you qualify, as they offer tax advantages.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use 401(k) and Traditional IRA for high-income years to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for money you'll need in the short to medium term and to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates on long-term investments.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Choose diverse mutual funds or target-date funds to balance risk and reward.
   - **IRA**: Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to tailor growth based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Reassess your financial situation and investment performance at least annually to ensure alignment with your goals.

By following this strategy, you can maximize the benefits of each account while minimizing taxes and optimizing growth for your future.
