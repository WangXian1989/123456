To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA (based on your income and tax situation).

2. **Balance Contributions Across Accounts**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds here. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, especially if you withdraw before retirement age.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments, such as index funds or ETFs. Take advantage of any target-date funds available.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., tax-exempt bonds or growth stocks) to minimize capital gains taxes. 

**Regularly Review**: Revisit your allocation yearly or after significant life changes to ensure your distribution aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.
