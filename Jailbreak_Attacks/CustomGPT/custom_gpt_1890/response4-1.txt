The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but you won’t pay taxes on withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments, so they can be suitable for short-term goals or for investments you might sell in the near future.

3. **Diversification & Asset Allocation**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) and sectors to manage risk.
   - Consider your age and investment horizon: younger individuals may prioritize growth (more equities), while those nearing retirement might opt for income and preservation (bonds).

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can leave your tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.
