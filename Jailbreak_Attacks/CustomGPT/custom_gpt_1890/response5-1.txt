When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) over taxable accounts. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Diversification of Tax Treatment**: Aim for a balance in tax treatment:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax, but offer flexibility with withdrawals and investments.

4. **Consider Investment Goals and Timeline**: Place assets in accounts based on when you need the funds. For long-term growth, consider stocks in tax-advantaged accounts, since taxes will be deferred until withdrawal.

5. **Keep Emergency Funds**: Ensure you maintain a separate, liquid emergency fund outside of these accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
