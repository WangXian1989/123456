To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Maximize contributions to take advantage of any employer match.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax benefits, but contribution limits are lower. This can be beneficial if you want to lower your taxable income while saving for retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including gains) are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed annually, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth. However, they offer flexibility and access without penalty.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term vs. long-term objectives. Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or expenses, while reserving retirement accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate tax implications on capital gains.

4. **Contribution Prioritization**:
   - Start with your 401(k) to get any employer match, then contribute to an IRA (especially a Roth if eligible), and finally, use any remaining funds for a taxable account.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance, changes in income, tax laws, and changes in your financial goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice that suits your situation.
