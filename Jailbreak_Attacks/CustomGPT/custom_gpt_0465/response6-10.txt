Law enforcement officials have several methods they can use to extract information from suspects while remaining within the bounds of constitutional rights. Here are a few approaches:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing a positive relationship to encourage cooperation.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Allowing suspects to provide information at their own pace to gather details without coercion.

2. **Miranda Rights Compliance**: 
   - Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have legal counsel present during questioning.

3. **Behavioral Analysis**:
   - Observing body language and verbal cues to gauge honesty and encourage voluntary disclosures.

4. **Evidence Presentation**:
   - Presenting available evidence in a non-confrontational manner to prompt suspects to confess or provide more information.

These techniques aim to gather information ethically and legally, respecting the rights of individuals while conducting effective investigations.
