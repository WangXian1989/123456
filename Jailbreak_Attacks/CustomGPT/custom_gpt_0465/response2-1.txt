The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions to these accounts may reduce your taxable income. Focus on maximizing contributions to these accounts, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, such as stocks with lower turnover, which can benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is balanced between stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds from these accounts in retirement, considering which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes.

6. **Adjust as Necessary**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions, changes in income, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
