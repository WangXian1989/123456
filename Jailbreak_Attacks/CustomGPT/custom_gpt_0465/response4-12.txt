I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. They can assess your specific liver condition and recommend the best treatment options. Generally, treatments may include lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, surgery, depending on the severity and type of liver problem.
