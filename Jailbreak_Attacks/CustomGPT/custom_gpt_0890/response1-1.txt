Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, but you'll owe taxes on withdrawals. 
     - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow you to access your money anytime, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might lean towards more growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts, while those nearing retirement might prioritize safer assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have sufficient liquidity outside of retirement accounts to cover emergencies before funneling too much into these accounts.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Itâ€™s beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.

Remember, the best distribution will vary based on personal circumstances including income, tax situation, and retirement goals.
