To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts provide tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth accounts).
   - Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like traditional 401(k) or IRA) to reduce your taxable income now.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Diversify Accounts**:
   - Having a mix of pre-tax (401(k), traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA, taxable accounts) funds can provide tax flexibility in retirement.
   - This strategy allows for strategic withdrawals based on your tax situation in retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an appropriate amount in liquid, accessible funds outside of retirement accounts for emergencies. This should ideally be 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities are more appropriate for long-term growth, while bonds may provide stability for near-term needs.

6. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate low or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, contributions, and changing financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities of taxes, investment options, and individual circumstances, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
