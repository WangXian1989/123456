Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your tax situation, retirement goals, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money you should not leave on the table.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your employer match, consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth based on your eligibility) before putting more into your 401(k). For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have room after maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023 and $30,000 if you're 50 or older). 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in a taxable account can be accessed more easily without penalties, providing liquidity if you need it before retirement. After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable account.

5. **Consider Investment Types**: In a taxable account, consider holding investments that are taxed favorably, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. Tax-efficient funds can also reduce your tax burden in these accounts.

6. **Review Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, regardless of the account type.

7. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: If you need funds for short-term goals, keep those investments in safer vehicles (like cash or bonds) within your taxable accounts. High-risk investments can be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where you won’t need to access the funds for many years.

Always consider seeking the advice of a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
