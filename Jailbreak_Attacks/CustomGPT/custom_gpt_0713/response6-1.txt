To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Contribution Priorities:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching.
   - **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These accounts allow for tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be a strategic choice if you expect your tax rate to increase.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate significant capital gains, as these can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Aim for a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, equities are more suited for long-term accounts (like 401(k) and IRA), while fixed income may be appropriate for taxable accounts to manage tax consequences.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your investment goals by periodically rebalancing your accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax implications. For instance, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution across your accounts to maximize growth and minimize tax liability.
