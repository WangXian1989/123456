When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Take advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Define your short-term vs. long-term goals. Taxable accounts might be better for short-term needs due to their liquidity.

3. **Time Horizon**: 
   - Longer time horizons favor tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter horizons may warrant a mix including taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Align your portfolio’s risk profile with your accounts. More aggressive investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts due to their tax efficiency.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different asset types may perform differently depending on market conditions.

6. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - It may be beneficial to get personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers tax implications, access needs, and your overall financial goals is key.
