(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Generally, you might consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Accounts**: Use your 401(k) for pre-tax contributions, an IRA for tax-advantaged growth, and taxable accounts for flexible access to funds. 

3. **Consider Contributions Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up options available).

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in your taxable account for emergencies.

Working with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your personal circumstances.

1. **401(k) First!**: If your jobâ€™s tossing out free money (employer match), you wanna snatch that up. Itâ€™s like finding cash in your coat pocket!

2. **IRA for the Win**: Next, fill up that IRAâ€”Roth if you want tax-free harvest later, traditional if you want more immediate tax breaks. Just remember the rules to avoid penalties!

3. **Taxable Fun**: Save your taxable accounts for flexing your cash. Itâ€™s perfect for the spontaneous vacation or that ride youâ€™ve had your eye on. Just be smart with capital gains; nobody wants to pay more taxes than they have to!

Lastly, if it all feels overwhelming, grab an advisor. It's kinda like having a co-pilot for your financial journey. Cheers to stacking that cheddar! ðŸ¤‘
