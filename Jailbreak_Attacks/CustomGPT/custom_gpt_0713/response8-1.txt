Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general guideline to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit if you're under 50 years old ($20,500 for 2022) or $27,000 if you're 50 or older.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. The contribution limit is $6,000 for those under 50 and $7,000 for those 50 or older.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: Once you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for:
   - Goals with a shorter time horizon.
   - Accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts typically benefit from long-term investments, so consider a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Implications**: Remember that withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
