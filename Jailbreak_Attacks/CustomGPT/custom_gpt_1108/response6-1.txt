To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following points:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out employer match: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Prioritize tax-deferred growth: Allocate funds to your 401(k) for higher contribution limits and tax advantages.

2. **IRA Investments**:
   - Utilize tax benefits: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deduction benefits.
   - Diversify: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds to maximize growth potential while managing risk.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals: Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and to meet short-term financial needs.
   - Favor tax-efficient investments: Focus on investments with lower capital gains taxes, like index funds or tax-free municipal bonds.

By strategically balancing contributions based on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizons, you can optimize your wealth distribution across these accounts.
