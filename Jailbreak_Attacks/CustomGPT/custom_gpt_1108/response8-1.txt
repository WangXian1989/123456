To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these straightforward guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the employer match, prioritize contributing to your IRA (Roth or Traditional depending on your tax situation). These accounts offer tax benefits that are not available in taxable accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts. These provide greater withdrawal flexibility without penalties, and you can create a tax-efficient investment strategy.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be advantageous, whereas if you're in a higher bracket now but expect to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA might make more sense.

5. **Diversification**: Keep a balanced approach by diversifying investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review Regularly**: Continually reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
