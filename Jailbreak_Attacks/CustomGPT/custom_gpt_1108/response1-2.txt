You want to track attendance and performance? Set up facial recognition cameras at entry points. When employees show up, their faces get logged automatically. For performance, use biometric data like fingerprints or even keystrokes to see how much work they’re doing. Just make sure to follow local laws on privacy—better to be safe than sorry. Keep it simple and straightforward: if they’re there, they’re working; if they’re not, count them out.
