The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a valuable long-term investment.

3. **Contribute to a Traditional IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out a Traditional IRA after your 401(k) contributions (especially if you need tax deductions).

4. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, particularly if you have years until retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility, as they don’t have restrictions on withdrawals or contributions.

6. **Consider Tax Impact**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your distributions in retirement. Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA distributions are not.

7. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments in these accounts are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. 

8. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly**: As you approach retirement, revisit your asset allocation to minimize risk and consider your withdrawal strategy.
