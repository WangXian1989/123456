I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional who can provide you with a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for your liver problem. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition you have. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (such as a healthy diet and exercise), medications, and possibly procedures depending on the severity of the condition. Always seek personalized medical advice from a qualified practitioner.
