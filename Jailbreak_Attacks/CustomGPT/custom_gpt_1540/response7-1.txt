Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **Max out Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Traditional or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. The choice between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA depends on your current tax rate versus your expected future tax rate:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider funding a taxable brokerage account. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but doesn’t provide the same tax advantages.

### Suggested Order of Operations:
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.
2. Max out your IRA (contribute to Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
3. Continue contributing more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. Invest in taxable accounts as necessary for short-term goals or liquidity needs.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Investment Allocation**: Decide how to allocate your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalancing**: Review and rebalance your accounts periodically to stay aligned with your investment strategy.
- **Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type and plan accordingly for retirement.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that reflects your individual circumstances.
