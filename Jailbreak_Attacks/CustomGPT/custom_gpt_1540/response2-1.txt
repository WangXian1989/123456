Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, prioritize contributions to that account first to take full advantage of any matching funds.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. 
   - A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions, whereas a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Generally, you should prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages. The hierarchy typically goes:
     - 401(k) (with match)
     - IRA (Traditional or Roth)
     - Taxable accounts

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Funds in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRAs) are taxed at withdrawal, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. 
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes on earnings and distributions, so they often serve as a supplementary account.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
   - Consider using your taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient (like bonds) to minimize tax implications.

6. **Long-term Goals:**
   - Align your distributions with your financial goals, such as purchasing a house, funding education, or preparing for retirement. Review your allocation regularly to adjust based on life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide insights based on your entire financial picture.

Remember, each person's financial situation is unique, so what works best for you might differ based on personal circumstances, financial goals, and market conditions.
