To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (if eligible). Both the Traditional IRA and Roth IRA offer tax benefits, but the choice between them depends on your current and projected future tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest more in taxable accounts with assets that generate lower capital gains and dividends, such as index funds or ETFs. This can help minimize your tax burden in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider asset allocation strategies that align with your long-term financial goals.

5. **Adjust Based on Tax Brackets**: If you expect your income to change, look at your current and future tax brackets. You may want to prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) if you're currently in a higher tax bracket and switch to Roth accounts when you're in a lower tax bracket.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and your retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure about the best approach, consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your specific circumstances and retirement goals.

By carefully balancing contributions and investments among these accounts, you can maximize your returns while minimizing tax liabilities.
