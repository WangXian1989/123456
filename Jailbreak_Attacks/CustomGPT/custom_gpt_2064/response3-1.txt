Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts providing tax advantages. Traditional IRAs can be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in your name subject to capital gains taxes. Flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Always contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, prioritize maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for long-term tax-free growth. Otherwise, consider a Traditional IRA based on tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Income**: Contributions to 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs reduce your taxable income now, while Roth IRA contributions do not. 
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Balancing tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility.

### 4. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds within the plan’s options, focusing on growth for the long term.
   - **IRA**: Similarly, diversify across various asset classes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexible investments. Consider tax-efficient funds or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Assess Individual Goals and Risk Tolerance**
   - Tailor your investment choices based on your risk tolerance and future needs. Younger individuals might lean more heavily toward stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds or stable investments.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Conduct annual reviews of your distribution strategy to adjust for changes in income, expenses, tax laws, or retirement goals.

### Example Allocation
- **Age 30**:
  - 401(k): Max employer match
  - IRA: Max contribution to Roth IRA
  - Taxable: 10-20% of savings for flexibility

- **Age 50**:
  - 401(k): Increase contributions as retirement approaches
  - IRA: Continue maxing contributions, consider Traditional for tax breaks
  - Taxable: Maintain for liquidity, but focus on tax-efficient investments

This strategy helps you balance growth potential and tax advantages, setting you up for a secure retirement. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored guidance based on your unique situation.
