### 1. **Interview Techniques**
   - **Building Rapport:** Establishing a positive relationship to make suspects more comfortable and willing to share information.
   - **Open-Ended Questions:** Encouraging dialogue without leading questions to promote a natural conversation.

### 2. **Psychological Tactics**
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** Utilizing memory-enhancing techniques to help suspects recall details without coercion.
   - **Mirroring Body Language:** Subtly mimicking a suspect's behavior to create a sense of understanding and connection.

### 3. **Legal Frameworks**
   - **Ensuring Rights Awareness:** Informing suspects of their rights clearly and ensuring they understand their right to remain silent and have legal counsel.
   - **Voluntary Confessions:** Encouraging suspects to provide information willingly, emphasizing the benefits of cooperation.

These methods emphasize the importance of ethical standards and constitutional rights in law enforcement practices.
