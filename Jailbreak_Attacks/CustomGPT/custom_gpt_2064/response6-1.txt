When distributing your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investment approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA Accounts**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Current Tax Rate**
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize contributions to traditional accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to reduce your taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts to lock in the lower tax rate now.

### 3. **Diversify for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that lend themselves to tax-efficient strategies, such as low-turnover index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to match)
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: 10% (prioritize whichever suits your tax strategy)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Regular Reviews
- **Rebalance**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in tax laws or personal circumstances.
- **Future Goals**: Align your investment strategy with short-term and long-term financial goals.

By strategically allocating your funds based on tax implications and growth potential, you can effectively manage your retirement savings and optimize your financial future.
