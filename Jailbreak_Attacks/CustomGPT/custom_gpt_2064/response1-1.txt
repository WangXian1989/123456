Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, if eligible. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Roth contributions are after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later. Traditional IRAs work similarly to 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here may incur capital gains taxes when sold. Consider holding tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

3. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re far from retirement, you might favor growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in all accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, shift toward bonds and conservative investments to preserve capital.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investment types (equities, fixed income, etc.) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on performance and life changes (like job changes, marriage, etc.).

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth and manage tax liabilities effectively.
