Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible (the limit in 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 for those 50 and older).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA (limit of $6,500 or $7,500 if 50+). Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, growing tax-free, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are essential for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties. Use this for investments that generate income not suited for tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., specific stocks or ETFs).
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax; consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower tax rates.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments that benefit from tax deferral (e.g., stocks, mutual funds).
   - In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs, which often have lower turnover and capital gains.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Avoid over-concentration in any one type of asset or account.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and adjust based on performance, market conditions, and changes in financial goals.

### Conclusion
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then assess where to allocate any additional savings. Consulting a financial advisor is also beneficial to create a personalized strategy.
