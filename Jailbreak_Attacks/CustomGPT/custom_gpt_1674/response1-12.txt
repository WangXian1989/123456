I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you that treatment options for liver problems vary depending on the specific condition. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. Medications can also help treat specific conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In severe cases, more serious interventions such as liver transplant may be necessary. Itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Please take care of yourself!
