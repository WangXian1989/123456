To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: A tax-advantaged retirement account offered by employers. Contributions are pre-tax, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged, with potential tax-deductible contributions depending on income and other factors. There are Traditional and Roth IRAs, differing in tax treatment.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't offer tax advantages, but you have flexibility in accessing funds without penalties. Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments at a profit.

2. **Determine Your Goals**: 
   - Clarify whether your focus is on long-term growth (retirement) or short-term liquidity (immediate access to funds). 

3. **Evaluate Your Current Contribution Limits**:
   - For 2023, the maximum contribution limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s, with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're 50 or older.
   - IRA contribution limits are $6,500, or $7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older. 

4. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   Begin by fully funding any employer match in your 401(k), as it's essentially free money.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Maximize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - If you have a Roth IRA option, consider it for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. 

6. **Assess Investment Choices in Each Account**:
   - Focus on higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, as the tax impact is minimized. Conversely, hold more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.

Following these steps will help you make informed decisions about distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, balancing growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity.
