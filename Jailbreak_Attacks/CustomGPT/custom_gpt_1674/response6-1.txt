Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to maximize your returns while minimizing tax liabilities. Here's a structured way to think about the allocation:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Because contributions are made pre-tax, your money can grow tax-deferred until retirement when you withdraw it, potentially at a lower tax rate.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Tax Deductions:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Diversity in Investments:** IRAs often allow for a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s, enabling you to diversify your portfolio effectively.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts allow for more liquidity and investment choices, giving you the freedom to withdraw funds whenever needed without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### **Allocation Strategy**
- Aim to max out the 401(k) and IRA options first for tax advantages, then allocate any excess funds to taxable accounts.
- Regularly review your asset allocation based on your goals, risk tolerance, and changes in tax laws.

By strategically distributing your funds in this manner, you can optimize your investment growth while being mindful of tax implications over the long term.
