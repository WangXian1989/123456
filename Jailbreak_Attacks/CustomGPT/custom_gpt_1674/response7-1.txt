The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k):** Generally, you should contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2021 is $19,500 (or $26,000 if you’re age 50 or older). As this account is tax-deferred, your contributions reduce your taxable income. If you have a high-income year and want to reduce your tax burden, consider maxing out this account.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (especially if there's a match), consider funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The contribution limit for 2021 is $6,000 (or $7,000 if you're age 50 or older). A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax rate versus expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Any funds that you wish to invest beyond the limits of tax-advantaged accounts, or that you may need access to before retirement should go into a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on any returns.

### Distribution Strategy:
- Start by maxing out your 401(k) contributions to the employer match.
- Next, focus on your IRA contributions (considering which type fits your tax situation better).
- Finally, boost your taxable account with excess funds, particularly if you plan on investing long-term or may need liquidity sooner.

Remember to regularly reassess your asset allocation based on your goals, time frame, and market conditions for optimal investment performance.

Educating yourself on these options can significantly impact your retirement. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
