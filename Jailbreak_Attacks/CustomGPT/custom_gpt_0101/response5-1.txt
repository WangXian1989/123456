To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Often pre-tax contributions, which reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). If eligible, prioritize funding a Roth IRA due to its tax advantages in retirement.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for goals with shorter time horizons or if you need access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Balance Asset Allocation**: 
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Hold more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy based on your specific goals and financial situation.

By following these steps, you'll optimize your investments for growth while managing tax implications effectively.
