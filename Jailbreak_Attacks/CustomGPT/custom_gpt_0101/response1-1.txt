Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money!
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

2. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or to access funds without penalties.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when allocating assets.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.
   - Keep investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan to your specific needs.
