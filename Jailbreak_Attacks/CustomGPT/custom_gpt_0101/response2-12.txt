I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications like tenofovir or entecavir may be prescribed.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases, drugs like prednisone might be used.

3. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Resection**: In cases of liver tumors, part of the liver may need to be removed.
   - **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver failure or cirrhosis, a transplant might be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may consider herbal supplements, but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider as they can interact with medications.

Consulting a healthcare professional is essential for a personalized treatment plan.
