To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions before fully funding your 401(k) (especially if your 401(k) has high fees).

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are tax-deferred, making them suitable for investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Consider Asset Location**
   - **Growth Investments (Stocks)**: Prefer tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on high growth.
   - **Income-Producing Investments (Bonds)**: Consider placing these in tax-advantaged accounts to shield interest income from taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changing goals.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your anticipated withdrawal needs and tax implications for retirement.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution that maximizes growth while managing tax implications effectively.
