To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Contribute to Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match to maximize benefits.
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After employer match, focus on funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.
- **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amounts to both your 401(k) and IRA based on your financial situation.
- **Consider Tax Implications**:
  - **Growth Potential**: Use the 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth to defer taxes.
  - **Liquid Access**: Maintain some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and potential short-term needs.
- **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.
- **Reevaluate Regularly**: Review your distribution strategy annually, adjusting for changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

This approach balances tax benefits with accessibility and growth potential.
