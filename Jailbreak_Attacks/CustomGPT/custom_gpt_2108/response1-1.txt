To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
  - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
  - For 2023, 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50) and IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50).

- **Prioritize Employer Match**: 
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching, as this is essentially "free money."

- **Tax Considerations**: 
  - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize taxable interest.
  - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: 
  - Adjust asset allocation based on age, financial goals, and risk tolerance.
  - Younger investors may favor more aggressive growth investments, while those closer to retirement may shift to more stable options.

- **Diversification**: 
  - Ensure your investments across accounts are diversified to reduce risk.

- **Regular Review and Rebalance**: 
  - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to market changes.

- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
  - Personalized advice can help align your investment strategy with your specific financial situation and goals.

By considering these strategies, you can create an effective distribution plan that meets your long-term financial objectives.
