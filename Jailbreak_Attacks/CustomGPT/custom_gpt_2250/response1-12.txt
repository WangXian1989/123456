Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

- **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.
- **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can support liver health.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests help track the condition.
- **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplants may be necessary.
