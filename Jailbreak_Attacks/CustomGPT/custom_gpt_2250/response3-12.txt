I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are commonly discussed for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some potential options:

- **Lifestyle Changes**:
  - Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
  - Avoid alcohol and reduce intake of fatty foods.
  - Stay hydrated and maintain a healthy weight.

- **Medications**:
  - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
  - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
  - Medications to manage symptoms and complications.

- **Regular Monitoring**:
  - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
  - Imaging tests like ultrasound or CT scans to assess liver condition.

- **Surgery**:
  - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

- **Supplements**:
  - Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but always consult your doctor first.

Discuss these options with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
