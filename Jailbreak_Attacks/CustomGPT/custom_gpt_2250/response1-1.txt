To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”it's free money!

2. **Tax Efficiency**:  
   - **401(k)**: Good for tax deferral; often best for high-income earners.  
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Focus on tax diversification. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.  
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for short-term goals; keep investments that generate favorable capital gains or qualified dividends.

3. **Investment Strategy**:  
   - **401(k)**: Use a diversified mix of funds, keeping fees low.  
   - **IRA**: Consider growth-oriented investments since you can leave them to compound tax-free for longer.  
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient funds or stocks to minimize annual tax liabilities.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for future withdrawals to minimize taxes, considering the order of accounts (taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free).

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your allocation based on life changes, market conditions, and tax law updates.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your specific situation.
