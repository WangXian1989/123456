Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments after maximizing retirement accounts; they offer flexibility.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Use for higher-growth investments that appreciate, as you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for investments generating dividends or interest, as those are taxed in the year received.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're younger and far from retirement, focus more on growth in tax-advantaged accounts. Adjust as you approach retirement.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all account types to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan ahead for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement for tax efficiency, considering minimum distributions from tax-deferred accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice may be beneficial based on your unique financial situation and goals.

### Summary
Start with your 401(k) to capture employer matches, contribute to an IRA for tax advantages, and use taxable accounts for flexibility. Always consider tax efficiency and your overall retirement strategy.
