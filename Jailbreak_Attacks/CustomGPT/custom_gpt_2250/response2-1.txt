When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some factors and strategies to keep in mind:

- **401(k)**:
  - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now.

- **IRA**:
  - **Tax Benefits**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider the tax implications. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.
  - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.

- **Taxable Accounts**:
  - **Flexibility**: Money can be accessed anytime without penalties.
  - **Capital Gains Tax**: Understand the tax implications on gains and dividends, which are taxed at different rates than retirement accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Aim for at least the employer match.
2. **Fund an IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments once you've maxed out retirement accounts.

### Ongoing Considerations:
- **Diversification**: Ensure that you have a diversified investment mix across all accounts to manage risk.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation based on changes in your investment goals and market conditions.
- **Future Tax Implications**: Consider your expected tax rate in retirement when deciding between Traditional and Roth accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
