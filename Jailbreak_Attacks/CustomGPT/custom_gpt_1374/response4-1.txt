Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t offer the same tax advantages, but you'll have more flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**: Make sure you have enough liquidity for emergencies or short-term needs, which typically should be in a taxable account or a savings account rather than in retirement accounts.

4. **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate a significant portion of your investments to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth. The earlier you fund these accounts, the more time your investments have to grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your portfolio allocation across these accounts. Rebalance as necessary based on market conditions or changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can assess your entire financial picture.

Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution, and the best distribution strategy will depend on your specific circumstances and financial goals.
