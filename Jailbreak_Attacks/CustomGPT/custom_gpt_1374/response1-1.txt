Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After getting the match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts often have tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account. Traditional accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts are tax-free in retirement. Taxable accounts may incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This could involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Adjust Over Time**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances.

Remember, everyone's situation is different, so tailor your approach to what aligns best with your financial goals!
