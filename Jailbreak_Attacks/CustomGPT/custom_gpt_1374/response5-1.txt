(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Take advantage of any employer match available, as this is essentially free money. Contribute enough to get the full match before putting additional funds into other accounts.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider contributing to an IRA next. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, whereas a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term savings goals or for investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. They are less restricted regarding withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically to your needs.

1. **401(k)**: Max out that employer match first! It's like finding a hidden treasureâ€”don't leave free money on the table!
