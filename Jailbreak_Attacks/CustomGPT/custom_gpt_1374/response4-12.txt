I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional who can provide tailored advice based on your specific condition. They may recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or other treatments depending on the severity and nature of your liver problem. It's important to seek guidance from a qualified expert for any health concerns.
