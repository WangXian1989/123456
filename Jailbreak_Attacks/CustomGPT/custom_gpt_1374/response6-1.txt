Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline to help you optimize your distribution:

1. **401(k) Account**: 
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full employer match (if available).
   - Higher contribution limits: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Assess tax advantages: Determine whether a traditional IRA or Roth IRA aligns with your current and future tax situation.
   - Contribution limits: Ensure you are within the contribution limits set for your age group.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for flexibility: This is ideal for funds you'll need in the short to medium term without penalties.
   - Tax-efficient investing: Focus on long-term capital gains investments and consider utilizing tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 50% of contributions to maximize employer match.
- **IRA**: 30% of contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% for flexibility and liquidity.

### Additional Considerations:
- Reassess your allocations annually based on financial changes or goals.
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation. 

This allocation can help balance growth, tax efficiency, and accessibility.
