Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions:** 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out your contributions to take advantage of the tax benefits, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, you may want to consider contributing to it, as withdrawals can be tax-free in retirement. 
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; however, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Assess your eligibility for deductible IRA contributions based on your income and whether you or your spouse are covered by a workplace retirement plan.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, especially if you want to maintain flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize tax liability.

4. **Diversification:** 
   - Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk with appropriate asset allocation based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

5. **Long-term Planning:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your distributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. 

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized distribution strategy that takes into account your specific circumstances, investment goals, and retirement plans.
