I'm not a doctor, but it's important to speak with a healthcare professional about liver problems as they can provide personalized advice. Generally, treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition, which may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol to help improve liver function.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the type of liver disease, certain medications may be prescribed to manage the condition.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In some cases, particularly with severe liver damage or tumors, surgical options may be considered.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver disease, a transplant may be necessary.

Consulting with a hepatologist or a healthcare professional is crucial for tailored guidance and treatment options.
