When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older.
   - **IRA**: The limit for traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but they don't offer tax benefits like retirement accounts.

2. **Tax Implications**: 
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA may provide immediate tax benefits as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement but offer no immediate tax deduction.
   - Gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, which can vary based on how long you've held the investment.

3. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer matching contribution, prioritize contributions up to the match limit as this is essentially free money.

4. **Investment Choices**: Consider the investment options available in each account type and their associated fees. 401(k) plans may have limited options compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: 
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. 
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals after age 59Â½, provided the account has been open for at least five years.
   - Taxable accounts offer greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

6. **Financial Goals and Timeline**:
   - Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - For long-term retirement savings, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA first.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
2. **IRA Contribution**: Max out a traditional or Roth IRA, based on your eligibility and tax strategy.
3. **401(k) Contributions**: Increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after maxing your IRA.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any extra savings beyond retirement accounts,, especially if you want accessible cash for short-term goals.

### Final Note:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation, considering your risk tolerance, investment objectives, and financial goals. Diversification across these account types can optimize growth and tax efficiency, ultimately benefiting your long-term wealth.
