Deciding how to allocate your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you determine the best distribution for your money among these accounts:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine what you are saving for and your timeline (retirement, buying a house, etc.).
   - Consider your risk tolerance: are you comfortable with market fluctuations, or do you prefer more stable investments?

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan, often with matching contributions. Investment grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions might be tax-deductible, with tax due upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold, but there are no contribution limits.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth (401(k) and IRAs) before taxable accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce little income (like growth stocks) to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Consider allocating different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) as per your investment strategy.

6. **Account Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s ($19,500 for individuals under 50, $26,000 for those 50 and older as of 2021) and IRAs ($6,000 under 50, $7,000 for those 50 and older).

7. **Adjust For Taxes**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prefer Roth IRAs for their tax-free withdrawals. 
   - For those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional IRAs might be more beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, adjusting contributions as necessary.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can devise a strategy that maximizes the benefits of each type of account while aligning with your financial goals.
