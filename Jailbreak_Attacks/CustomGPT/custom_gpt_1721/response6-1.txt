Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.
  
2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that may be taxed at lower rates. They can also provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors may lean more heavily toward stocks, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds for stability.

4. **Rebalancing Strategy:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix, accounting for market fluctuations and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement, purchasing a home, or funding education.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your funds among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts based on your individual financial situation. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your needs.
