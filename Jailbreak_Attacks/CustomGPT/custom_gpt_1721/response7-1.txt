To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax and reduce your taxable income; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing qualified withdrawals to be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held here are subject to capital gains tax when sold and income tax on dividends.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out an IRA if you qualify, particularly a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, allocate funds to your taxable investments for flexibility and liquidity.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Reassess Regularly**: 
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio regularly as your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals may change.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds among your retirement and taxable accounts, maximizing growth while managing taxes.
