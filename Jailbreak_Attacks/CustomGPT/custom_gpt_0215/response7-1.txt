Distributing your money among different types of accounts—such as your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to allocating your investments:

1. **401(k)**: Since contributions to a 401(k) are made with pre-tax dollars, this account can be advantageous for tax-deferred growth. If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to capture the full match. This is often considered "free money" and a priority.

2. **IRA**: Investing in a traditional IRA offers similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider it for after-tax contributions that can grow tax-free. The choice between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA should depend on your current tax rate versus expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Taxable accounts are more flexible, allowing you to withdraw money anytime without penalties. However, they don't offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. These accounts can be useful for short-term investment goals, such as saving for a home or starting a business, where you might need access to your funds sooner.

**General Strategy**:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions at least to the employer match.
- Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible and want tax-free growth.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that you plan to access before retirement or that don't fit neatly into a tax-advantaged structure.
- Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance growth, risk, and tax implications.

Given these points, create a distribution strategy that aligns with your retirement goals and personal financial situation. It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored approach.

Happy investing!
