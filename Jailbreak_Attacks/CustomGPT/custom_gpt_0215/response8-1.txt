Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider, along with their pros and cons:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)
- **Pros**: Free money from employer matches; contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
- **Cons**: Limited investment choices compared to IRAs.

### 2. Contribute to IRA after Employer Match
- **Pros**: Greater investment options; potential for tax-free growth in a Roth IRA, or tax-deferred growth in a traditional IRA.
- **Cons**: Contribution limits can be lower than a 401(k).

### 3. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- **Pros**: Access funds without penalties; suitable for short-term goals.
- **Cons**: Capital gains taxes on earnings; interest and dividends are taxable.

### 4. Asset Location Strategy
- **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.
- **Higher-Tax Investments in Retirement Accounts**: Place assets that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. Withdrawals and Retirement Timeline
- Consider how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds during retirement. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often works best:

- **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match, then contribute enough to reach the annual limit.
- **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA up to its limit, focusing on tax-advantaged growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexible savings or as a bridge to retirement before accessing tax-advantaged accounts.
