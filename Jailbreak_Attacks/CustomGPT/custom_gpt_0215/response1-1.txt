I'm glad you're taking an interest in managing your investments! While I can provide general guidelines on distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to tailor your strategy to your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, age, and tax situation. Here are some pros and cons of each account type to help you decide:

### 401(k) Plans
**Pros:**
- Often includes employer matching contributions, which can effectively increase your investment.
- Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
- Higher annual contribution limits compared to IRAs.

**Cons:**
- Limited investment choices often dictated by the plan.
- Withdrawals before age 59½ may incur penalties.

### IRA (Individual Retirement Account)
**Pros:**
- Tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) can reduce taxable income.
- Tax-free growth (Roth IRA) if conditions are met.
- More investment options compared to many 401(k) plans.

**Cons:**
- Lower annual contribution limits than 401(k)s.
- Income limits for contributions to Roth IRAs.

### Taxable Accounts
**Pros:**
- No contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions.
- Flexibility to access funds whenever needed.
- You can invest in any asset without the tax advantages and limitations of retirement accounts.

**Cons:**
- Earnings and dividends are taxed in the year they are generated (short-term capital gains versus long-term).
- Less favorable tax treatment compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before prioritizing other accounts.
2. **Fund an IRA:** If eligible, consider maximizing your IRA contributions. If you’re going for a Roth IRA, keep your tax situation in mind.
3. **Back to Your 401(k):** After maximizing your IRA, return to your 401(k) and continue contributing up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments, especially if you have short-term goals or need flexibility.

### Final Thoughts:
Before implementing any strategy, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution based on your unique circumstances. They can provide personalized advice for managing your investments effectively.

Happy investing!
