I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieve a healthy weight through diet and exercise.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For hepatitis, medications like entecavir or tenofovir may be prescribed.
   - **Anti-inflammatory Drugs**: To reduce inflammation in chronic liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Imaging Tests**: Ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs to assess liver condition.
   - **Blood Tests**: Regular liver function tests to monitor enzyme levels.

4. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Resection**: In cases of liver tumors, a portion of the liver may be surgically removed.
   - **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver damage or failure.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
