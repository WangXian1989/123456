Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out your contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA that allows for tax-free growth.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If retirement is far away, prioritize growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you get closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments to reduce risk.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Adjust**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation and contributions periodically based on your changing goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
