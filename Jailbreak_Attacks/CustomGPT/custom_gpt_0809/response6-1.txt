To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Max out your 401(k)** contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This reduces taxable income and grows tax-deferred.
   - **Contribute to an IRA** (Traditional or Roth) next, depending on your income eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth on withdrawals.

### 2. **Balance Your Contributions**
   - Allocate funds based on your goals:
     - **Short-term needs:** Focus on taxable accounts for liquidity.
     - **Long-term growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for potential growth and tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts often offer tax deferral or tax-free growth. Withdrawals in retirement may be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding long-term investments to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) to manage risk and return potential.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on performance, goals, and changes in income.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while considering your investment goals will optimize growth and manage tax liabilities effectively.
