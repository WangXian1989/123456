Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The annual limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be useful for investments you may want to access before retirement. Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment time frame. Generally, you might take more risks in accounts meant for long-term growth (like your 401(k) and IRA) and have a more conservative approach in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to reduce risk and enhance potential returns. Ensure that you maintain a balanced overall portfolio.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or life events (like a new job or family changes).

### **Summary**
Start with tax-advantaged accounts, considering your retirement goals, and then use taxable accounts for flexibility. Diversify and regularly adjust your strategy based on your financial situation. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
