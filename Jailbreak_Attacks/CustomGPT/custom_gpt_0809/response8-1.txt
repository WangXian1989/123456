Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contribution**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. This could be after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Balance Risk and Return**: Diversify your investments across all accounts while considering risk tolerance and desired asset allocation.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts based on tax implications and your retirement income needs.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly reassess your contributions and investment performance to ensure alignment with your goals.
