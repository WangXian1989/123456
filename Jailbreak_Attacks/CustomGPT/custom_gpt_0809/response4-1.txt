To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, contribute to your 401(k) up to its limit, which is $22,500 in 2023 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might incur higher taxes, like stocks with lower turnovers or tax-efficient funds.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Keep high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize compounding.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts while considering risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**: 
   - Short-term goals can be better suited for taxable accounts for accessibility, while long-term retirement goals can prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Periodically assess your allocations and adjust according to changes in market conditions, personal circumstances, or financial goals.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
