Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider traditional vs. Roth options based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute up to the annual limit. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions now.
   - **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Access**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties, making them good for shorter-term goals.
   - **Invest Wisely**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved.
- **Diversity of Accounts**: Spread your investments across different account types to manage tax liability effectively.
- **Asset Allocation**: Adjust based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon; consider placing growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

Review and adjust your strategy periodically based on your financial situation and goals!
