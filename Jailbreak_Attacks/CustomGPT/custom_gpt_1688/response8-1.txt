Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider funding your IRA (or Roth IRA, if eligible) after maximizing your 401(k) match. IRAs often have broader investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, so you'll be taxed on withdrawals. These are typically better for higher-income years.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains tax. Use these for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that across your accounts, you maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out to get the match (if employer offers it).
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed (limit varies by year).
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds for additional investment, focusing on tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your particular situation and goals.
