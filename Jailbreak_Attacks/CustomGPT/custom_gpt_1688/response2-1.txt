Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then consider Roth vs. traditional depending on your tax outlook.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA for additional tax benefits. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals (Retirement):** Lean more towards tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate assets across different accounts based on tax implications. For example, place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Understand Withdrawal Rules:**
   - Keep in mind that withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can have penalties if taken before retirement age, while taxable accounts can be accessed without such restrictions.

### 5. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Rates:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. Conversely, if you expect lower taxes in retirement, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

### 6. **Rebalance and Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance to ensure you maintain your desired risk level across accounts.

### Example Asset Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Maximize employer match, then contribute to the limit.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions, ideally one Roth and one traditional if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that may generate capital gains or that require more liquidity.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation, as they can provide insights based on your unique financial landscape.
