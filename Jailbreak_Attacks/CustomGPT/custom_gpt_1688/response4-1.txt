Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to benefit from any employer matching, which is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are pre-tax, so it can lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Maximum Flexibility**: These accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Investments held longer than a year are taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions First**: At least up to the company match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and tax filing status, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing and flexibility.

### Balancing Act:
- Keep a mix of investments across all accounts for diversification.
- Consider tax implications when withdrawing funds in retirement.

Evaluating your personal situation, including your tax bracket, investment horizon, and retirement needs, is crucial. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.
