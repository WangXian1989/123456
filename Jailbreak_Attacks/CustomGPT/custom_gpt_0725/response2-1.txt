To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax-deferred contributions and potential employer match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings, with traditional IRAs allowing tax-deductible contributions and Roth IRAs allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts with no tax advantages, but with more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term needs. Taxable accounts are better for short-term goals, while retirement accounts are ideal for long-term growth.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as it is essentially "free money."
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributions to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax impact.
   - Consider holding investments that appreciate in value (like stocks) in taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance your investments periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for distributing your funds across your accounts.
