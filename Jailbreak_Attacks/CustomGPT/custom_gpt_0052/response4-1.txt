Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA (traditional or Roth). These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your money grow more effectively.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient or for goals that are shorter-term. Consider holding investments in these accounts that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income to minimize tax impact.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investment types across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, you might want higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from potential tax-free growth.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, taking into account the different tax implications of each type of account.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As retirement approaches, consider how withdrawals will be taxed. Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies can minimize your tax burden during retirement.

It's beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
