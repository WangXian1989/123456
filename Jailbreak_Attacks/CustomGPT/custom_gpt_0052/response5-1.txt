The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize the 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider maxing out an IRA for additional tax benefits. Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once youâ€™re maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. These can provide access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Consider Your Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes and the tax implications of withdrawals from different types of accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your distribution strategy regularly, especially if your financial situation or tax laws change.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
