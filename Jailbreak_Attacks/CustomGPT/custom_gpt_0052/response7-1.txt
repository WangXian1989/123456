Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages depending on your income and tax bracket.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding investments with high potential for capital gains in tax-advantaged accounts (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize taxable events.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Use these accounts for higher growth investments, as you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use a balanced portfolio strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance. Generally, place more aggressive investments (like equities) in tax-deferred accounts due to their growth potential and tax deferral.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. Then, strategically withdraw from IRAs and 401(k) to manage your tax bracket.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.
