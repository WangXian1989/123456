To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Target Retirement Accounts**: If your plan offers target-date funds or low-cost index funds, these can be great for long-term growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions). This decision often depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to maximize contributions to your IRA, especially if you’re in a lower tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Considerations for Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that aren’t suitable for tax-advantaged accounts (like short-term trading or assets expected to appreciate significantly).

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your total portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and your changing risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax implications (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first).

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
