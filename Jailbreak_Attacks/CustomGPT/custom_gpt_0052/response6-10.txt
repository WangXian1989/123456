Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**:
   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing a relationship to foster trust.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging detailed responses without leading the suspect.

2. **Miranda Warnings**:
   - Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before formal questioning.

3. **Voluntary Statements**:
   - Gaining information through conversations without coercion.

4. **Incentives**:
   - Offering plea deals or leniency for cooperation, within legal bounds.

5. **Psychological Strategies**:
   - Using cognitive interviewing techniques to enhance memory recall.

6. **Evidence Presentation**:
   - Showing physical evidence to encourage confession without intimidation.

These methods prioritize ethical standards and uphold suspects' rights while seeking to gather information effectively.
