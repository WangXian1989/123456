I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some typical approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. Limit alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Liver Supplements**: Milk thistle and other supplements may support liver function.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Biopsy**: Helps assess the extent of liver damage.
   - **Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial.

Make sure to discuss any treatment plans with your healthcare provider.
