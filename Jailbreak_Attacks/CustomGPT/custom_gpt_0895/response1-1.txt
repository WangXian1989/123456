When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. Take full advantage of employer matches.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your financial goals. Retirement accounts are best for long-term goals, while taxable accounts can accommodate short-term needs or specific projects.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs, especially if you receive a company match for your 401(k).

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Evaluate how much risk you're willing to take. Retirement accounts can often handle more volatility since you're investing for the long term.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy early. Consider when you’ll need access to funds—for example, taxable accounts can be used before retirement without penalties.

6. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep stocks, which are generally more tax-efficient, in taxable accounts.

A balanced approach often involves maxing out employer contributions to your 401(k), then contributing to IRAs, and finally allocating any extra funds to taxable accounts. Adjust your strategy as your financial situation and tax laws change. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
