I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest general approaches. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Specific drugs can target underlying issues like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Eating a balanced diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver health.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to track liver function.
4. **Supplementation**: Some vitamins and minerals may support liver health, but discuss with your doctor first.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult your healthcare provider for a tailored treatment plan.
