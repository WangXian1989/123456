The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guide to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - Short-term (less than 5 years): Consider keeping funds in a taxable account for flexibility.
   - Long-term (5 years or more): Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50+).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA ($6,500 limit for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50+). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient vehicles, like index funds or tax-managed funds. Taxable accounts can be useful for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Avoid high-turnover investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance returns. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth assets like stocks, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Generally, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust the allocations in each account to maintain your desired investment strategy and risk tolerance.

It's often recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
