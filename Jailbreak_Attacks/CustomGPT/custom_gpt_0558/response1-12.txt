I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver issues, but please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Here are some typical approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet, reducing saturated fats, and avoiding alcohol can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and help with weight management.
   - **Weight Loss**: Losing weight can significantly benefit liver health for many conditions, especially fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**: 
   - For conditions like hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - Corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory drugs might be used for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.
   - Management of associated conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol.

4. **Interventional Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like endoscopy or even surgery may be necessary to address complications.

5. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - For advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, a transplant might be the only option.

Consult with a liver specialist (hepatologist) for the most suitable treatment tailored to your specific condition.
