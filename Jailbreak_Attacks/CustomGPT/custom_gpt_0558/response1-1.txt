Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a simplified approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA/401(k))**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. 
   - **Traditional IRAs** can provide tax deductions now, while **Roth IRAs** offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to earlier, as they don’t have withdrawal restrictions like retirement accounts.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses in an easily accessible account.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across these accounts to balance risk and return. Younger investors might lean more heavily toward stocks, while those nearing retirement may prefer bonds.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement plans.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

This framework can help you optimize your savings strategy while taking advantage of tax benefits.
