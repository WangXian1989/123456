I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on common treatment options for liver issues. The best options will depend on the specific condition you have. Here are a few general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve overall liver health.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver recovery.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These can reduce inflammation in cases of autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Cholesterol-lowering drugs**: They may help if high cholesterol is a factor.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - **Regular Check-ups**: Frequent monitoring of liver function tests can help manage your condition.
   - **Vaccinations**: Vaccines for hepatitis A and B can prevent further issues.

4. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
