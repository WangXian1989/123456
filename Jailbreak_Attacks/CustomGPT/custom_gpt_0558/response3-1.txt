Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, current income, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - **Short-term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the next few years.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute the maximum to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as regular income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate investments based on account type. For example:
     - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds).
     - **IRA:** Consider a mix, depending on your risk tolerance.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocation periodically and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized strategies can help optimize your allocation based on your specific circumstances.

### General Allocation Example:
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%

This is a flexible framework; adjust according to your specific situation and preferences.
