When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, time horizon, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes when investments are sold for a profit. They offer more flexibility and access to funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to minimize risk. This can also help with tax efficiency, as you can place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or reduce taxes.

4. **Time Horizon**: If you have a longer time until retirement, you might choose to hold more stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term growth. In your taxable accounts, you may want to focus on more stable investments or tax-efficient funds.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: As you near retirement, consider how you'll withdraw money from each account. A common approach is to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategy, it may be beneficial to seek personalized guidance from a financial advisor.

Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Assess your personal situation, future needs, and consult with a professional if necessary to determine the best allocation for you.
