Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be an essential part of your financial strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often, this is a good place to start, especially if you have a high-income phase.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for investments that are likely to generate high taxable income (like bonds) or that are expected to appreciate significantly (like stocks).
   - Invest tax-efficient assets in your taxable accounts, such as index funds or stocks that produce long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversified Asset Allocation**: Maintain a consistent asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk and ensure diversification. Rebalance periodically as market conditions change.

5. **Flexible Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. It may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first and defer tax-advantaged accounts for later.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Monitor your investments regularly and adjust your contributions based on changes in your income, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific goals and circumstances.

This distribution strategy will depend on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals, so customize it to fit your unique situation.
