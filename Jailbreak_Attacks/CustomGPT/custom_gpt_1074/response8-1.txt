The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure you contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as a 401(k) or Traditional IRA. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred, which can be beneficial in the long run.

3. **Consider Roth Options**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free, which can be a valuable benefit if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Within your accounts, aim for a diversified portfolio. This means a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be useful if you need access to funds before retirement.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio as needed. Market fluctuations can alter your original allocation strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about how to allocate your money or need personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help you develop a tailored strategy based on your financial goals.

Ultimately, the distribution should align with your overall financial strategy, taking into account future income needs, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Make sure to adjust your allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.
