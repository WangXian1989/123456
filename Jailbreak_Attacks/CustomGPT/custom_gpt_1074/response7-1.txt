When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach to optimize your tax situation and retirement savings. Here are some fundamental guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to start building your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), allowing for tax-deferred growth. Traditional 401(k) distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Also offers tax advantages. Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.

3. **Diversify Account Types:** Balancing between tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable accounts can help you manage your tax liabilities in retirement:
   - Set aside enough in 401(k) and IRA accounts to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - Use a taxable account to maintain flexibility for withdrawals and tax planning.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket:** Your current and expected future tax brackets will influence where to allocate your funds. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts may be advantageous.

5. **Investment Strategy:** Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - **401(k):** Often has limited investment options. Ensure that youâ€™re selecting a diversified mix of investments suitable for your age and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA:** Generally offers a wider range of investment options, allowing for potentially better returns based on your strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Regularly Review Your Distribution:** Life changes, market conditions, and tax laws may impact your distribution strategy. Regularly revisit your allocations to ensure they still align with your financial goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that accounts for your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications.

In summary, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, then assess whether to contribute more to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation and future expectations, while also keeping some liquid assets in a taxable account for flexibility.
