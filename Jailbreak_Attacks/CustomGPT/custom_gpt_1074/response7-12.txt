I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed.
3. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease or failure, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment for your specific situation.
