Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, prioritize contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility for withdrawals and investing in assets that might produce favorable tax treatments, like long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well diversified. Different account types can have varying tax implications, so consider asset location; for instance, keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

5. **Adjust for Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing money from each account type to optimize your retirement income strategy.

6. **Regular Review**: Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
