I'm not a doctor, but I can give you a general overview of some common treatment options for liver issues. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some options that might be considered based on the specific liver problem:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol, saturated fats, and sugary foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications might be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Treating related issues like diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity can help improve liver health.

4. **Liver Therapies**: 
   - For conditions like hepatitis, antiviral treatments may be available.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies may be needed to monitor liver health and function.

6. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, surgical procedures or even a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to discuss the best options for your specific situation.
