Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**  
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, try to at least contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement; traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now but tax you on withdrawals later.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**  
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Balance Contributions Based on Income**  
   - In higher-income years, consider maxing out pre-tax contributions (like a 401(k)) to reduce taxable income.
   - In lower-income years, it might be beneficial to focus on a Roth IRA, where you pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals later.

### 4. **Estimate Your Retirement Tax Rate**  
   - If you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. If you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts can be more beneficial.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**  
   - Spread investments across asset classes within each account type. Stocks may be growth-oriented in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might be placed in taxable accounts for income, depending on your situation.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**  
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial goals, or significant life events.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**  
   - Personalized advice from a professional can help tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.

By considering these strategies, you can create a distribution plan that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
