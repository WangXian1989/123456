Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If traditional, your contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **401(k)**: If you have maxed out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k).

3. **Consider Tax Structure**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax implications (like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends).
   - **Active Trading**: If you plan on frequent trading, keep this in a tax-advantaged account to defer taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your investment strategy. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can go in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
