Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for high contribution limits and tax deferral. Consider maxing this out if you have high income or anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: This can provide additional tax benefits. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be funded after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility but can have tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Assess the investment choices available in each account. Your 401(k) may have limited options compared to an IRA or taxable account.

4. **Monitor Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may be used for investments that generate lower tax consequences, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Periodically Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can further personalize these strategies to your unique situation.
