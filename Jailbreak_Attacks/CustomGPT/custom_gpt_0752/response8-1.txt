Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment choices available in your 401(k); they can vary widely.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now but tax you during withdrawals. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement if rules are followed.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the lower contribution limits compared to a 401(k).
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs may offer a wider range of investment options than employer-sponsored plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility for mid-term goals or unexpected expenses.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Income Considerations**: Consider the impact of dividends and interest income on your overall tax situation.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before contributing heavily to investment accounts, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund.
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to fully capitalize on your 401(k) and IRA contributions if you can, as they offer significant tax advantages.
- **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, ensure a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Example Distribution:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- If you can, fully fund your IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you qualify and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- Utilize taxable accounts for additional investment once youâ€™ve maximized your tax-advantaged contributions.

### Reassess Regularly:
Review your distribution strategy annually or as your financial situation changes, adjusting contributions based on income changes, tax law updates, or shifting goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
