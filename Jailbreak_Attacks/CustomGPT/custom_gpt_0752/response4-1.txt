Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial for high earners.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Consider contributing to both types if eligible. This can give you flexibility in withdrawals and tax management.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Use these for short-term goals or emergency funds, as they offer more flexibility without penalties for withdrawal.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or assets (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) to minimize capital gains tax.

**General Tips**:
- **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might prioritize growth in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to balance between accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Keep your overall asset allocation consistent across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
