To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions thereafter to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, select based on your current tax bracket and expected future income. Max out these contributions if possible.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may yield long-term capital gains (e.g., stocks) to benefit from potentially lower tax rates. Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains if applicable.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts, keeping in mind the tax implications of each account type. 
   - For instance, consider holding higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage taxes efficiently.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals to ensure alignment with your investment strategy.

This structured approach can optimize your overall investment returns while minimizing taxes. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
