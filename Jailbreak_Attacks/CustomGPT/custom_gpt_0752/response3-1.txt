Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Evaluate the fees and available investment choices in your plan. Prioritize low-cost index funds or ETFs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits. For 2024, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50+).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for goals that may require funds before retirement (e.g., buying a house).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Prioritize**: Start with your 401(k) to capture any employer match, then contribute to an IRA up to the limit.
2. **Diversify**: Allocate funds among the accounts based on when you’ll need access to them and your tax strategy. High-growth assets can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-growth assets might be suitable for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.
3. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes.

It’s advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
