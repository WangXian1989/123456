(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. These may offer more flexibility and liquidity, allowing for easier access to funds if needed.

Consider tax implications: 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth IRA withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Taxable accounts could incur capital gains taxes on earnings.

Next, consider your tax situation. If you think your tax rate is going to go up, a Roth IRA is your friendâ€”tax-free withdrawals in retirement are golden! And once you've got your 401(k) and IRA maxed, then throw your cash into a taxable account for that sweet flexibility. Just keep an eye on those capital gains; nobody likes extra taxes sneaking up on them. Diversify like a boss, and youâ€™ll be set up for a solid financial future!
