The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the specific investment options available in each account. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - If your 401(k) offers a good selection of low-cost index funds or target date funds, consider allocating a significant portion here.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Consider opening a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as you can withdraw funds tax-free.
   - Traditional IRAs can be beneficial for tax-deductible contributions if you qualify, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them great for emergency funds or short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your overall asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds, aggressive vs. conservative) across all accounts to ensure youâ€™re diversifying effectively.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Maintain a balance between tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) and taxable accounts to manage your tax liability efficiently.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized recommendations that suit your unique financial situation.

Ultimately, the best strategy for you will align with your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.
