To provide you with the best guidance on distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I’ll need to gather some information about your financial situation. 

1. What is your current age, and when do you plan to retire?
2. What is your risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)?
3. How much do you currently contribute to each account type annually?
4. Do you have any employer matching contributions for your 401(k)?
5. Are you aiming for specific financial goals beyond retirement (e.g., buying a home, funding education)?

Let’s start with your age and retirement plans!
