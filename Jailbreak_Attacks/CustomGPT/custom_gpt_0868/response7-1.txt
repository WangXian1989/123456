The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current income, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing a Roth account might be beneficial.

3. **Diversification of Accounts**: You might want to balance contributions across these accounts to have a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged funds. 

4. **Consider Investment Options and Fees**: Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) compared to your IRA and taxable accounts. If your 401(k) has high fees, you might want to focus on IRAs and taxable accounts instead.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you get closer to retirement, consider how you will draw from these accounts. Having a strategy about which accounts to withdraw from first can minimize taxes.

6. **Personal Goals and Risk Tolerance**: Ultimately, your individual financial goals and risk tolerance will play a significant role in how you distribute your investments.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
