Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as that's essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Next, think about contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, putting money into a taxable account can provide flexibility and access to your funds without penalties. This is ideal for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.

Itâ€™s also important to consider your overall investment strategy, risk tolerance, and whether you're aiming for growth or income. A balanced approach might involve contributing to all three account types in a way that aligns with your goals.

To get more tailored advice, consider talking to a financial advisor who can help you develop a strategy suited to your specific situation. Would you like to dive deeper into any of these options?
