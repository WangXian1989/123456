The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth), which can lower your taxable income now. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this might be a good option.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions (pre-tax), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current tax situation and expected future tax bracket.
  
3. **Emergency Fund and Debt Management:** Ensure you have adequate liquidity in a savings account before aggressively funding retirement accounts. Additionally, if you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before significantly investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts, especially for short- to medium-term goals. Taxable accounts offer flexibility and can be used for various financial goals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Diversification:** Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to reduce risk. A balanced portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets is generally advised.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If youâ€™re uncertain, consider meeting with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that leverages the tax advantages of each account type while considering your immediate financial needs and long-term goals will likely serve you best.
