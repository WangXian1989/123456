The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider making contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. This allows for tax-advantaged growth and, in the case of a Roth IRA, tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) contributions**: After maxing out the IRA contributions (if feasible), continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in taxable accounts**: If you have additional funds after utilizing the above options, you can invest in taxable accounts. They're flexible and provide liquidity but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify your investments**: No matter where you invest, ensure a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Consider tax implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawals. Generally, traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified Roth withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

7. **Rebalance periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocation based on performance and shifting financial goals.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that suits your specific circumstances.
