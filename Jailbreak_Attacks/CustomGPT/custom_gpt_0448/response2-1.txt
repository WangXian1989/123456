The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating money elsewhere.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), but you may need to meet certain income requirements for deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties. Consider this for short-term needs or specific goals.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and spreading risk. More aggressive investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts that have a long time horizon, while more conservative investments could be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawals and Timing**: Think about when you plan to access your money. If it's for retirement (long-term), tax-advantaged accounts are usually better. If you need funds sooner, a taxable account may be more appropriate.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or investment performance.
