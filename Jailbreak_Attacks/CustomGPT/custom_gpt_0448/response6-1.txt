Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Investment Needs and Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for investments you're likely to use in the short term or for flexibility. Consider placing investments that produce income or are more volatile in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Typically, stocks are suited for long-term growth and should be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or conservative investments can be held in taxable accounts.

3. **Regularly Reevaluate Your Strategy:**
   - Monitor the performance of your accounts and make adjustments based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.
   - Consult with a financial advisor to optimize your distribution based on your specific circumstances.

This strategy aims to enhance tax efficiency while aligning with your overall financial objectives.
