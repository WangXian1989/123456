To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax which reduces your taxable income. Focus on maxing out employer matching contributions first since it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your tax situation, choose between a Traditional IRA, which gives you a tax deduction when you contribute, or a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your distributions with your short-term and long-term goals. Use the 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth while using taxable accounts for more immediate needs or goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Make sure your overall investment strategy is diversified across the accounts. Consider what assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) are held in each account type for tax efficiency.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it’s better to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type to maximize your tax-advantaged savings.
