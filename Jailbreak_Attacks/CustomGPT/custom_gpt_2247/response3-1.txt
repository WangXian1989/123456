Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a recommended approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maxing out your IRA contributions, increase your contributions to your 401(k), particularly if it offers a good range of investment options and low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Allocate funds to a taxable account for flexibility and access. This can be useful for short- to medium-term financial goals.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts. Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as income, while capital gains and dividends in taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates (long-term capital gains).

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also be beneficial for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
