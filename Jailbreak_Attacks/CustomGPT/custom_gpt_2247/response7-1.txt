Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible, especially during your peak earning years.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is better based on your current tax rate versus expected retirement tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and the deadlines.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you need to access funds before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the match.
- If you have the ability to exceed the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional).
- Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, ensuring you maintain liquidity for emergencies or short-term goals.

### General Tips:
- **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified.
- **Review Annually**: Regularly revisit your asset allocation based on changing goals, market conditions, and life events.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and future goals.

A balanced approach, considering both tax implications and liquidity needs, will help optimize your long-term wealth.
