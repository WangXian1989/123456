Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, you might benefit from a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Ongoing Contributions**
   - **Establish a Regular Investment Plan**: Make consistent contributions to all accounts, adjusting based on your cash flow and changing financial goals.

### 4. **Revisit Regularly**
   - **Monitor and Adjust**: Review your allocations and contributions periodically, especially as you approach retirement to ensure alignment with your objectives and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Evaluate your overall financial situation and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice. Setting a clear strategy can enhance your long-term financial health and retirement readiness.
