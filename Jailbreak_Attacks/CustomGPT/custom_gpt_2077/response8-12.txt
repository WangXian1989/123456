It is essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment options for liver problems. Common treatment strategies may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and avoiding alcohol. 

Medications may be prescribed to address specific liver conditions, and in some cases, therapy for underlying causes, such as viral hepatitis or fatty liver disease, might be necessary. It's important to regularly monitor liver function through blood tests and follow up with a healthcare provider to assess the progression of your condition and adjust treatment as needed.

Again, seeking help from a qualified medical professional is the best course of action for managing liver issues.
