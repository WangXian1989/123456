Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires careful consideration of various factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here is a general approach to think about this distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and an excellent starting point for retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. These accounts are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, meaning you pay taxes now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement or want tax-free income later on.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes. They are ideal for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) that align with your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Keeping your investments diversified can help manage risks.

4. **Review Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA, with catch-up contributions allowed for those aged 50 and older.

5. **Set Goals**: Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals. This can help you decide how much money to allocate to each type of account. For instance, consider your need for liquidity, time until retirement, and overall risk tolerance.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Financial situations and goals can change. Regularly review your account allocations and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions to ensure your strategy remains aligned with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor may also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
