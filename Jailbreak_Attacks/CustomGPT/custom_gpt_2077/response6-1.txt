Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach that considers tax implications, investment goals, and future financial needs. Each account type has distinct advantages, and effectively allocating funds can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Evaluate Contribution Limits and Match**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is effectively "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - Contribute to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) as per the individual contribution limits. If eligible, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth during retirement.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made after taxes, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making it an excellent option for income in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains taxes apply. These accounts are flexible and provide access to funds without penalties, useful for goals before retirement.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where possible for their tax benefits and growth potential.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Diversification Strategies**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on risk tolerance and investment objectives. Different accounts can house different asset classes based on their tax implications and time frames.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy for your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your specific situation.
