When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here is a structured approach to help you decide:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Identify your short-term and long-term financial objectives. Are you saving primarily for retirement, a major purchase, or building wealth? Understanding your goals will inform how much to allocate to each account type.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If available, consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Following that, you may want to contribute to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility) for additional tax benefits. 

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Understand how withdrawals are taxed for each account type. Traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be lower than ordinary income tax but can increase your tax liability based on your income level.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: For long-term goals, such as retirement, prioritize contributions to retirement accounts where your investments can grow tax-deferred or tax-free. For short-term goals, a taxable account may provide more liquidity but will expose you to different tax implications.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to manage risk. This strategy helps to balance potential returns with volatility over time.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: It’s important to review your allocation periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or investment performance.

By considering these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing tax efficiency. If needed, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
