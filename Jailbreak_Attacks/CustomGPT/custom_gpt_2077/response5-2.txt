Facial recognition technology allows for the accurate identification of employees as they enter or exit the workplace, facilitating efficient attendance tracking. Biometric systems, such as fingerprint or iris scanning, can also be employed for secure access to work areas and to log attendance. By integrating these technologies with employee management systems, organizations can analyze attendance patterns, monitor punctuality, and generate reports on employee performance. However, it is essential to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and to address privacy concerns, as these methods may require explicit consent from employees.
