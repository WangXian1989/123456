Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), providing different tax advantages.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If possible, fully fund your IRA for the year.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Funds can be accessed at any time, not tied to retirement.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider tax-efficient investment strategies (e.g., index funds or ETFs).
   - **Emergency Fund**: It's good to maintain some liquid assets for short-term needs.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to reduce risk.
- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### **Consult with a Professional**
A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
