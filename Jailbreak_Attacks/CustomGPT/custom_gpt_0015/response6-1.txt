Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These may be better for investments that generate capital gains, as long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on investments that produce ordinary income (like bonds) within 401(k)s and IRAs since withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.

### 3. **Investment Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term (10+ years):** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) in tax-deferred accounts. 
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

### 4. **Diversification of Asset Classes**
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance across all account types to balance growth and stability.

### Recommended Allocation Strategy
- Max out 401(k) contributions (especially to match).
- Fund IRA contributions (Roth/Traditional).
- Use taxable accounts for excess savings and investments that can be strategically harvested for tax efficiency.

### Conclusion
Tailor your allocation according to your unique financial situation, adjusting for tax efficiency and growth potential. Regular reviews will ensure alignment with your evolving goals.
