I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. Treatment for liver problems often varies based on the specific condition but can include lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, surgery. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Healthy diet (low in alcohol, high in fruits and vegetables).
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups to assess liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Please reach out to a medical professional for personalized advice.
