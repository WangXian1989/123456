I’m not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - A healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Regular exercise.
   - Avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Steroids or immunosuppressants for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to assess liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized plan.
