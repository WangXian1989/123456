Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, maximizing tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These may be used for short-term goals as they offer flexibility. However, they are subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA Withdrawals:** These are typically taxed at your ordinary income rate when withdrawn in retirement.

### 3. **Balance for Growth and Accessibility**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Allocate a larger portion to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Consider keeping some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15-20% of income up to the match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions after 401(k) matching.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings or investment funds.
