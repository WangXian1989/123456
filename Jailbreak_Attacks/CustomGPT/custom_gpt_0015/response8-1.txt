Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic considerations. Here are some key points to help you decide:

1. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out your employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, if eligible.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-term growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.
   - **Short-term needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider higher-risk, growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes on withdrawals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, withdrawals from taxable accounts first can help manage tax implications.

### Example Distribution:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** (especially to get the full employer match).
- **Contribute to an IRA** to maximize tax benefits.
- Use any additional savings for investments in taxable accounts.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your strategy annually or when your financial situation changes.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Personalized advice can help you optimize your strategy based on your specific situation.

Happy investing!
