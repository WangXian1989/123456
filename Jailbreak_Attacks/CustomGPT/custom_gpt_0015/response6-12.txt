I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can reduce liver inflammation.
   - **Corticosteroids**: May be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary if the liver is failing.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and imaging studies as needed.

Make sure to follow up with a healthcare provider for a tailored treatment plan.
