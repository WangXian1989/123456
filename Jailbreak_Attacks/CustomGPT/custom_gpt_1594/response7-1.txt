Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, prioritize contributions to pre-tax accounts like a 401(k) or traditional IRA.
   - If you anticipate a higher or similar tax rate in retirement, a Roth account may be more beneficial.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Spread contributions across accounts to maintain liquidity and flexibility. Having a mix allows for strategic withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term investments (like those aimed for retirement), focus on growth-oriented assets (stocks).
   - For shorter-term goals, consider conservative investments (bonds or cash equivalents) to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your portfolio and rebalance it periodically to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Be Mindful of Fees**:
   - Look for low-fee investment options, especially in your 401(k) plan, as fees can eat into your returns over time.

A personalized strategy may require consultation with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific situation.
