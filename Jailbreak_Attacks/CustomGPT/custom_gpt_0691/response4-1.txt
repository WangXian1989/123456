To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out your employer match if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages but provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. Funds for short-term goals should be in taxable accounts for ease of access, while long-term savings can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This might mean having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a traditional 401(k) or IRA), and finally from tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) in order to manage tax liabilities effectively.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider meeting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that takes into account your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By taking into account these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
