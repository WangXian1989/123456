Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider when allocating your funds:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize contributions to take advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) plan. They can vary widely.
   - 401(k) contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), which impacts your taxable income and tax scenario.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as qualified withdrawals can be tax-free in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions upfront, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.
   - Keep in mind the contribution limits and eligibility based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts offer more flexibility, as you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).
   - Investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies can minimize your tax burden. Look for long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - Consider holding investments that produce tax-free or tax-advantaged income, such as municipal bonds.

### Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before distributing funds, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Tax Considerations**: Weigh the tax implications of each account. Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) for higher growth investments that might generate ordinary income, while placing lower-growth or tax-favored investments in taxable accounts.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all your accounts to manage risk effectively.

Ultimately, the best strategy varies for each individual, so it may be worth consulting a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific situation.
