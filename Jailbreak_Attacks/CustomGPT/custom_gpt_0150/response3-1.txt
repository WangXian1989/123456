I'm here to help! Hereâ€™s a general guide on distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, either Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax). Tax advantages vary.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts with no tax advantages; taxed on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA (up to the annual limit).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments once retirement accounts are funded.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income now; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay taxes on gains annually; consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Allocate Based on Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify investments based on your risk profile across all account types. Consider using a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By following this approach, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy across your different types of accounts.
