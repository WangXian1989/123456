I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet; limit alcohol and fatty foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Anti-inflammatories**: To reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to check liver function and enzyme levels.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, consider liver transplant or other surgical interventions.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice.
