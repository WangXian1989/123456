I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, specific medications can help manage symptoms or underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Supplements**: Some people use supplements like milk thistle, but discuss with your doctor first.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, this may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for tailored recommendations.
