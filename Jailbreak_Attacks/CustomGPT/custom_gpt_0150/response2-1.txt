To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing the maximum allowable limit, especially pre-tax contributions.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; otherwise, traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower capital gains tax (like index funds) or bonds.
   - Keep high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Adjust contributions based on your current and expected future tax rates.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to spread risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually to stay aligned with your financial goals.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain liquidity in a savings account before investing aggressively.

Each individual's situation varies, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
