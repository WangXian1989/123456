I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures or liver transplantation. The specific approach often depends on the type and severity of the liver condition. Always seek medical guidance for the best treatment tailored to your situation.
