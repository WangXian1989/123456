Certainly! Hereâ€™s a general strategy for distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
   - **Target Contribution Rate**: Aim for 10-15% of your income if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRA**: Choose based on your current tax bracket and retirement goals.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: For 2023, contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the next 5-10 years.
   - **Consider Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved before heavy investing.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments in each account type, considering risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your retirement goals.

By following this approach, you can balance tax advantages while still preparing for short-term needs. Adjust the percentages based on your financial situation and goals.
