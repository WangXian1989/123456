I'm here to help you with that! Here’s a general guideline on how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Plan**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Prioritize maxing out contributions if your budget allows.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can offer tax-free growth, making it a great option for long-term savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Contribute to a taxable account once you're at or near the limits of your 401(k) and IRA. This can be beneficial for liquidity needs or expenses planned before retirement.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for savings aimed at shorter timeframes (like a house down payment).
- **Long-term Growth**: Place your long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize compounding and tax benefits.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices across all accounts are well-diversified.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust allocations according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

It’s wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your specific situation.
