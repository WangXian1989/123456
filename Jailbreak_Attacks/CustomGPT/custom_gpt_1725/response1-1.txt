The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax and grow tax-deferred until retirement, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide flexibility and access to funds before retirement age without penalties. They are subject to capital gains tax, so consider using tax-efficient investment strategies here.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified based on your risk tolerance. Different accounts may have different investment options, and maintaining asset allocation across all accounts is crucial.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts for unexpected expenses.

5. **Long-Term Perspective**: Focus on long-term growth rather than short-term fluctuations, and periodically reassess your strategy.

It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances.
