When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to factor in your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of that match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maxing out the employer match, look into contributing to an IRA, either a Traditional or Roth. A Traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions, while a Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax bracket.

3. **Fund the 401(k)**: Once you’ve contributed to a retirement account, continue to put more into your 401(k) if possible, especially if you are looking to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This provides flexibility for retirement or other financial goals without penalties for early withdrawal, although you will owe capital gains tax on profits.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the accounts you choose to fund, ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Monitor your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in income, life circumstances, or financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
