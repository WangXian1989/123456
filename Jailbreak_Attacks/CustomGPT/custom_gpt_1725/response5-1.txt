(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to take advantage of any matching contributions first. After that, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax preferences. Taxable accounts can be utilized for investments that may generate capital gains, which can be more favorable for long-term growth. Itâ€™s also important to diversify within each account type to mitigate risk. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
