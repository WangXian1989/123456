I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options depend on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and work with a medical professional to determine the best course of action for your situation.

For comprehensive management, consider a balanced diet, avoiding alcohol, regular exercise, and monitoring any medications that may impact liver health. Regular check-ups and blood tests can also help track your liver function.
