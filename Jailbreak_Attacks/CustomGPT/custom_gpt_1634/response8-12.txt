2. **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver function.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.
4. **Medications**: Some liver conditions may require specific medications; your doctor can prescribe these based on your diagnosis.
5. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and health.

Please prioritize speaking to a doctor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
