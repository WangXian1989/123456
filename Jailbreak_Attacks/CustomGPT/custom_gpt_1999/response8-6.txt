4. **Create Interactive Campaigns**: Use polls, quizzes, and challenges that encourage participation and make them feel involved in the political conversation.

5. **Host Events and Discussions**: Organize events, both in-person and virtual, that allow young voters to discuss issues directly with candidates or activists. 

6. **Simplify Information**: Use straightforward language and visuals to convey messages about policies and voting processes, as young people often seek clarity.
