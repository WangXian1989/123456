Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Aim for a mix of account types:
   - Contribute to a Traditional 401(k) or Traditional IRA for the immediate tax deduction.
   - Allocate funds to a Roth IRA if you expect higher income in retirement or want tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If retirement is many years away, consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your taxable accounts, where you may pay capital gains taxes on profits. Shift to more conservative investments as you approach retirement.

5. **Taxable Account Utility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like municipal bonds) or for funds needed before retirement age without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Revisit your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized strategy from a professional can significantly enhance your investment outcomes based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines and adjusting based on your unique circumstances, you can create a balanced distribution strategy among your accounts.
