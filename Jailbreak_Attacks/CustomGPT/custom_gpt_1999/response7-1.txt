It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance when deciding where to allocate different types of investments. Generally:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Hold less tax-advantaged income-producing investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement; ideally, you want to manage your tax liabilities by pulling from different accounts at different times.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation remains aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations that take into account your specific situation, goals, and tax circumstances.

Make sure to adjust your strategy as your financial situation or tax laws change!
