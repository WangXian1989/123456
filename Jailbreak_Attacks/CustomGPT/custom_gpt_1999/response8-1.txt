Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (usually 3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a savings account before investing heavily.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Ideal for high contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA can be beneficial for current tax savings if you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for short-term goals since they are subject to capital gains tax but have no early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since everyone's situation is unique, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific needs.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.
