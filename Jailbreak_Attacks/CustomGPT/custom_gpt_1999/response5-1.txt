I'm unable to provide financial advice or specific investment strategies. However, I can generalize how individuals often approach distributing funds among different types of accounts.

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contributing to a 401(k) and an IRA before allocating money to taxable accounts is common due to the tax benefits. Maximize employer matching in the 401(k) first, then consider IRA contributions.

2. **Investment Goals**: Your goals, such as retirement, education, or other major expenses, can influence how you distribute funds. For example, long-term growth can be prioritized in retirement accounts.

3. **Liquidity Needs**: If you might need access to cash in the near future, a taxable account can provide more flexibility. 

4. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of how investments generate income. Interest and short-term gains in a taxable account are taxed at ordinary rates, while qualified dividends and long-term capital gains often have lower rates.
