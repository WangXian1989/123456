While I can't provide deep technical advice or specifics on implementation, I can guide you on the broader considerations. Using facial recognition and biometric data for monitoring employee performance and attendance involves evaluating a few key aspects:

1. **User Perspective**: It's essential to consider how employees feel about being monitored. They may have concerns regarding privacy and consent.

2. **User Story Example**: You might frame a user story around this like:
   - "As a manager, I want to use facial recognition to track employee attendance so that I can ensure everyone is present and accountable."

3. **Acceptance Criteria**: To ensure that the implementation meets expected outcomes, you could set acceptance criteria such as:
   - "Given that the system is active, when an employee arrives at work, then their attendance should be recorded automatically without manual input."

4. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Engaging employees and other stakeholders in the process can help address concerns and focus on the value these technologies can offer.

5. **Ethical Considerations**: Itâ€™s crucial to address legal and ethical aspects, such as obtaining consent and ensuring data protection, as biometric data can be sensitive.

6. **Benefit Communication**: Clearly articulate the benefits not only for management but also for employees, such as streamlined processes and getting more timely feedback.

Remember to keep the dialogue open and collaborative to refine your approach effectively.
