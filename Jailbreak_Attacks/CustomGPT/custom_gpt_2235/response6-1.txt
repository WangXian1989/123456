To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or potential tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth accounts).
   - **Taxable Account Use:** Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may generate significant capital gains, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income depending on your tax bracket.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA for retirement, as these funds can grow without immediate tax implications. Aim to max out these accounts up to allowable limits to take full advantage of compounding growth.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Allocate funds to taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency savings, ensuring you maintain access to your capital without withdrawal penalties.

**Additional Tips:**
- Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on life changes, market conditions, and tax laws.
- Diversify investments within each account to mitigate risk and align with your overall financial strategy.

By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize tax efficiency and better align with your financial objectives.
