Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Consider maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts. This can provide tax benefits that help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Often, your 401(k) will offer a selection of mutual funds or ETFs. Choose a diversified mix that aligns with your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **IRA**: An IRA typically offers a broader range of investment options. You might consider using it for more aggressive investments if it's a traditional IRA or tax-efficient investments if it's a Roth IRA, as they grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: For these, focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Bonds may not be ideal for taxable accounts due to their tax implications.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts (like a traditional IRA and 401(k)) are taxed as ordinary income, whereas Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Be strategic about where to hold different types of investments based on their tax treatment.

5. **Adjust for Time Horizon**:
   - If you are far from retirement, consider a growth-oriented strategy, especially in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you approach retirement, start shifting to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Your investment needs may change over time, so review your distribution strategy regularly and rebalance your portfolio as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure of the best approach for your specific situation, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, so tailor your approach accordingly.
