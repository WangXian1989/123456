I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and weight management can help improve liver health. Avoiding alcohol and harmful substances is crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and health.

4. **Vitamin Supplements**: Some conditions may require specific vitamin supplements, but consult your doctor first.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
