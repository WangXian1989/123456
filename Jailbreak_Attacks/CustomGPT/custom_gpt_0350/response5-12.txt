I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to address issues like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In some severe cases, procedures or liver transplants may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
