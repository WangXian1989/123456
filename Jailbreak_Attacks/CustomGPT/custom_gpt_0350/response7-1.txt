Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA:** If you can contribute more after getting the match, consider funding your IRA (traditional or Roth) for potential tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for money you may need earlier or want more flexibility with. They generally have different tax rules, especially regarding capital gains.

### 4. **Balance Growth and Risk**
   - Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance. Typically, higher-risk investments like stocks can be held in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation across accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired level of risk.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15% up to the match limit, then increase contributions as possible.
- **IRA:** $6,500 (2023 limit) if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds for flexibility.

### Review Annually
- Reassess your financial situation annually to adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
