Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax situation. 
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial, as you pay taxes on contributions now and can withdraw funds tax-free in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Taxable accounts (like brokerage accounts) can be an important part of your overall strategy, especially for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) where they can grow without incurring taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk and take advantage of potential growth.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize your overall tax burden.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and circumstances.
