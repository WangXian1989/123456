To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions up to the annual limit if possible, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income level, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Funds in 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw them. Therefore, consider putting assets that are expected to grow the most (such as stocks) in these accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - In taxable accounts, be mindful of capital gains taxes. Holding investments for over a year can qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, that generate less taxable income.

4. **Consider Withdrawals and Accessibility:**
   - Money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them ideal for shorter-term needs. Plan for emergencies or big purchases using these funds.
   - Both 401(k) and IRA accounts have penalties for early withdrawals. Make sure you have sufficient funds in your taxable account for any immediate financial needs.

5. **Continually Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile and investment goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Depending on your financial situation, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy for your specific needs.

By applying these strategies, you’ll make the most of the tax advantages available while ensuring that your investments are working effectively for your long-term financial goals.
