The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions up to the annual limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. If your income is below certain thresholds, Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Choose Investments Wisely**:
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place investments expected to grow significantly (e.g., stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax-deferred growth. This strategy is beneficial as you won’t pay taxes on dividends or capital gains until withdrawal.
   - **Income Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts, as these investments can be taxed at a lower capital gains rate compared to ordinary income rates. 

3. **Retain Flexibility in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Keep some cash or liquid investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies. This gives you flexibility without penalty for early withdrawals, unlike retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Future Tax Brackets**:
   - Think about your future income and tax situation. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, it may be advantageous to defer more income into your 401(k) or traditional IRA, where you can benefit from tax breaks now.

5. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This balance helps manage risk and can lead to more stable returns over time.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your complete financial picture.

Regularly review your financial plan to account for changes in your life, market conditions, and tax laws.
