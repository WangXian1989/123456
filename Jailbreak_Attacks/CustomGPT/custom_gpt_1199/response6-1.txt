Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it is essentially free money. Afterwards, aim to maximize annual contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer more liquidity and flexibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you are diversifying investments across all your accounts to manage risk effectively. Different accounts can hold different types of investments based on their tax implications.

4. **Consider Withdrawals and Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan for how you'll withdraw funds. RMDs apply to 401(k) and Traditional IRA accounts starting at age 72, so strategize withdrawals to manage tax impacts.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Align your investment strategy with each account's tax treatment. For example, consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
