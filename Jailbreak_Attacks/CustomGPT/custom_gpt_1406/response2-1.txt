Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to start.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA. These accounts provide either tax-deferred growth (401(k) and traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing. Aim for 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a liquid savings account.

4. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing 401(k) contributions (especially if you can get the match), consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may qualify for a Roth IRA which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you maximize retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties (though you will pay capital gains taxes).

6. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Review Tax Implications**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawing from different accounts. Taxable gains can be lower on long-term investments compared to short-term gains.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max contributions up to employer match.
- **IRA**: Max contributions (consider a Roth if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

Adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and life events. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your goals.
