Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a structured approach to help you make an informed decision:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: A tax-advantaged retirement account usually offered by employers. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Another tax-advantaged account, which can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax contributions). Limits on contributions are lower compared to 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Non-retirement investment accounts that don't benefit from tax advantages. Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they're realized.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. For retirement savings, prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - Consider your liquidity needs – taxable accounts can be accessed more easily without penalties.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially “free” money.

### 4. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After obtaining the 401(k) match, prioritize maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth based on your eligibility and tax situation).
   - Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 5. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This provides more flexibility and liquidity.

### 6. **Diversification & Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) may differ between accounts based on their tax implications.
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and fixed-income investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liability.

### 7. **Regular Review & Rebalance**:
   - Review your investments periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.
   - Rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation. 

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you need personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to help you navigate complex tax implications and investment strategies.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions to the match limit.
- Depending on your income, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA.
- Allocate any additional savings to a taxable account for short-term needs or further investments.

### Conclusion:
The best way to distribute your money depends on your specific financial situation, investment goals, and the tax environment. By prioritizing tax-advantaged options first and considering your access to funds, you can create a balanced investment strategy that supports your financial objectives.

### Final Tip:
Stay informed about changes in tax laws and retirement account limits, as they can influence your investment strategy over time.
