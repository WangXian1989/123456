To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Benefits**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Taxation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year. These accounts are ideal for long-term growth as you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. They can provide flexibility for withdrawal without penalties, making them useful for financial emergencies.

3. **Prioritize Contributions by Account Type**:
   - After contributing enough to qualify for the 401(k) match, consider maxing out an IRA if you prefer tax-advantaged growth. The annual contribution limits are lower compared to 401(k)s.
   - After reaching these limits, continue contributing to your 401(k) to take advantage of higher contribution limits.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Choose a diversified mix of assets in each account type to best align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Consider placing higher-growth, riskier investments in the tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on potential gains, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments that generate regular income (like bonds).

5. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation or retirement goals. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help create a strategic plan that considers your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications.

Overall, the key is to use tax-advantaged accounts effectively while maintaining liquidity and flexibility with your taxable accounts.
