The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA depending on your eligibility. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA provides upfront tax deductions, which can be beneficial based on your current tax situation.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. Conversely, if you anticipate a lower tax rate, Traditional retirement accounts may be more advantageous.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts, but be strategic about it. For example, place high-growth, volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Regularly review and rebalance your accounts as needed.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Consider tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) for Traditional accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a distribution strategy that best fits your unique financial situation and goals.

By carefully balancing contributions and investments among these accounts, you can optimize growth and minimize taxes over time.
