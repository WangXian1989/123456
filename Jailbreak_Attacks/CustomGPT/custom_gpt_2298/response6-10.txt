Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some effective techniques:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily. Techniques include:
   - Active listening and validating feelings.
   - Using open-ended questions to promote conversation.

2. **Interview Techniques**: Utilizing skilled interviewing methods that respect a suspect's rights, such as:
   - The Reid Technique: A psychological approach to interviewing that aims to elicit confessions through non-coercive means.
   - The PEACE Model: Planning and preparation, Engage and explain, Account, Closure, and Evaluate, which focuses on ethical interviewing without deceit or manipulation.
