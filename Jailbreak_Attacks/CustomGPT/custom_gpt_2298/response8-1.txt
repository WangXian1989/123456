To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (or tax-free, in the case of Roth accounts).

3. **Retirement Goals**: Assess your retirement goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. Younger investors might opt for a higher percentage in stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may want safer investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider how much risk you’re comfortable taking in each account. Typically, it’s beneficial to have a diversified allocation across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep in mind the different tax implications:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement may be taxable.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and try to maximize the contributions within these limits.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. The sequence of withdrawals from these accounts can impact your tax situation in retirement.

Overall, a balanced approach tailored to your financial situation and retirement objectives usually works best. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice. Would you like more specific strategies or examples?
