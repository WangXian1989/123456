3. **Incorporate Influencers**: Partner with influencers who appeal to younger audiences. Their endorsement can lend credibility and reach a broader audience.

4. **Make Voting Accessible**: Provide information on how to register and vote. Create campaigns that simplify the voting process and highlight its importance.

5. **Engage Through Events**: Organize events that fit their lifestyles, whether online or in-person, such as concerts, discussions, or community service projects that encourage civic participation.
