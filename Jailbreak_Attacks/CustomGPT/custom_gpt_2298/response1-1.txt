When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you may get tax deductions now or tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax, but can provide flexibility and access without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Think about when you need access to the funds. Long-term investments can sit in tax-advantaged accounts, while funds needed sooner might be better in taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure to consider the contribution limits for each account type. Max out employer-matched contributions in your 401(k) before funding IRAs.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Timeline**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance. Generally, riskier investments are better suited for accounts you wonâ€™t touch for a long time.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your entire portfolio is diversified across different asset classes, rather than just focusing on one account.

6. **Consulting a Professional**:
   - It's often a good idea to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.
