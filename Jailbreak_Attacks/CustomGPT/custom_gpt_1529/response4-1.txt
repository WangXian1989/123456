The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and up to $6,500 to a traditional or Roth IRA (or $7,500 if you're over 50). These accounts grow tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth), which can greatly enhance growth over time.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider allocating additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments for profit.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. For retirement accounts, a long-term growth focus with stocks might be appropriate, while taxable accounts could include a mix of stocks and more liquid assets for short-term needs.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Generally, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that suits your individual circumstance, especially to understand the tax implications and adjust for any changes in income or financial goals.

Remember, the best strategy is highly individual, so personal circumstances will dictate the most effective distribution.
