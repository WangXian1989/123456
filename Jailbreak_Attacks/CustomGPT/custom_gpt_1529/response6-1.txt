Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering factors such as tax implications, growth potential, and your individual financial goals. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match - this is essentially free money. Depending on your tax bracket, consider contributing the maximum allowable to take full advantage of tax deferment.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for additional tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your future tax outlook.

2. **Assess Your Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest surplus funds in taxable accounts. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - Consider using tax-loss harvesting strategies within your taxable account to offset gains and mitigate tax burdens.

3. **Monitor Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments within each account based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and market conditions. Stocks, bonds, and alternative investments can be adjusted accordingly.
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market developments.

By following these strategies, you'll be optimizing your savings and investments across all three account types for long-term financial growth. Always consult a financial advisor tailored to your unique situation for personalized advice.
