When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan and matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if you can, as these accounts provide tax advantages.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider putting money into a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you choose a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free. If eligible, try to max out your IRA contributions as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This is more flexible, as you can access your funds without penalties (unlike early withdrawals from retirement accounts). However, be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

**General Recommendations**:
- **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Think about your current and future tax situation. Contributing to tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Liquidity Needs**: If you might need access to your cash soon, keep some funds in a taxable account to avoid penalties for early withdrawals. 

Remember to assess your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals to tailor this strategy to your needs. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.
