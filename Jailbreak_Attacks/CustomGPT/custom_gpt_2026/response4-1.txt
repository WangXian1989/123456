Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Fill your 401(k) up to the employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now; taxes are due on withdrawals.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars but allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here could be subject to capital gains tax upon selling.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Generally, keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) due to potential for higher returns and tax implications.
   - Consider more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you may need the money sooner, keep more in taxable accounts since they offer more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Balance**:
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Adjust your strategy as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs.
