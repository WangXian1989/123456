Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to get the match, then consider contributing up to the limit if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to the above accounts, focus on taxable accounts for more flexibility and access to funds before retirement.

4. **Investing Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Often benefit from long-term, higher-risk investments since penalties apply on withdrawals before age 59Â½.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice tailored to your situation can be extremely beneficial.

Always consider your specific circumstances and consult a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your needs!
