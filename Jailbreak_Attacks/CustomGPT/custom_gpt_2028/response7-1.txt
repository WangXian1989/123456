To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Alternatively, evaluate a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might have a lower tax burden, like index funds or municipal bonds.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Focus on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) with strategies like stocks and ETFs.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments and those you may want to access sooner.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. 

5. **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This strategy maximizes tax benefits while allowing flexibility in your investment choices.
