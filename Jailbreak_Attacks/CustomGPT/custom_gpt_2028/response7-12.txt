I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver issues, depending on the condition. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage the disease or relieve symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and progression.

4. **Nutritional Support**: Consulting a nutritionist for personalized dietary plans.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition.
