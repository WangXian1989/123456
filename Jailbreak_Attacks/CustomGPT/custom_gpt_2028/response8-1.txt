Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out your contributions (up to the limit based on your age).
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient savings in a high-yield savings account for emergencies apart from your investment accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Utilize these for shorter-term goals or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and reward.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
