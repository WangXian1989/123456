To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider a few key factors including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to help you plan:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing any matching contributions, direct additional funds into a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can substantially benefit your retirement savings over time.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your current taxable income. However, distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions; however, Roth IRAs enable tax-free withdrawals in retirement but do not provide an upfront tax break.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they do not provide tax deductions or tax-free growth, they offer more flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Your investment strategy will also influence how you distribute funds:
   - Consider holding more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: As market conditions and your financial situation change, regularly review and adjust your distribution and allocations to ensure they remain aligned with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the optimal distribution strategies based on your unique situation, consider seeking advice from a financial planner who can provide personalized recommendations.

By following these principles, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money that maximizes growth potential and minimizes tax liabilities over time.
