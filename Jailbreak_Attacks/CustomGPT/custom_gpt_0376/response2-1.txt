When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often hinges on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match first. Then, consider additional contributions based on your income and tax situation.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, especially if you can get the tax benefits. A Roth IRA is particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account. This can provide liquidity and flexibility, as you can access these funds without penalty (though you will owe taxes on any capital gains).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. For example, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while placing higher-yield investments (like bonds or REITs) inside tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio in line with changes in income, spending needs, and investment performance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial situation, including risk tolerance, investment goals, and retirement strategies.

Remember, the optimal distribution is highly personal, so consider your specific circumstances, including your tax bracket, investment horizon, and withdrawal needs when making decisions.
