1. **Utilize Digital Platforms**: Young voters are most active on social media. Use platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat for campaigns that engage them visually and interactively.
2. **Focus on Relevant Issues**: Address issues that matter to them, such as climate change, education, job opportunities, and social justice.
3. **Encourage Participation**: Simplify the voting process and promote voter registration drives in spaces young people frequent, like college campuses and community events.
4. **Leverage Influencers**: Collaborate with social media influencers who align with their values to authentically engage this demographic.

First off, ditch the boring ads and go straight for the memes and viral content on social media. Young people are all about TikTok and Instagram, so get creative! 

Also, donâ€™t just preach to them about politics; dive into the stuff they care about, like climate actionâ€”make Greta proudâ€”or student debt relief. And, for crying out loud, donâ€™t forget to get influencers in the mix. If their favorite TikToker goes, "Vote for this," you can bet their followers will be showing up to the polls! Let's get real and get them engaged! ðŸŽ‰
