I'm not a doctor, but here are some general suggestions that you could discuss with a healthcare professional regarding liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** Emphasizing a balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol:** Completely abstaining from alcohol is crucial if liver health is compromised.

2. **Medical Treatments:**
   - **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, there may be medications available to help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
   - **Regular Monitoring:** Keeping up with regular check-ups can help track liver function and adjust treatments as necessary.

3. **Alternative Therapies:**
   - **Supplements:** Some may find benefits in certain liver-supportive supplements, though these should be taken under guidance.
   - **Herbal Remedies:** Popular remedies include milk thistle and dandelion root, but these should also be approached with caution.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment options specific to your health needs.
