To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Fund IRA Accounts**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax benefits (deductions for Traditional, tax-free growth for Roth) can significantly enhance your savings.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. This gives you more liquidity and flexibility for shorter-term goals.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on higher-growth investments like stocks, which can benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments or those that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Be Mindful of Tax Implications**: Keep track of your overall asset allocation. Generally, it's wise to hold tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

7. **Consider Retirement Timeline**: Your age and retirement goals can dictate the balance. Younger investors may favor growth, whereas those closer to retirement may focus on stability and income.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This strategy can help you optimize growth, manage taxes efficiently, and align your investments with your long-term goals.
