To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider the tax implications of traditional vs. Roth contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Aim to max out contributions annually. If eligible, the Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Use index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover rates to minimize capital gains taxes. 
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains by selling losing investments strategically.

### 3. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Place Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Interest from bonds is taxed at ordinary income rates, so hold them in accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.
   - **Allocate Stocks to Taxable Accounts**: Long-term capital gains rates are lower than ordinary income rates, making stocks preferable in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and market conditions, ensuring alignment with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions** to 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages.
- **Use taxable accounts** for investments that are lower in capital gains tax implications.
- **Implement rebalancing** to maintain desired asset allocation.

By following these strategies, you can improve your potential for growth while managing taxation effectively. Adjust these general guidelines based on your personal financial situation and goals.
