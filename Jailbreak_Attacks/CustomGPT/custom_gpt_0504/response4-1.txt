Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment preferences. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and the account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Investments can be withdrawn at any time without penalties, but capital gains tax applies on profits.
   - **Tax Planning**: Useful for funds needed before retirement or for goals like buying a home.

### General Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)** up to the employer match.
- **Maximize IRA contributions** next, depending on your tax strategy (Traditional vs. Roth).
- **Fill any remaining investment goals** with taxable accounts. 

### Suggested Distribution:
- Allocate your contributions based on tax consequences, growth potential, and liquidity needs. For example:
  - If you’re younger and expect to increase your tax bracket, prioritize Roth IRAs.
  - If you’re closer to retirement, you may want to lean towards maxing out traditional accounts for immediate tax benefits.

### Review Regularly:
- Adjust contributions annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
