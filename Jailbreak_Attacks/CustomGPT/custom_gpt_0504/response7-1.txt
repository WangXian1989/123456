Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Future Tax Planning:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected future tax situation.
   - **Maximize Limits:** Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA as well if you can afford it.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds, as they provide more flexibility for withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds and strategies, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Recommended Distribution Approach:
- **Prioritize 401(k) contributions** up to the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** to take advantage of tax benefits depending on your situation.
- **Use taxable accounts** for any additional savings or investments, focusing on liquidity and tax efficiency.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income
- **IRA:** 10% of income
- **Taxable Accounts:** 5% of income

Adjust this based on your specific goals and financial situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
