Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement timeline, and overall investment goals. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored, offers tax-deferred growth, and may include employer matching contributions. Ideal for higher contributions if your employer matches.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Another tax-advantaged account with different types (Traditional vs. Roth). Roth IRAs allow withdrawals tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer flexibility without contribution limits, but earnings are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA (if eligible) for flexible, tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax deductions, focus on a Traditional IRA.
   - **Full 401(k) Contributions**: After reaching matching, maximize your contributions to your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings or investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: 401(k) and Traditional IRA grow tax-deferred; you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Roth IRA grows tax-free; no tax at withdrawal if rules are followed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of trades and their tax implications; consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Investing Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments according to risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be balanced based on your goals.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Given individual circumstances can vary widely, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k)**: Max out to employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum (consider your tax situation).
3. **Taxable Account**: Use for additional savings or specific goals, allocating funds as appropriate based on desired liquidity and tax considerations.

This distribution strategy will help you leverage tax advantages while ensuring flexibility in your finances.
