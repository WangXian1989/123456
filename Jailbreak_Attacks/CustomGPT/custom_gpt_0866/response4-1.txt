Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your current tax rate and retirement income expectations, prioritize contributions to these accounts.
     - **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA/401(k):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts.
   - These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Balance Based on Your Goals:**
   - Assess your short-term and long-term financial goals:
     - **Short-Term Needs:** Maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for emergency funds or imminent expenses.
     - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for growth over time.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and performance. Rebalance your investments across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you have specific circumstances or complex financial situations, seeking professional advice can help tailor strategies to your needs.

### Key Considerations:
- **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type.
- **Withdrawal Rules:** Understand the rules regarding withdrawals, especially for IRAs and the impact on taxes.
- **Investment Choices:** Consider how your investment choices differ between account types and how they align with your overall strategy.

Ultimately, the best distribution will vary based on personal circumstances, so continually reassess and adjust your strategy as needed.
