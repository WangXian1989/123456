Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### General Guidelines for Distribution

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Be mindful of the contribution limits.
   - **Investment Choices**: Review the investment options within your plan for growth potential.

2. **Individual Retirement Account (IRA)**:
   - **Choose the Right Type**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay within the contribution limits and consider funding a Roth if you qualify, as it can provide tax diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer the greatest flexibility for withdrawals and investments. They're useful for long-term goals that don’t fit into retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Considerations for Allocation

- **Emergency Fund**: Keep an emergency fund in a savings account that covers 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might prioritize growth in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement might focus on preserving capital.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

### Example Strategy
- **40% in 401(k)**: Max out employer match and contribute a substantial amount for tax benefits.
- **30% in IRA**: Prioritize funding a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA based on your current tax bracket.
- **30% in Taxable Account**: Use for shorter-term goals or as a place to invest after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Final Advice
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.
