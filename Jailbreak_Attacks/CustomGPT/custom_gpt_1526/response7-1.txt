Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies for optimal distribution:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to maximize that benefit. It’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), it reduces your taxable income now, which is advantageous if you’re in a higher tax bracket. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later or value tax-free income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more access to your funds without penalty, unlike retirement accounts. They’re great for short-term savings or if you need funds before retirement age.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax. Consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Practical Tips:
- **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure a diversified investment mix aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **Regularly Reassess**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changing life circumstances, market performance, and tax laws.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation, ensuring you optimize tax implications and investment growth.
