To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, growing tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, either deductible (traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility and liquidity for investments.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax reductions.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks tend to perform well over the long term, while bonds may provide stability.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to shield them from taxes. Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or qualified dividends).

6. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity outside retirement accounts for emergencies, typically 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, your life changes, or shifts in market conditions.

8. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

It's essential to maintain a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals while optimizing tax efficiency.
