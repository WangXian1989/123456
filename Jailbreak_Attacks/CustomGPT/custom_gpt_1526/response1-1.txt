Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to capture the full benefit. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Consider using a mix of a Traditional and Roth IRA, if eligible, to balance future tax liabilities.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Useful for goals outside retirement, such as buying a home or travel.
   - **Investments**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatments, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize 401(k)**: At least contribute enough to get any employer match.
- **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you can, fully fund your IRA next, prioritizing Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
- **Contribute to Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, funnel any extra savings into taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Regular Review:
- **Rebalance Portfolio**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

### Consider Your Goals:
- Align your investment strategy with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and when you plan to retire. 

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
