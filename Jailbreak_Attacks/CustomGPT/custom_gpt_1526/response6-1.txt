To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with a matching contribution; offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Individual retirement accounts allowing tax-advantaged growth; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals but taxed on capital gains; no tax advantages.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer matching contributions** in your 401(k) first; this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider your tax bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA might provide immediate tax benefits. A Roth IRA can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher bracket during retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate investments across different accounts to manage risk. For instance, you might hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates and put more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - Maintain a portion of funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and quick access if needed, while maximizing growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

By strategically allocating your funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax efficiency while working towards your long-term financial goals.
