Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). 
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and potential eligibility for Roth IRA based on your income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties, making them useful for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of how investments are taxed; long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Prioritize Accounts**: Start with contributions to the 401(k) to capitalize on matching, then fund an IRA. After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments across accounts considering their tax implications. For example, hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while placing tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your income, expenses, and market conditions. Adjust as necessary to meet your long-term goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
