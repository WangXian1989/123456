Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines to help you optimize your distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows for pre-tax contributions, which may lower your current tax bill.

3. **Continue Contributing to Your 401(k)**: If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This reduces your taxable income and allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide flexibility, especially if you may need to access funds before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor the investment strategy for each account based on its tax implications:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Focus on growth-oriented investments, like stocks or mutual funds, since they can benefit more from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

7. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax rates when deciding between tax-deferred and taxable accounts. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

8. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity outside investments for emergencies, which helps avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts prematurely.
