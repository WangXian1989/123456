When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to assess your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for future tax-free withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: Once you've funded your IRA, focus on maximizing your contributions to your 401(k). This will also give you tax deferral on your contributions, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can then turn your attention to taxable investment accounts. These accounts can offer more liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes on realized earnings.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Within each type of account, consider how you allocate investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. You may want to be more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts since the tax impact is deferred until withdrawal (or in the case of Roth, potentially permanently).

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
