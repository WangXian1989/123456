Î± The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs (Traditional or Roth depending on your eligibility and preferences) after capturing the employer match in your 401(k). This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility, especially for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across these accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market conditions.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your unique situation.
