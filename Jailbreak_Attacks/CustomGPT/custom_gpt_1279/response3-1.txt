Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: A retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. Contributions are often pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Personal retirement accounts that can be either traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (after-tax contributions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where earnings are subject to capital gains taxes and interest income.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (whether traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
   - After maxing out the IRA, allocate additional funds to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - High-income years might warrant more contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA to benefit from tax deductions.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts where withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Diversify Accounts for Flexibility**: Maintaining a mix of account types (taxed and tax-free) can help manage your tax burden in retirement. Having taxable accounts can also provide liquidity in case you need funds before retirement age without penalties.

6. **Rebalance as Necessary**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you are uncertain about the best strategy, consider consulting with a financial planner who can help tailor a plan for your specific circumstances.

By strategically distributing your contributions among these accounts, you can optimize your tax benefits and help ensure financial stability in retirement.
