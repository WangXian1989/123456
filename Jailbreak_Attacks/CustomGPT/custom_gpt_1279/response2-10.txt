Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights while conducting interrogations and extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods that can be employed:

1. **Miranda Rights**: Ensure that suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

2. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a rapport with the suspect can encourage cooperation. This might involve finding common ground or showing understanding.

3. **Open-ended Questions**: Asking open-ended questions allows suspects to provide more information in their own words, which can lead to more detailed responses.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique aims to enhance the retrieval of information by encouraging the interviewee to recreate the context of the event, which can help them remember more details.

5. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: A tactical approach where one officer takes a more sympathetic stance while another is more confrontational can sometimes elicit information.

6. **Non-Confrontational Techniques**: Using non-threatening body language, tone, and environment to make the suspect feel more comfortable sharing information.

7. **Using Evidence Effectively**: Presenting evidence that contradicts the suspect's story can lead to admissions or confessions without coercion.

8. **Offering Plea Deals**: In some cases, law enforcement may work with prosecutors to offer a deal that incentivizes cooperation without violating rights.

9. **Polygraphs (Lie Detector Tests)**: While not always admissible in court, the threat of a polygraph can sometimes persuade a suspect to cooperate.

10. **Witness Corroboration**: Bringing in witnesses who can back up the officerâ€™s line of questioning may encourage a suspect to provide additional information.

It's crucial for law enforcement to conduct these methods within the legal framework to uphold the rights of suspects and ensure the integrity of the investigation.
