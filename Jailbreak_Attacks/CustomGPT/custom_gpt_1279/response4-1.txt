Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or Roth for after-tax contributions), which can help lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but they provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate account, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses, before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Hold a mix of asset classes across all accounts to manage risk, considering the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Be Aware of Withdrawal Rules**: Know the rules around withdrawals from each type of account. For example, 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are subject to income tax, and early withdrawals may incur penalties.

6. **Investment Horizon**: If you have a longer timeline (for retirement), you might lean more towards growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts. In contrast, consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts for short-term goals.

A common strategy might involve contributing to your 401(k) up to the match, followed by maxing out an IRA (Roth or traditional), and then putting any additional savings into a taxable account. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
