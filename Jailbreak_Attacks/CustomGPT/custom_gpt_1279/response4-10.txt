Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some common techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques:**
   - **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** This encourages suspects to provide more information voluntarily.
   - **Building Rapport:** Establishing a connection with the suspect can lead to more cooperative behavior.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** This technique involves creating a relaxed environment, allowing the suspect to recount events in their own words, which can yield more accurate information.

2. **Use of Counsel:** 
   - Law enforcement must inform suspects of their right to an attorney. If a suspect requests an attorney, questioning must cease until the attorney is present.

3. **Miranda Rights:** 
   - Before conducting a custodial interrogation, officers must inform suspects of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

4. **Voluntary Confession:** 
   - Officers can encourage suspects to provide information voluntarily without coercion. This includes providing assurances of safety or confidentiality.

5. **Psychological Techniques:**
   - Understanding psychological principles, such as the use of techniques that appeal to a suspect's emotions or sense of morality, can also be effective.

6. **Evidence-Based Questioning:** 
   - Presenting suspects with evidence that contradicts their narrative can lead to admissions. Care must be taken to ensure this is done legally and ethically.

7. **Using Surveillance and Interrogation Technology:** 
   - Tools like body cameras and audio recorders can be used to ensure that interrogations are conducted within legal guidelines.

These methods aim to elicit information without violating the suspect's constitutional rights, ensuring that any information obtained can be used legally in court proceedings.
