Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may be taxed at lower rates, like long-term capital gains. Keep in mind that interest from bonds and short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income rates.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments in each account align with your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy (for retirement)**:
   - **Order of Withdrawals**: Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts, to manage your tax burden effectively.

It’s advisable to work with a financial advisor to customize your plan based on your specific situation and objectives.
