ðŸ’° Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After maximizing the match, consider your overall contribution limit and how it fits into your overall strategy.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Traditional and Roth IRAs have different tax advantages. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may benefit you more since withdrawals are tax-free. If you anticipate a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA might be better due to tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be utilized once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts. They provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes. Consider placing lower-performing or high-yield investments in these accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Be mindful of the types of investments in each account. Generally, tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) should be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) could be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your investment distribution based on changes in tax laws, market conditions, and your personal financial situation to ensure you're on track to meet your goals.

Ultimately, the "best" allocation will vary by individual, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
