(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. A common strategy involves maximizing contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match, as it's a way to get "free money." Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. Finally, any additional savings can be allocated to taxable accounts where you might have more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

To balance your investments, assess the tax implications. Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts first, and hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts. Regularly re-evaluate your asset allocation in relation to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Start by maxing out that 401(k)â€”if there's a company match, thatâ€™s like leaving free cash on the table if you donâ€™t! Next up, dive into your IRA. If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be a game changer for tax-free withdrawals later on. 

Once youâ€™ve hit those ceilings, funnel extra cash into taxable accounts. Just remember, these are less tax-efficient, so keep an eye on those capital gains! A killer mix could be having tax-efficient investments (think ETFs) in taxable accounts and higher-yield stuff in your tax-advantaged ones. And hey, keep an eye on your risk game and rebalance regularly. You've got this! ðŸ’°
