I'm not a doctor, but I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your specific liver condition. They might discuss options such as:

- **Lifestyle Changes**: Implementing a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.
- **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow the progression of the disease.

It's essential to have a thorough evaluation to determine the right course of action. Please see a healthcare provider for personalized advice. ðŸ˜Š
