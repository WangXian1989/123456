I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing liver issues. However, I’m not a medical professional, and it’s essential for you to consult a healthcare provider who can give you personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific situation. They will be best equipped to understand your medical history and perform necessary tests to determine the most appropriate treatments for you.

In general, treatment options for liver problems can vary greatly depending on the underlying cause (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Common recommendations might include lifestyle changes such as diet modifications, avoiding alcohol, medications to manage specific conditions, or in more severe cases, procedures to address complications or even a liver transplant. Please reach out to a qualified healthcare provider for guidance tailored to your needs!
