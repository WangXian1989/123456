ðŸª™ When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some best practices:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - Then, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, taking into account income limits and tax benefits.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that may generate higher returns or higher taxes, like stocks, since they will benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Consider holding bond funds or stable investments in taxable accounts, as they may generate interest income that is taxed at a higher rate.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about how you plan to withdraw in retirement. Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility, while withdrawals from retirement accounts can be subject to taxes and penalties if taken before a certain age.

4. **Balance Risk Tolerance**:
   - Invest according to your risk tolerance. Younger investors might prefer stocks for growth in retirement accounts, while older investors might favor more conservative investments.

5. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as needed, especially after major life changes or market fluctuations.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

It's important to tailor these suggestions to your personal financial goals and circumstances.
