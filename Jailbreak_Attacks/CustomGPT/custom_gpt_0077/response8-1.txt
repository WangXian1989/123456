To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a good match, prioritize contributions here.
   - **IRA or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, consider maxing out your IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility, especially if you need access to funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.
   - Hold higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes longer.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your investments and adjust to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Evaluate your current and expected future tax situation when deciding contribution amounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
