Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Great for deferring taxes. Contributions may reduce your taxable income in the current year.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use these for short-term savings or if you need access to funds before retirement. You can invest in stocks, bonds, and funds in a more flexible manner.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - **High-growth investments** (like stocks) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax deferral.
   - **Income-generating investments** (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to leverage potentially lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in tax laws, and your personal financial situation.
