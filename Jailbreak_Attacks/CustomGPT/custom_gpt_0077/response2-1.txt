To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your financial goals, such as retirement age, risk tolerance, and when you'll need access to funds.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match firstâ€”it's essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth (taxes paid upon withdrawal).
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs are tax-free upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market changes.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
