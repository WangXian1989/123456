Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After your IRA, keep contributing to your 401(k), especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changing goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.
