The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free" money. Aim to max out contributions (2023 limit: $22,500 for those under 50; $30,000 for 50+).
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax deferral. Conversely, if you expect your income to increase significantly, a Roth IRA might be wiser to lock in your current tax rate.
   - Consider the tax implications of investment gains in taxable accounts as well; long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher taxable income (like stocks) or tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Other Savings**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, which allows easy access without penalties.
   - Balance your contributions to each account depending on upcoming financial goals (like buying a house or funding education).

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, contribution limits, or changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
