Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Prioritize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If you can afford it, aim to max out your contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 in 2024, plus an additional $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be beneficial.
   - **Max Contributions:** For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50+).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After Maxing Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for extra savings after contributing enough to your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Consider Capital Gains:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Considerations**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavy investing.
   - **Investment Strategy:** Diversify holdings across assets, considering risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and market conditions.
