To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs work similarly to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met. Choose based on your expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains tax on investments sold for a profit. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match on your 401(k) first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - Next, consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth.
   - Finally, funnel any additional funds into your taxable account for flexibility and access.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth through equities, given the tax deferment.
   - **IRA**: Diversify holdings; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You might allocate to dividend-paying stocks or index funds, which can be tax-efficient.

4. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Adjust allocations yearly based on performance, risk assessment, and changing financial needs.

Consulting a financial advisor can also tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation.
