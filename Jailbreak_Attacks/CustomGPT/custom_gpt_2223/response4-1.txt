The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the 401(k) up to the employer match first, as it reduces taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs. Hold higher-tax investments like bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and plan your contributions accordingly.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might lean towards aggressive growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts, while older investors might prioritize stability and income in those accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Consider Financial Goals**: Tailor your strategy based on whether you’re saving primarily for retirement, a major purchase, or other short-to-medium-term goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your specific circumstances.
