To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Employer matches can boost your savings.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for short-term savings.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term Goals**: Focus on retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) to take advantage of compounding.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity if you might need access before retirement.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Check annual contribution limits set by the IRS; it allows higher contributions than IRAs.
   - **IRA**: Understand the limits for traditional and Roth IRAs, and be mindful of income restrictions for Roth contributions.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and consider holding bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on growth.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max out employer contributions** in your 401(k) (to take full advantage of matches).
2. **Contribute to an IRA** if eligible, especially if you want tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
3. **Use taxable accounts** for additional savings or to maintain flexibility for short-term needs.

### Final Considerations
- Regularly evaluate and rebalance your portfolio based on market conditions and personal financial changes.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This structured approach maximizes tax efficiency and aligns with your financial goals.
