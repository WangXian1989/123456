I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options that may be recommended for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Focus on a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid high-fat, high-sugar foods.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications:** 
   - Depending on the underlying cause (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications such as antiviral drugs or corticosteroids might be prescribed.

3. **Avoid Alcohol:** 
   - Abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver health, especially in cases of alcoholic liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring:** 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging may be needed to monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Treat Underlying Conditions:** 
   - Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol should be managed effectively to prevent further liver damage.

6. **Consider Supplements:** 
   - Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a healthcare provider first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options specific to your condition.
