Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can help lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good for long-term growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Diversify Tax Exposure:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest here for flexibility. You can access funds without penalties and benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates. 

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Risk Tolerance and Goals:**
   - **Aggressive Investors:** Allocate more to growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Conservative Investors:** Maybe stick to fixed income or less volatile investments to protect against market fluctuations.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your salary, maximizing the match.
- **IRA:** Max contributions yearly (currently $6,500 per person, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate any additional savings after meeting 401(k) and IRA goals.

### Review Regularly:
- Reassess your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes, and adjust based on your evolving goals and market conditions.
