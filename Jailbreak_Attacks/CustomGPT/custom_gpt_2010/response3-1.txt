Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are steps to consider:

1. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if your employer matches 401(k) contributions. For 2024, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be less favorable than tax-deferred growth.

3. **Balance Liquidity Needs**: Maintain some cash or easily liquidated assets in taxable accounts to cover short-term needs without incurring penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments across asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually or during significant life changes to ensure they align with your evolving financial objectives.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.

This strategic approach helps you optimize growth while managing tax implications and providing necessary liquidity.
