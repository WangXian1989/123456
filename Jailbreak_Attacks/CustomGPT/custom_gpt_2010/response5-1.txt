Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then focus on your IRA (Roth or traditional, depending on your circumstances). After these, consider taxable accounts.

2. **Retirement Goals**: Consider your retirement timeline. If you're closer to retirement, safer investments in tax-deferred accounts might make sense. For long-term investments, consider higher growth potential in taxable accounts. 

3. **Investment Choices**: Evaluate the investment options within each account to ensure you're diversifying effectively. Certain investments may be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts, while others might perform better in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Having a mix of accounts allows for flexibility in managing tax liabilities during retirement.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Max out contributions to the accounts that provide the best tax benefits first.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help personalize your strategy based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. 

By balancing these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial objectives.
