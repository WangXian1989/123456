Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. These accounts grow tax-deferred, and traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, consider diversifying your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your age and risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement should be more conservative.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.
