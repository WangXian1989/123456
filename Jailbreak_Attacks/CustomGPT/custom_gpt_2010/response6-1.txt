To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Best for high-income years as withdrawals during retirement may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can hold investments subject to capital gains taxes but offer liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Utilize your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments that may incur capital gains.
   - Keep more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk profile. Adjust contributions as necessary to prevent drift.

By strategically allocating your contributions based on these principles, you can optimize your money's growth potential while being mindful of tax implications.
