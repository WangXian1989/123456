Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is free money! If you can, max out your contribution to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for more flexible investments. They don’t have contribution limits like retirement accounts and allow for easier access to your funds if needed.

**A Balanced Strategy**:
- Start with employer match in the 401(k).
- Max out your IRA contributions if possible.
- Any additional savings can go into your taxable accounts.

**Considerations**:
- Analyze your tax bracket and future tax expectations.
- Think about your liquidity needs—taxable accounts are more accessible if you need cash.
- Adjust contributions based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.
