To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the maximum contribution limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k), fund your IRA (Roth or Traditional) to benefit from tax advantages. 

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Goals:**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals, as they provide liquidity and no penalties for withdrawals.
   - **Long-Term Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Balancing Your Asset Allocation:**
   - **Diversify Within Each Account:** Ensure each account has a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically reassess and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix.

### 4. **Tax Implications and Withdrawals:**
   - **Withdrawals Strategy:** Plan to draw from your taxable account first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - **Be Mindful of Tax Brackets:** Strategically withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities in retirement.

Implementing these strategies can optimize your overall returns and tax efficiency.
