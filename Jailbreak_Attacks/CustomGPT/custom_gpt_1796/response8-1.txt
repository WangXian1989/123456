When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Employer Match**:
   - **Maximize Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRAs)**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts for tax-deferred growth. They can help reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally, invest here for funds you may need in the short-term or for investing in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **Know the Limits**: The IRS sets annual contribution limits, so plan your contributions accordingly. For 2024, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (additional catch-up contributions may apply if you're over a certain age).

### 4. **Retirement Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Focus**: Consider your long-term goals. If your retirement is many years away, higher-risk investments in your 401(k) and IRA may benefit from market growth.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts to ensure diversification.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Plan ahead for how and when you'll withdraw from each account type, as tax implications differ. For example, IRAs may be taxed as ordinary income.

### 7. **Regular Review**:
   - **Reevaluate Regularly**: Check your allocations annually to adjust as needed based on performance, changing goals, or new financial circumstances.

Finally, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based specifically on your financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals.
