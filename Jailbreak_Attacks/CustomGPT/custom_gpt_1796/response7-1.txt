To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to at least the level needed to maximize that match. This is effectively "free money" and boosts your retirement savings. Consider investing in diversified funds such as target-date funds or low-cost index funds within the 401(k). 

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on your IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between them depends on your current tax rate and expected tax rate in retirement. Roth IRAs are generally advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities or for goals that are shorter-term than retirement. Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. You can also consider municipal bonds for tax-free income.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. For instance, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you might hold more aggressive investments. In taxable accounts, consider holding more stable, income-producing assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, create a withdrawal strategy that maximizes tax efficiency by strategically pulling from each account type. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first allows tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Regularly review your allocations, contributions, and market conditions to ensure you are on track to meet your retirement goals.
