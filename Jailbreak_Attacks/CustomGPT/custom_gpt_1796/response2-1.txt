To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions (up to the annual limit), continue to increase your contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of taxes on capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, mixing stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your age, market conditions, and changing financial goals. Rebalancing helps maintain your target risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Remember, the right mix will depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Adjust your strategy as needed to stay aligned with your overall plan.
