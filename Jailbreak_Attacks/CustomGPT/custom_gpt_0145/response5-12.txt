I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a balanced diet.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues, such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging can help track liver health.

4. **Treating Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can improve liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
