2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues.

3. **Regular Exercise**: Engaging in physical activity can improve liver health.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver recovery.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult your doctor for the best approach for your specific situation.
