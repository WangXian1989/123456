To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum if you havenâ€™t already received the match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement. They allow for easier access without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals can be invaluable.

By balancing contributions strategically across these accounts, you can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential.
