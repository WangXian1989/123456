Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for its tax advantages.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After hitting the IRA contribution, increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Invest in tax-efficient vehicles like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocation each year to adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
