To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Invest here if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar benefits as 401(k)s; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
  
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these accounts for investments that produce lower tax burdens, like index funds or long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can optimize your strategy based on your specific financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to growing your wealth effectively.
