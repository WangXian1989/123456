Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions (up to the limit) to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts if you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid savings account.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified investment portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your contributions as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific needs.
