Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.
   - **401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k). Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk investments (stocks) might be better suited for retirement accounts due to their long-term growth potential, while safer assets (bonds) might be held in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Considerations**:
   - **Withdrawal Plans**: Think about how and when you plan to access the funds. Using tax-advantaged accounts for retirement expenses is often beneficial.
   - **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

Overall, balancing contributions based on tax implications and investment goals can lead to a more efficient portfolio.
