To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your current and anticipated future tax rates.

### 2. **Balance Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-efficient investments**: Place assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Long-term growth**: Keep stocks in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Roth IRA**: Since withdrawals are tax-free, consider using this account for retirement expenses later on, preserving other accounts for now.

### 4. **Adjust for Risk Tolerance**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure all three accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals, especially as you approach retirement.

By focusing on these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution and enhance your long-term financial growth.
