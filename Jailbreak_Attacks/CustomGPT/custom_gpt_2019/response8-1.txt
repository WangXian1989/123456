To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k), contributions can be tax-deductible. Taxes are due on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains yearly.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match (at least up to the match percentage).
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA if eligible; you can contribute to both a Traditional and a Roth IRA if you qualify.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Start with maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts, as they provide better tax advantages.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Place investments that generate interest or dividends in tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds or REITs) to minimize taxable income.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to have lower turnover and qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates (like indexed funds or ETFs).

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If youâ€™re younger and have time to let investments grow, putting more in tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial.
   - As you near retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy and adjust where to put new funds based on expected tax rates at withdrawal.

### 6. **Rebalance Annually:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A tailored plan from a professional can help navigate complex tax situations and optimize your distributions based on your individual financial situation.

By carefully planning your contributions and considering tax implications, you can maximize growth potential and manage your tax burden effectively.
