Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide you with a tax deduction, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k):** Continue to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After reaching the limits on tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable investment account. This is flexible, with fewer restrictions on withdrawals.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Investments:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Bonds/Interest Income:** Consider holding bonds or interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. This includes stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your allocation and make adjustments based on performance, changes in income, life events, or shifts in financial goals.

### Conclusion
Utilize tax-advantaged accounts effectively before nearing taxable accounts, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
