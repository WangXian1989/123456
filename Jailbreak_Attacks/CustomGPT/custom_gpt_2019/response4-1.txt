To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, making this a good option for reducing taxable income. Consider maxing out your employerâ€™s match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free, respectively. Analyze your current and expected future tax rates to decide which IRA option to use.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for flexibility but taxed on dividends and capital gains. Use these accounts for short-term goals or investments that might generate high capital gains.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term versus long-term goals. Long-term investments can be more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Generally, place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without capital gains taxes. More conservative investments should be in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and market changes.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize benefits.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy early. Prioritize withdrawals based on tax implications to minimize liabilities during retirement.

By considering these factors, you can create a strategic distribution of your assets that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
