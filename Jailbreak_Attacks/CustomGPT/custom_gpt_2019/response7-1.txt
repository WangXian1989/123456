To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your 401(k) contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** If you can, also contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This provides additional tax benefits, depending on which type you choose.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These accounts lower your taxable income now. They are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributing to a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is advantageous if you expect higher taxes in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate taxable income or for funds you may need before retirement.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Longer time horizons should lean more heavily towards equities in your 401(k) and IRA for growth.
   - For shorter-term goals or needs, keep those funds in safer or more liquid investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.
   - Use your taxable account for different investments that may not fit into tax-advantaged accounts due to tax implications.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as you add funds.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals can be invaluable.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
