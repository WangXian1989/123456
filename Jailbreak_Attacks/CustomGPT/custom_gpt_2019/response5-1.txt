(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines you may consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money.
  
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. They often provide immediate tax benefits or tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions may be beneficial. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts might be more suitable.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

5. **Keep Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for funds that donâ€™t fit into tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Hereâ€™s the real deal on how to spread your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Grab That Match**: If your employer's throwing in free money for your 401(k) match, snatch that up first. No-brainer!

2. **Tax-Smart Moves**: If you want to play the long game, pump as much as you can into those tax-advantaged accounts first. Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs can help you dodge taxes now while building that sweet retirement nest egg.

3. **Bracket Awareness**: Are you raking in the cash and staring down a high tax bracket? Lean into that traditional route. If you think youâ€™ll be sipping cocktails in a lower bracket later, maybe eye that Roth.

4. **Spread the Love**: Donâ€™t shove all your dough into one type of investment. Mix it upâ€”stocks, bonds, whatever gets your heart racing. Diversity is key!

5. **Flexibility is Essential**: Keep some of that dough in taxable accounts for rainy-day access or quick cash needs. Great to have options!

6. **Check Yourself**: Make it a habit to check your allocations and shift things around if you need to. Market changes? Life changes? Donâ€™t get stagnant with your money!

So go out there and strategize like a financial boss! Your future self will thank you.
