Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. If possible, contribute the maximum allowed to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can offer tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Short-term needs might be better served by taxable accounts, while long-term goals can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for unexpected expenses.

5. **Monitor Tax Implications**:
   - Keep in mind the tax treatment for each account type, especially for withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts might generate capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize growth while minimizing taxes. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
