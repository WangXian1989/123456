To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit before considering other accounts.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Good for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Account Types**: 
   - Use a mix of tax-deferred (401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts for flexibility in retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain liquid savings in taxable accounts for immediate needs.

5. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Choose different investments for each account type based on tax implications.
   - Generally, hold stocks in taxable accounts for long-term capital gains rates, and use tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations annually to stay aligned with your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your financial situation and goals.

Make sure to adjust contributions based on your overall financial plan and retirement goals.
