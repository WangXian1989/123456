Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contributions**: If you can afford it, aim to max out your contributions to benefit from pre-tax deductions.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a **Traditional IRA** if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, allowing for tax deductibility now.
   - Consider a **Roth IRA** if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement and expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider keeping money for short-term goals or emergency funds here, since it allows flexibility without penalties.

**General Strategy**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavy investing.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax liabilities.
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes within each account to reduce risk.

**Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific needs is crucial, as individual circumstances vary widely.
