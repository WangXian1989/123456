I can't provide medical advice, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. They can diagnose your condition and recommend treatments such as:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Healthy diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Specific drugs depending on the liver condition (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Blood tests and imaging to track liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

Always seek guidance from a qualified medical provider for personalized care.
