Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Here's a guided approach:

### 1. **Evaluate Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Horizon:** Longer time frames can favor tax-advantaged accounts. 

### 2. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax; taxes are paid on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments.

### 3. **Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 4. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After employer match, max out contributions to your IRA (if eligible).
   - Prioritize Roth accounts if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** May have limited investment options; focus on low-cost index funds.
   - **IRA:** Choose a diversified mix of assets that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### 7. **Consult a Professional**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to max out your employer match.
2. **IRA:** Contribute the maximum annual limit to your IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds after maximizing the above accounts.

By following this approach, you'll create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your financial goals.
