To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full match if available.
   - **Growth Investments**: Since contributions are pre-tax, consider growth-oriented investments like stocks.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Utilize a mix of bonds and stocks to balance risk as you approach retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep liquid assets in taxable accounts for short-term needs.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across all accounts based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Regular Review**: Reassess your strategy as your financial situation changes.
