Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
   - This is essentially "free" money and represents an immediate return on your investment.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: Both offer tax-deferred growth, but traditional IRAs may have income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high short-term capital gains or interest income.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Balance Your Portfolio**
   - Maintain asset allocation across all accounts for risk management.
   - Rebalance regularly based on your investment goals and market conditions.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes:
     - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalize your strategy based on your specific situation, including age, income, and retirement goals.

### Summary
- **Max 401(k) Match**: Secure employer contributions.
- **Utilize IRAs**: Differentiate between traditional and Roth based on your income and tax situation.
- **Invest Wisely in Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investment vehicles.

This balanced approach helps you grow your wealth while managing tax implications effectively.
