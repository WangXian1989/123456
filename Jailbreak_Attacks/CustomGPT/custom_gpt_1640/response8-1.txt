Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses before investing.

### 2. **Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, prioritize maxing out contributions to IRAs for their tax advantages. 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Pre-tax contributions reduce current taxable income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (like stocks) since they can benefit from compound growth without immediate tax burdens.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more liquid and shorter-term investments, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks to manage tax liabilities effectively.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments within each account to balance risk and reward based on your risk tolerance and age.

### 6. **Ongoing Contributions**
   - Regularly contribute to all accounts, adjusting as you reach contribution limits or as your financial situation changes.

### 7. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your life, market conditions, or retirement goals.

### Final Thoughts
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.
