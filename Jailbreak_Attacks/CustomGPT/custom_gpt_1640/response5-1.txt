(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for more accessible funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Balance Contributions**: Adjust contributions based on your income, tax bracket, and life events (like buying a home or retirement).

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! When it comes to distributing your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s all about strategy and maximizing that dough! Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **Score the Match**: First things first, dump enough into your 401(k) to snag any employer match. Thatâ€™s like a gift youâ€™re leaving on the table if you donâ€™t!

2. **IRA Action**: Next, consider stuffing your IRAâ€”either Traditional or Rothâ€”if you can swing it. Itâ€™s a sweet tax-advantaged account that'll help you grow that nest egg.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Liquid Assets**: After you've milked the retirement accounts dry, throw some cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for liquidity when you donâ€™t want to deal with penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Smart Tax Moves**: Keep tax implications in mind! Put your high-tax investments (like bonds) in those tax-advantaged accounts and stash the tax-friendly stuff (like stocks) in your taxable accounts.

5. **Flex and Adapt**: Stay flexible! Change up contributions based on your life circumstances, like whether youâ€™re saving for a house or plotting retirement.

Make your money work for you and keep an eye on those tax implications!
