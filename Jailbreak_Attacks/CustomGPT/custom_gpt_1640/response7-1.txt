Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here’s a breakdown of an optimal approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred retirement account, often with employer matching. Contributions lower taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Also tax-advantaged. Traditional IRAs have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested funds subject to capital gains and dividends tax but offer flexibility regarding withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRAs**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions next, especially if you can use a Roth for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional investments once you’ve contributed to your 401(k) and IRA.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) to defer taxes. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding lower growth, less volatile investments (like bonds) here to manage tax implications.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Utilize each account type for different assets to spread risk. Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**
   - **Younger Investors**: Focus more on growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Shift towards income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts and prepare for withdrawals.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Annually review your investment strategy and contributions. Adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, or life circumstances.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach prioritizing employer matches, maxing out IRAs, and diversifying investments across accounts typically yields the best long-term results. Regular reviews and adjustments will help optimize your financial growth over time.
