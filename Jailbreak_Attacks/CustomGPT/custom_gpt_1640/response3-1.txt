To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching; pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Includes Traditional and Roth options; Traditional can be tax-deductible, while Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds; capital gains taxes apply.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - Maximize employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess how much risk you're willing to take.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - **Time Horizon**: Longer horizons can afford more risk; shorter horizons might need more conservative investments.

### 4. **Establish Contributions**
   - Allocate funds based on employer contributions and your income:
     - **Max 401(k) up to match**.
     - **Contribute to IRA**: Aim for the maximum limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023).
     - **Fund taxable accounts** as needed after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio regularly according to changing goals, market conditions, and performance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions based on eligibility (Traditional vs. Roth).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### Additional Considerations
- **Emergency Savings**: Maintain a separate fund for unexpected expenses.
- **Debt Management**: Prioritize paying down high-interest debt if applicable.
