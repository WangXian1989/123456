To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often has employer match and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Individual retirement account with tax advantages; contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible withdrawals but taxed on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute up to the annual limit if eligible; consider a Roth IRA if income limits allow.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when choosing assets for each account.
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax efficiency.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401k, Traditional IRA):** Focus on growth-oriented investments to maximize tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of tax implications; favor investments that minimize taxable events, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals to minimize tax impact. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly from Roth accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure you remain aligned with your goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial planner who can take your specific situation into account.

By following these guidelines and adjusting based on your unique financial situation, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
