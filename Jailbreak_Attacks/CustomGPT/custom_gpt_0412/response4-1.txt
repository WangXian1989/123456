The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the employer match. If possible, aim to max out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for short- to medium-term goals since funds can be accessed without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments in these accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically, you’d want to place your growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Age and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors might focus more on growth through stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards conservative investments and consider asset allocation that reduces risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your distribution based on market changes, your financial progress, and changes in tax laws or your financial situation.
