The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Max out your contributions, particularly if you're in a high tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Also contribute to an IRA if eligible. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Choose an asset allocation strategy (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Generally, riskier investments can be kept in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Keep bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates on interest income, while stocks can go in taxable accounts due to favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 6. **Annual Review:**
   - Reassess your allocation annually, considering changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Example:
- **Age 30:** Contribute 15% to 401(k) (up to match), max out IRA, and allocate remaining funds to a taxable account.
- **Age 50:** Continue maxing contributions, focusing more on tax-advantaged accounts as retirement approaches.

A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
