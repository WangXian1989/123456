Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to the employer match first. The limit for 2024 is $23,000 for those under 50 ($30,500 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) if eligible. Consider a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income but taxed upon withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that incur long-term capital gains for better tax treatment. Avoid frequent trading to minimize short-term capital gains.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **401(k) Investments**: Often limited in options. Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and target-date funds that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA and Taxable Accounts**: Broader investment choices, including index funds, ETFs, or individual stocks. Focus on asset allocation that fits your financial goals and timeline.

### 4. **Emergency Fund & Debt Management**
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts for liquidity.
   - Pay down high-interest debt before maxing out investment accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy to personal circumstances, including your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth potential while managing risk and tax implications.
