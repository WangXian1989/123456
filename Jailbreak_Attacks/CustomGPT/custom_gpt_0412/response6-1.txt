To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** Max out your traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) here, as you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that are less tax-efficient, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, since you’ll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals. Adjust as needed based on performance and market conditions.

### 4. **Utilize Tax Loss Harvesting**
   - In taxable accounts, sell underperforming investments to offset gains, thus reducing your tax liability.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, optimizing for the type of investments held in each account, and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can effectively maximize your overall returns and minimize tax liabilities.
