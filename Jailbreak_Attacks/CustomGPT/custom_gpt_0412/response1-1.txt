Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions lower your taxable income, and the funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial, allowing tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute the annual maximum to take full advantage of the tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** These accounts allow penalty-free withdrawals at any time, which can provide liquidity if needed.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize tax liability.

### **General Strategies:**
- **Emergency Fund:** Keep 3-6 months of expenses in liquid savings before investing.
- **Diversify Investments:** Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts based on risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### **Final Thoughts:**
- Assess your tax situation and retirement goals.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Balancing these accounts strategically can help maximize your retirement savings while minimizing taxes.
