The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Often offers employee matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
- **IRA**: Offers either traditional (pre-tax contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or Roth (post-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) options.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Funds are after-tax and can be easily accessed without penalties. Ideal for short-term goals or flexible investments.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+).
3. **Back to 401(k)**: If you have maxed out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit ($22,500 for 2023, $30,000 if age 50+).
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond your tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on lower-tax investments (like index funds) to minimize tax impact.

### 3. Consider Investment Strategy
- **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (stocks, ETFs).
- **Income Generation**: Consider holding dividend-paying stocks or bonds in taxable accounts (to benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends).

### 4. Regular Review and Rebalance
Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. Tax Considerations
Consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to optimize your contributions based on your specific tax situation and future income expectations.

This strategy ensures you leverage tax benefits while maintaining flexibility in your investments.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize 401(k) for employer match, then IRAs, then taxable accounts.**
- **Place growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.**
- **Reassess regularly for alignment with goals.** 

By following this structured approach, you’ll enhance your financial future while effectively managing your assets.
