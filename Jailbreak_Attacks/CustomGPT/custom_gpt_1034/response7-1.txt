Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now—ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, prioritize that for tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, but distributions will be taxed in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you don't exceed the annual contribution limits ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older as of 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-to-medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Balanced Approach**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep enough liquid cash in taxable accounts for emergencies.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and invest accordingly across all accounts. Typically, hold more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA) and more stable ones (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations based on market performance and any changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your specific situation and goals.
