1. **Social Media Blitz**: Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat are not just platforms; they're lifestyles! Use memes, catchy videos, and trends to create content they canâ€™t scroll past. Think funny yet informative!

2. **Real Talk**: Donâ€™t hit them with the boring old spiel about policies. Talk about stuff they care aboutâ€”like, "Do you want a livable planet? Hereâ€™s how weâ€™re gonna do it!" Authenticity is key. They can smell BS from a mile away.

3. **Influencer Power**: Get influencers or local celebs who resonate with youth culture to carry your message. When their fave TikToker approves it, itâ€™s like instant clout!

4. **Engagement Over Lecture**: Use polls, quizzes, and challenges. Make it feel like a game, not a lectureâ€”because, honestly, who wants to sit through that? Theyâ€™ll spread the word if it's fun!
