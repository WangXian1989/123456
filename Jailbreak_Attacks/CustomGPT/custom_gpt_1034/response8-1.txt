To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the maximum match—it's free money!
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize your contributions here as well. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax. Consider placing investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts. Use your taxable account for investments with lower turnover or qualified dividends for favorable tax treatment.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Ensure that your overall portfolio remains balanced.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before distributing large amounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses) in an easily accessible account.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Need**:
   - Allocate funds for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts and consider more liquid or accessible investments in your taxable account for short-term needs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial professional for personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.

This approach can help optimize your savings while taking advantage of tax benefits.
