Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, as these contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Once you’ve maximized your 401(k) match (and ideally, the maximum contribution limit if you're able), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you’re aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k) contributions (plus $7,500 if you're over 50) and up to $6,500 for IRA contributions (plus $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account for additional investments. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in a taxable account.
   - Keep in mind that interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term capital gains are usually taxed at lower rates.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, and keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where you might be taxed on the income generated.

5. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Keep an eye on changing tax laws and contribution limits.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If you're unsure about your specific situation or need personalized advice, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to meet your individual needs.

By balancing contributions among these accounts, you can optimize your investment growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
