Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for immediate access, avoiding penalties.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts for compound growth.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower capital gains or tax-efficient funds.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Contribute to those providing tax breaks at withdrawal or during contributions, based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. 

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - **Adjust Contributions**: Review your allocations annually or as financial situations change to optimize growth and tax efficiency.

This strategic approach can help optimize your savings and investments over time.
