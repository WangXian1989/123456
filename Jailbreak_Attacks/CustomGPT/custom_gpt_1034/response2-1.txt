Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a traditional or Roth IRA. Consider contributing to this next to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains may be subject to capital gains tax, so it might be better to place less tax-efficient investments here.

3. **Strategic Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate taxation.
   - Use stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as these often generate interest that is taxed as ordinary income.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses outside of these investment accounts for liquidity.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Monitor your allocations regularly and rebalance as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

It may also be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
