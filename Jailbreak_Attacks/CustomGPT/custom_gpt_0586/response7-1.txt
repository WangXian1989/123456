The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a breakdown to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match; it's essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50, including catch-up contributions).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contributions to a 401(k) and Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income. Withdrawals from these accounts in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments accessible before retirement age, keeping in mind capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Compare the investment options available in each account type. Aim for a diversified portfolio that balances risk and growth potential across all accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses in a readily accessible account, separate from your investment accounts.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**
   - Younger investors may focus more on growth (stocks in tax-advantaged accounts) while those nearing retirement might shift to more conservative investments (bonds and cash-like instruments).

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changing personal goals.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (maxing match)
- **IRA**: Max contributions ($6,500)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder for flexibility and opportunities

### Personal Considerations:
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy based on your specific goals, investment timeline, and risk tolerance.

Utilizing this framework should help you effectively manage your money across these accounts while considering growth, taxes, and future needs.
