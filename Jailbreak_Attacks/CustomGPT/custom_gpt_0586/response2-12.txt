   - **Antiviral Medications**: For chronic hepatitis B and C to reduce viral load and liver damage.
   - **Vaccination**: For hepatitis A and B to prevent infection.

3. **Cirrhosis**:
   - **Treat Underlying Causes**: Alcohol cessation, managing diabetes, or treating hepatitis.
   - **Medications**: To manage symptoms and prevent complications, such as diuretics for fluid retention.

4. **Liver Cancer**:
