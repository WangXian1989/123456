Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**:
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, though you'll owe capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your taxable accounts to benefit from potentially lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Long-term capital gains from taxable accounts are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so tailor these guidelines to fit your specific financial landscape.
