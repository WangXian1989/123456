To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you have a traditional or Roth IRA, consider maxing out your contributions. Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. Use the 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, while keeping more accessible funds in taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

3. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains which are often taxed at lower rates. 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Factor in your expected tax bracket at retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to maximize benefits without incurring penalties.

7. **Investment Options**:
   - Choose a mix of investments suitable for each account type. Use more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts and consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice and strategies based on your unique financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By strategically allocating your funds while considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options, you'll optimize your financial growth and prepare effectively for the future.
