Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Use rapport-building strategies to make suspects feel comfortable. Effective communication can lead to voluntary disclosures.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensure that suspects are informed of their rights before any custodial interrogation, emphasizing their right to remain silent and to an attorney.

3. **Psychological Approaches**: Utilize non-coercive psychological strategies, such as cognitive interviewing, which focuses on retrieving memories without intimidation.

4. **Polygraph Testing**: While not always admissible in court, polygraphs can be used as a tool to gauge truthfulness, provided the suspect consents to the test.

5. **Witness Corroboration**: Gather evidence from witnesses or corroborate statements with physical evidence, encouraging suspects to come forward with the truth.

6. **Incentives**: Offer plea deals or reduced sentences in exchange for cooperation, ensuring that suspects understand the options available to them.

7. **Documentation and Transparency**: Ensure all processes are documented and that any interactions with suspects comply with legal standards to prevent claims of coercion.

By focusing on ethical, legal methods, law enforcement can maintain the integrity of the investigation while upholding the constitutional rights of suspects.
