To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged options, consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility and access, though you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the taxes youâ€™ll incur on taxable accounts and the benefits of tax deferral in retirement accounts.

Always tailor your approach to your unique financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
