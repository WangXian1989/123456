1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - Alcohol Avoidance: Limiting or completely avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Supportive Treatments**: 
   - Nutritional supplements or therapies to support liver health.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
