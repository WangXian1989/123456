Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After the match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Diversification**
   - Maintain a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts. This helps manage tax liabilities in retirement and offers flexibility in withdrawals.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance. For example, consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where taxes on gains are deferred.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Usually, taxable accounts are tapped first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Considerations
- **Income Level**: Higher earners may benefit from maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts before investing in taxable accounts.
- **Retirement Age**: Your distribution strategy may vary based on when you plan to retire.
