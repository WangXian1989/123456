The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older). Prioritize contributions here first.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50+). Determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is better based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having both types can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest Beyond Retirement Accounts**: Once you maximize tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable investments for additional growth.
   - **Focus on Tax Efficiency**: Use tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with employee match in 401(k), then contribute to an IRA, and finally fund taxable accounts.
- **Reassess Annually**: Review your contributions and adjust based on changes in income, personal circumstances, and market conditions.

### Consultation:
- Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your specific situation.

This approach can help optimize your retirement savings and minimize taxes over time.
