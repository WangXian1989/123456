Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversification**: Keep a diverse mix of investments across all accounts. Choose different asset allocations based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or long-term investments, since capital gains tax rates can be lower.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on account types and tax implications in retirement. Withdraw from taxable first, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free (Roth).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain desired risk levels.
