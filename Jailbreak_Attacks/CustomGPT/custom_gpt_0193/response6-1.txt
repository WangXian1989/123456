To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is free money.
   - **IRA**: Fill this up next for its tax benefits, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA.

2. **Assess Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use tax-advantaged accounts mainly for growth-focused investments.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid and accessible funds in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use for higher-return investments that may incur taxes upon withdrawal.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually to adapt to changes in financial goals or market conditions.

By implementing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
