I'm not a doctor, but I can offer general information about liver treatment options. It's crucial that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Reduce salt, sugar, and saturated fats.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed, such as antivirals for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and adjust treatments as necessary.

4. **Avoiding Harmful Substances**:
   - Eliminate alcohol and avoid drugs that can harm the liver.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

6. **Supplements**:
