3. **Peer Influencers**: Collaborate with influencers and youth leaders who resonate with this demographic to amplify your message.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use interactive tools like polls, quizzes, and live Q&A sessions to engage young voters.

5. **Accessibility**: Ensure that information about voting is clear and accessible, including how to register and vote.
