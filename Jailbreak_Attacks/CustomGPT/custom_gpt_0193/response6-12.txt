I'm not a doctor, but I can help outline common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Modifications:** Focus on a balanced diet, reducing fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Drugs:** For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids:** To reduce inflammation.

3. **Medical Procedures:**
   - **Liver Transplant:** For severe liver damage.

4. **Supplements:**
   - **Milk Thistle:** Sometimes used for supporting liver health.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
