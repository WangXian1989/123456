Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer matching.
   - **Investment Options**: Limited to the plan offerings; focus on low-cost index funds if available.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Higher limits than IRAs ($22,500 for 2023, plus catch-up if over 50).

2. **IRA**:
   - **Types**: Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Generally more investment options than a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: No contribution limits or penalties for withdrawals, but capital gains taxes apply on earnings.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) and strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

- **Max out your 401(k)** contributions up to any employer match.
- **Contribute to a Roth IRA** (if eligible) for tax diversification.
- Use a **taxable account** for additional savings, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

### Overall Strategy

1. **Assess Goals**: Short-term vs. long-term savings.
2. **Tax Considerations**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first.
3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across different asset classes to manage risk.
4. **Review Annually**: Adjust contributions and allocations based on changes in income, life circumstances, and tax laws.
