Distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guide to help you consider your options:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the match limit, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: The tax treatment varies based on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. Different accounts might have different investment strategies—consider keeping more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) and more stable income-producing assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute over time, the allocation of your investments can drift from your desired strategy. Regularly rebalance your portfolios across all accounts to maintain your investment strategy.

6. **Withdrawals and Income Planning**: As you approach retirement, consider how you’ll draw on each account type. Strategies might include delaying withdrawals from your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes in retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone's financial situation is unique. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances and help you create a comprehensive strategy that fits your overall financial goals.

Consider your specific circumstances and any relevant changes in tax law or contributions limits that may affect your decisions!
