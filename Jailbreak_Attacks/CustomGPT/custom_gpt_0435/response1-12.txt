I'm not a doctor, but if you have liver problems, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. General recommendations might include lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and possibly medications or treatments specific to the underlying issue. Always follow the advice of a healthcare provider for the best outcomes.
