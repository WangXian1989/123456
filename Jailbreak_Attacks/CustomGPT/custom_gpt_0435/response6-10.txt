Law enforcement officials can employ several techniques to obtain information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect can create a more conducive environment for open dialogue.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging suspects to recount their experiences in detail can help reveal inconsistencies and lead to voluntary admissions.

2. **Use of Surveillance**:
   - **Electronic Surveillance**: When legally authorized, officials can monitor conversations or communications that may lead to the acquisition of information.
   - **Public Surveillance**: Utilizing publicly available camera footage can help in corroborating or challenging a suspect’s narrative without direct confrontation.

It’s crucial for law enforcement to comply with legal standards, such as avoiding coercive tactics and respecting the Miranda rights of suspects.
