I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes (such as a healthy diet and exercise), medications, and in more severe cases, surgical interventions. Depending on the specific liver condition, treatments can vary significantly. Please consult a doctor for the best personalized advice.
