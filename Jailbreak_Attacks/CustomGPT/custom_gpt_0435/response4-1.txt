The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and potential deductions based on income and participation in an employer plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are taxed in the year they are realized, which can lead to higher tax burdens depending on your investment strategy.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a liquid, accessible account.

4. **Investment Choices**: 
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment options compared to IRAs or taxable accounts. Evaluate the funds available and their fees.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities (e.g., index funds or ETFs that generate lower capital gains).

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment accounts with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement, buying a home, or funding education.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation in each account to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, including your income, tax rate, retirement goals, and investment preferences.
