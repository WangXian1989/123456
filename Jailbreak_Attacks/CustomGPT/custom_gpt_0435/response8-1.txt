The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Try to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older). A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA** contributions may lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they are realized. This can make taxable accounts suitable for investments that you intend to hold long-term.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're investing for long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping those funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. Different accounts can be used for different investment strategies based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts regularly to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances, including income, tax situation, and retirement objectives.

By considering these factors and prioritizing your contributions, you can effectively allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
