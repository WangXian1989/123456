(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, you may consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any company match, as it's essentially "free money." After that, maxing out your IRA can be beneficial due to its tax advantages. Lastly, you can place any additional funds into your taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. It may also be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

After that, dive into your IRAâ€”traditional or Roth, depending on whether you want tax breaks now or in the future. Whatever's left over? Throw it into your taxable accounts. That way, you've got some liquidity to play with, and you can invest in whatever tickles your fancy without Uncle Sam breathing down your neck immediately. Just keep an eye on capital gains tax, â€˜cause nobody wants a surprise tax bill! And hey, donâ€™t forget to adjust based on your age and how soon you want to retire; your strategy will shift as you get closer to those golden years!
