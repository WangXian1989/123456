To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that free money first.

2. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions to this account, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you need the tax deduction now, a Traditional IRA might be more suitable.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, more aggressive growth investments like stocks can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments might be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Rebalancing and Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your goals and changes in the market or your personal situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help you tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Remember, the best approach depends on your individual circumstances, including your income, tax situation, and retirement goals.
