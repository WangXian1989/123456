When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies for optimal allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out contributions if possible, taking into account the tax implications (traditional for tax savings now, Roth for tax-free withdrawals later).

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Assess your current income and expected retirement tax bracket. This will influence whether to prioritize traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax) accounts.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.

3. **Balance with Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once tax-advantaged limits are met. Consider investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or municipal bonds.
   - Keep in mind capital gains tax when deciding on investment strategies.

By strategically allocating your contributions, you optimize your tax benefits while preparing for future financial needs. Always tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation and long-term goals.
