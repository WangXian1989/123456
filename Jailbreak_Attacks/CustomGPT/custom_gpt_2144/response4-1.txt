Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on contributing to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. A traditional 401(k) and IRA provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Understand Contribution Limits:** Make sure you're aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution available for those aged 50 and older. For IRAs, the limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:** Distributing money into accounts largely depends on your current and expected future tax rate. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might want to focus on 401(k) and traditional IRAs. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

5. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts:** It's a good idea to have a diversified investment strategy within each account. Ensure you're not overly concentrated in any particular asset class.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure, consider meeting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This strategy helps balance tax efficiency and growth potential while preparing for your long-term financial goals.
