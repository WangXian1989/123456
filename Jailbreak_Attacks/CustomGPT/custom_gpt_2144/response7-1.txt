The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions with a traditional IRA or can take advantage of tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

2. **Tax Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize funding your tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) because they offer tax benefits, either at contribution or at withdrawal. Choose a traditional IRA if you want to potentially lower your taxable income now, or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments within these accounts are well-diversified to spread risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds tailored to your risk profile.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. Keep in mind that investments in these accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and market conditions. Over time, you may want to shift more into conservative investments as you approach retirement.

6. **Emergency Funds**: Itâ€™s wise to have an emergency fund in a separate account before heavily investing in these accounts. Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses saved before committing most of your funds to investments.

Ultimately, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
