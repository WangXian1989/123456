Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate money to taxable accounts for increased flexibility. These accounts can be useful for short-term goals since you can withdraw funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, you might want to hold growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for better long-term growth, while more stable investments (like bonds) can go in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions, adjusting as necessary.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
