I'm not a doctor, but I recommend reaching out to a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. They will be able to assess your condition and suggest the appropriate treatment options based on your specific needs. It's important to take liver health seriously, so please make sure to consult a qualified medical expert.
