To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Know the annual limits for contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and traditional IRA) for pre-tax income, which can lower your taxable income in the present.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if your income allows, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Assess Your Investment Goals**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Generally, consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. This might involve drawing from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Seek Professional Guidance**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor, especially if you have complex financial situations or specific goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for growth and tax efficiency.
