The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the specific features of each account. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Take advantage of employer matching contributions if available. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - Consider contributing enough to get the full match before directing money elsewhere.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth, which allows your investments to grow without being taxed until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it potentially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - Max out the contributions to an IRA if you can, after considering your 401(k) contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need access to before retirement or for short-term savings goals.
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains; consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies, like holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.
   - This account can offer flexibility and liquidity but may not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute to your 401(k) until you get the full match if available.
- **Max Out IRAs**: After maximizing your employer's match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if they align with your tax strategy.
- **Fund a Taxable Account**: Once youâ€™re comfortable with your retirement accounts, you can start contributing to taxable accounts, especially if you have short-term goals or want liquid assets.

### Regularly Review and Adjust:
- Your investment strategy should involve regular reviews to adapt to life changes (e.g., marriage, career changes) or shifts in your financial goals. 

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always a good idea to ensure you are making the best choices for your individual circumstances.
