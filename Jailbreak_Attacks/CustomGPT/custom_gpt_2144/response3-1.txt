The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored and may offer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax). Traditional IRAs may also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Matching**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), ensure you're contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Utilize tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) for your higher-income years, allowing your investments to grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - Roth IRAs can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Establish an Emergency Fund**: 
   - Before heavily investing, make sure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, low-risk account.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: 
   - Within your accounts, diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Review Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for all accounts, and adjust your allocations accordingly.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Depending on your situation, it may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced strategy that optimizes your investment across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
