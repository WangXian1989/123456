Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, you should contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA (whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA) since both offer tax benefits.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt, consider paying that off before investing. The interest on such debts can outweigh potential investment gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund in place before directing significant amounts into retirement accounts. A common recommendation is to have about 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Your risk tolerance and investment time horizon should dictate how you allocate funds among these accounts. Younger investors with a long time horizon may allocate more towards equities, while those closer to retirement may prefer more stable investments.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account. For instance, Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, while withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Roth accounts, on the other hand, are funded with post-tax income, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation and investment performance in each account to ensure it aligns with your overall goals and adjust as needed.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy to your specific situation.
