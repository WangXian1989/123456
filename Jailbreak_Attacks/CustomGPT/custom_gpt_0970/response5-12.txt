Treatment options vary widely based on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis). Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (e.g., diet and exercise), medications (like antivirals for hepatitis), and in some cases, surgical interventions or liver transplantation. Regular monitoring and follow-up care are crucial to manage liver health effectively.
