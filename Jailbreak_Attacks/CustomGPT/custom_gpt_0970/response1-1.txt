Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines that you might consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider the investment options within the 401(k) and the associated fees. Some plans have limited options or higher expense ratios.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions in the year you contribute, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax bracket and expected bracket in retirement.
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or income that you might need in the short term, as these accounts provide more flexibility.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk. Consider your asset allocation strategy based on your age, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of how withdrawals from each account will be taxed. Typically, withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, whereas qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations across accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances.
