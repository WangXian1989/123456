When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, investment options, and your time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help guide your decision:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching contributions. It often has a limited selection of investment options.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Provides tax advantages for retirement savings. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Standard brokerage accounts that do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility in accessing your money without penalties.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be tax-deductible, thus reducing your taxable income.
   - Qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are tax-free, providing an advantage if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains tax upon selling assets.

4. **Establish Priorities**:
   - After maximizing your employer match in your 401(k), consider fully funding your IRA (particularly if you qualify for a Roth IRA).
   - Once you've contributed to both retirement accounts, you can allocate additional funds to your 401(k) or a taxable account based on your needs and goals.

5. **Assess Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices within each account. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, you may want to prioritize contributions to your IRA or taxable account where you have more control.

6. **Consider Your Financial Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you're saving for a short-term goal, a taxable account might be more suitable.
   - For long-term retirement savings, maximize contributions to retirement accounts first.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.

Ultimately, it's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized allocation strategy based on your unique circumstances and goals.
