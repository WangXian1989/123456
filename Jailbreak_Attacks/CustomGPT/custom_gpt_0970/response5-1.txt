(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first. Here are some steps you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, it's wise to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to IRA:** Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a valuable option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** After addressing the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, as this allows for tax-deferred growth.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you still have funds available after maximizing contributions to the above accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investing. These accounts can provide more flexibility in terms of access to funds and investment options.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
