When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here's a structured approach to help guide your decision:

### 1. Understand the Accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Account**: Any investment account that is not tax-advantaged. Capital gains taxes apply when selling investments for profit.

### 2. Distribution Strategy:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
     - If possible, maximize contributions to your IRA, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Allocate Remaining Funds**:
     - If you have maxed out tax-advantaged accounts and still have money to invest, consider using your taxable account for additional investments.
     - Diversify your investments across all three account types to balance growth and mitigate risk.
   - **Consider Tax Implications**:
     - Investments in a taxable account can generate capital gains and dividends, which are taxable in the year received. Favor tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, tax-managed funds) for these accounts.
     - Avoid frequent trading in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 3. Ongoing Evaluation:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changing financial situations, market conditions, and tax laws.
   - Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

This strategy aligns your contributions with both retirement goals and tax efficiency, ensuring a comprehensive approach to wealth accumulation.
