Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers similar tax benefits as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   
3. **Diversify Accounts**:
   - If you're early in your career or expect your income to rise, prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free growth.
   - For those closer to retirement, traditional accounts may reduce current taxable income.

4. **Invest Tax-Efficiently in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds or tax-efficient funds) and avoid frequent trading.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Aim to consistently contribute to all accounts to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your investments based on changes in your life circumstances and financial goals.

### Suggested Order of Contributions:
1. 401(k) up to the employer match
2. Max out Roth IRA (if eligible)
3. Max out 401(k) contributions
4. Invest in taxable accounts

This approach creates a balance of tax-deferred and tax-free growth, while also providing flexibility in retirement withdrawals. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
