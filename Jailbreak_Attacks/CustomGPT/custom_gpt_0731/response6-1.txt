Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts comes down to your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Contributions**: Maximize employer match (if offered).
   - **Tax Advantage**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deferred growth; contributions may be deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Allocation Based on Age**: Younger individuals may prefer Roth for future tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Funds can be accessed without penalty, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Aim for the employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA.
- **Balance Growth and Accessibility**: Use IRAs for long-term growth and taxable accounts for short-term needs.
- **Diversification**: Keep a mix of equities and bonds across all accounts for risk management.

### Key Considerations:
- **Tax Bracket Implications**: Understand how your distributions will affect your tax bracket.
- **Retirement Timeline**: Adjust strategies based on the expected time to retirement.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%
