The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Focus on maximizing contributions annually, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket, as it reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing employer contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings beyond retirement accounts. They provide flexibility for both short-term and long-term goals. Investments like index funds or ETFs can be efficient for tax purposes due to their lower turnover rates.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) outside of these accounts.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-yield investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing circumstances and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
