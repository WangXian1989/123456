Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Strategy**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consideration**: Focus on the contribution limit set for 401(k) plans.

### 2. **Contribute to IRAs**
   - **Types**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial. 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deductible contributions, suitable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Strategy**: Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Purpose**: Use for goals less than 5-10 years away or for funds you may need flexibility with (short-term goals).
   - **Strategy**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Consideration**: Keep an eye on capital gain thresholds and tax brackets.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Determine your risk tolerance and allocate assets (stocks, bonds, cash) accordingly within each account, considering tax implications.
   - **Tax-efficient investing**: Consider holding more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and your evolving financial situation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can ensure your strategy is aligned with your specific financial situation and goals.

### General Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before making investments.
- **Debt**: Pay off high-interest debt first.
- **Timeline**: Your age and how close you are to retirement can significantly affect your distribution plan.

Tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances for optimal results.
