Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Standard Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to maximize any employer match, and consider contributing up to the annual limit if possible. This account is tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** If you arenâ€™t phased out of contributing to a Roth IRA or deducting traditional IRA contributions, consider maxing this out next. This can provide tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth, depending on the type.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term or for investments you want to sell in the near future. Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This can reduce risk and enhance returns over time.

5. **Tax Considerations:** 
   - *Taxable accounts* can be beneficial for assets that produce lower tax rates (like qualified dividends).
   - *Retirement accounts* (like 401(k) and IRA) allow for tax-deferred growth, making them preferable for high-growth assets.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Consider your future withdrawal strategy. Taxable accounts may be easier to access without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA funds typically face early withdrawal penalties.

7. **Review Annually:** Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in income, investment performance, and financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your unique circumstances and goals.
