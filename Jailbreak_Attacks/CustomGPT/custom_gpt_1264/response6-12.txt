I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information regarding liver health. For any liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Dietary Modifications**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt can be beneficial.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is vital for liver health.

2. **Medications and Supplements**:
   - **Antivirals**: If the liver issue is related to viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help.
   - **Liver Supplements**: Some may consider milk thistle or other supplements, but these should be discussed with a physician.

Remember, it's essential to follow up with a medical professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
