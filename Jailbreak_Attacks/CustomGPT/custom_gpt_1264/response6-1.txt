To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - For retirement savings, prioritize maxing out contributions in your 401(k) and IRA first, as they provide tax deferral on growth.
   - Utilize a Roth IRA if eligible for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Consider Current Tax Bracket**:
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts if you are in a lower tax bracket, allowing you to pay lower taxes on interest or dividends.
   - Investing in tax-efficient funds can minimize taxable income in these accounts.

3. **Balance Risk and Liquidity Needs**:
   - Evaluate your risk tolerance and time horizon to determine the percentage to allocate to stocks, bonds, or other assets across the accounts.
   - Maintain a portion in liquid assets within taxable accounts for near-term needs or emergencies.

4. **Adjust Based on Market Conditions**:
   - Periodically rebalance your allocations based on performance and changes in market conditions.
   - Consider taking advantage of market downturns to buy in at lower prices, potentially boosting overall returns. 

This combination will help optimize your investment strategy while considering tax implications and liquidity needs.
