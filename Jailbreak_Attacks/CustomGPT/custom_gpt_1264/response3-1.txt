The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations to guide your decision:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions and has higher contribution limits. It offers tax-deferred growth, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw funds.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Comes in two main types – Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allow for flexibility with withdrawals and can hold a variety of investments. You will owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term savings.
   - Make sure to max out any employer match in your 401(k) before contributing to your IRA.
   - Consider tax implications of your investments; for example, holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts can minimize tax liability.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance. For long-term goals, you may want to take more risk.
   - Diversification across all accounts is key to managing risk.

4. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account separate from these investment accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your investment goals.

A typical strategy might be:
- Maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
- Use a taxable account for short-term goals or when you’ve maxed out retirement accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can give you a personalized plan based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
