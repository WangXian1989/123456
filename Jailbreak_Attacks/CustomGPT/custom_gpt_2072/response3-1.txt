The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, consider fully funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth) as these accounts often have tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions at the time of contribution.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, continue funding your 401(k) up to the maximum contribution limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: Once you have contributed to both your 401(k) and IRA, you can focus on taxable accounts. These accounts allow for flexible withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for savings outside of retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that you are investing in a diverse range of assets across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your situation may change over time. Regularly reassess your financial strategy to ensure that it aligns with your goals.

Additionally, consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
