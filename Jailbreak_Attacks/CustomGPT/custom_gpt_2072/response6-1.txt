When considering the optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should focus on several key factors, such as tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
- **401(k) Plans**: Employer-sponsored retirement accounts with potential employer matching. Contributions reduce taxable income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs give you tax deductions upfront.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investment accounts where you can easily access funds. Capital gains tax applies to profits made when selling investments.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
- **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Aim to at least contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Consider tax implications**: Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s offer tax-deferral benefits. Balance this with the potential tax-free growth of Roth accounts based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

### 3. Diversification and Liquidity:
- **Allocate to IRAs for tax-advantaged growth**: Maximize IRA contributions to benefit from tax-deferred compounding.
- **Keep a portion in taxable accounts**: This provides liquidity and flexibility for goals outside retirement, such as buying a home or other investments.

### 4. Continuous Assessment:
- **Rebalance periodically**: Ensure your distribution aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Stay informed on tax laws**: Changes can affect the efficiency of your investments across these accounts.

### Conclusion:
A strategic approach often involves:
- Maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to exploit any employer match.
- Fully funding your IRA for its tax advantages.
- Keeping an emergency fund and some investments in taxable accounts for liquidity. 

By effectively navigating these accounts, you maximize your investment potential while considering tax implications and your financial needs.
