(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Generally, it is wise to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, as they typically offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next, as it offers potential tax advantages for retirement savings.
3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the employer match and IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k), aiming for the maximum allowed limits if feasible.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement or for investments that could benefit from favorable capital gains tax treatment.

Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your evolving financial situation and goals.
