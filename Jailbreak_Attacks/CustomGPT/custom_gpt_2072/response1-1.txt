Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals, including earnings, are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages on contributions or withdrawals, but they provide flexibility. You pay capital gains tax on profits, and you can withdraw funds without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Diversifying your investments across these accounts can help manage risk. Different accounts can hold various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, or real estate.

4. **Retirement Age and Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your expected retirement age. Those closer to retirement may want to prioritize more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while younger individuals may opt for growth-oriented strategies.

5. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have adequate liquid savings in case you need funds before retirement. Taxable accounts are often better suited for short-term needs.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and goals.

In summary, a balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while considering your immediate and future financial needs is typically best.
