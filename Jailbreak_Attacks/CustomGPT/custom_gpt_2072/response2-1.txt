When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some guiding principles to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon selling assets. Consider using these accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Emergency Funds**: Before heavily investing in any account type, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund. This typically equates to 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Your time until retirement can influence your allocation:
   - Younger investors may prioritize higher-risk investments in their 401(k) or IRA for potential growth, while gradually shifting toward more conservative investments as they age.
   - Those closer to retirement might want to hold more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically assess your investment strategy and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in your retirement timeline.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given individual circumstances differ, it may be wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your specific goals and situations.

Ultimately, the best allocation will depend on your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Balancing these factors strategically can optimize your savings and investment for retirement.
