To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have access to a 401(k) plan, especially one with matching contributions, prioritize contributions here. It's a great way to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. As of 2023, for a 401(k), the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable brokerage account. This gives you the flexibility to access your money without penalties and provides opportunities for investing in various assets.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts with an eye on tax implications. For instance, hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts and place higher-taxed investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consult a financial advisor. They can help you optimize your investment strategy based on your goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while maximizing your tax advantages and growing your wealth for retirement.
