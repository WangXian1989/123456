To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first** (401(k) and IRA).
   - Allocate higher-growth investments to tax-deferred accounts to maximize compounding.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you're aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - Prioritize contributions to your employerâ€™s 401(k) match before moving to IRAs.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for tax implications when withdrawing funds from different accounts.
   - Consider your estimated income during retirement to optimize withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
   - Balance your asset allocation consistent with your risk tolerance and goals.

By focusing on these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
