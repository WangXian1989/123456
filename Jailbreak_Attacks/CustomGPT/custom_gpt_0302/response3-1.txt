To ensure proper distribution of your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Understand Each Account**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored with tax benefits; contributions are pre-tax or Roth (after-tax).
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement accounts with tax benefits; can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where you pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. This affects how much you should allocate to each account.

3. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (free money).
   - Max out IRA contributions if you can afford it, especially for Roth IRAs if you qualify.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place assets that generate high tax burdens (like bonds or REITs that produce interest income) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider getting professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This layered approach can help you optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
