I'm here to help with insights on distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. 

### General Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match contributions to benefit from free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, if eligible, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and investing in assets subject to long-term capital gains tax.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, then taxable accounts.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your allocations with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
