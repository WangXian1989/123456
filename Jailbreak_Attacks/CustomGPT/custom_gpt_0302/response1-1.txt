To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Good for reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Less tax-efficient than retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals might lean towards taxable accounts for accessibility.
   - Long-term goals benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Employer Matches**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize those before funding taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts to spread risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you intend to withdraw funds to manage taxes effectively in retirement.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Max Out Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match.
2. **Max Contributions to IRAs**: Depending on income limits, prioritize contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA.
3. **Contribute Additional Funds to 401(k)**: After maxing out other accounts, contribute more to your 401(k).
4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Investing**: Fund these accounts with leftover cash once other accounts are optimized.
