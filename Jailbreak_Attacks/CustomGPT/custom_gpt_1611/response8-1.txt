Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to capture the full match first. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as these contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth, which is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you have short-term goals (like a house purchase), prioritize taxable accounts for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Investments in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts require you to pay capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit. Consider holding long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. This can help balance risk and return according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and performance to ensure they align with your goals. Adjust contributions and investments as needed, especially after major life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If uncertain, seek guidance from a financial advisor. They can provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances and goals.

This holistic approach can help you optimize your investments across these accounts.
