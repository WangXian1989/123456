To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general strategies:

1. **401(k):** 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it; it’s essentially free money.
   - Focus on higher contribution limits, as they allow for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Traditional IRA:**
   - Contribute if you’re eligible, especially if your tax rate is higher now than you expect it to be in retirement.
   - If you expect a lower tax rate in retirement, a traditional IRA can be beneficial.

3. **Roth IRA:**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Good for younger investors who may be in a lower tax bracket now.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use for short-term goals or investments that may not fit within tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### General Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have adequate savings for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your investment strategy based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments to balance risk and return, adjusting for tax implications based on each account type.
- **Tax Planning:** Consider tax implications when withdrawing funds from each account type during retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor is always a good idea to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
