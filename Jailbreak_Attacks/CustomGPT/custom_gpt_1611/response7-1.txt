To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. They also provide flexibility if you need funds before retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation:** Decide on your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks should be held in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth, while bonds or more stable investments can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (2023) or $30,000 if age 50 or older.
   - IRA: $6,500 (2023) or $7,500 if age 50 or older.
   - Taxable accounts have no contribution limits.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and growth potential.

6. **Regularly Reassess:** Continuously monitor your investments and adjust your contribution strategy as your situation changes (income, spending needs, market conditions).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice and strategies tailored to your unique financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By strategically distributing your funds and considering tax implications, you can maximize your retirement savings and overall financial health.
