When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **Max out employer match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income, tax filing status, and eligibility, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (either Traditional or Roth).
   - **Continue contributing to 401(k):** After maxing out your IRA, contribute additional funds to your 401(k) to take advantage of its tax benefits.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation:
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in these accounts can be used for short-term goals or emergencies, as they do not have early withdrawal penalties. They are also subject to capital gains tax, so strategically consider your investment choices (e.g., tax-efficient funds).

### 3. Consider Your Time Horizon:
   - **Long-term vs. Short-term goals:** Funds needed in the short term (within 5 years) should generally be kept in taxable accounts or savings, whereas funds for retirement should be focused in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. Review Your Investment Strategy:
   - **Asset Location:** Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. Regularly Reassess:
   - **Annual Review:** Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, and tax laws.

### General Rule of Thumb:
Aim for a balanced approach, maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, followed by taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

If you have specific goals or circumstances, you should consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
