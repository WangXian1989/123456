Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts strategically can help optimize your overall investment growth and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions up to the annual limit if possible; in 2023, it's $22,500 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider opening a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial for you due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or for holding cash reserves for immediate needs.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, in your taxable account to minimize tax liabilities on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account type, ensure you're well-diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Tax Implications**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type, especially in retirement, as the tax treatment varies significantly.

6. **Financial Goals and Timeline**:
   - Align your investment choices with your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and timeline for those goals. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your individual financial situation.

Evaluate regularly and adjust your contributions and asset allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.
