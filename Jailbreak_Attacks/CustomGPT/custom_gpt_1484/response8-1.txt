Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, prioritize your IRA (Roth or traditional), as these accounts offer tax advantages.

3. **Build Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. For example, place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account and higher-growth, tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings set aside in an emergency fund before heavily investing.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
