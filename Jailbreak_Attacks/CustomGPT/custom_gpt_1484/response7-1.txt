Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for effective retirement planning. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains and income where tax rates may be lower compared to ordinary income rates. This is suitable for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, keeping higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
