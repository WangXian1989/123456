I'm not a doctor, but here are some potential treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Incorporate a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding excessive fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medication:**
   - **Anti-inflammatory drugs** may be prescribed to reduce liver inflammation, depending on the specific condition.
   - **Antiviral medications** for viral hepatitis, if applicable.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Advanced Treatments:**
   - **Liver Transplantation** may be considered for severe liver disease if other treatments fail.

Make sure to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
