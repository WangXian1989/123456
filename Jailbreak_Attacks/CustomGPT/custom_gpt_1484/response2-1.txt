Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you’re eligible, contribute to an IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts. These are more flexible but less tax-efficient.
   - **Investment Types:** In taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Withdrawals Strategy**
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize your tax liability, typically starting with taxable accounts before tapping into tax-deferred accounts.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. Regularly review your strategy to adapt to changes in income, taxes, and financial goals.
