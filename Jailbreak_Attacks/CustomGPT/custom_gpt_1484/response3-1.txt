The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed annually. Best for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Long-term goals are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need sooner or for specific goals.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate funds based on your comfort with risk, adjusting for the time horizon and volatility of each account type.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation based on your investment strategy.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Revisit and adjust your distribution periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
