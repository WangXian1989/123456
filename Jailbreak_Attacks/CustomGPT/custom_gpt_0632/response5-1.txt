Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for current tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals:**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth due to their tax advantages.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or more immediate access to funds.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage risk.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
