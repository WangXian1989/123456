Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) until you reach your employer's match, then consider how much you want to contribute based on your income and tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out employer contributions, direct additional funds to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide current tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to the above accounts, allocate funds to a taxable brokerage account. These accounts provide flexibility and access to your money without penalties, but you'll pay taxes on any gains or dividends.

4. **Consider Investment Options**: Evaluate investment options within each account type. Generally, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while holding more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, financial goals, and changes in tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This approach helps balance the advantages of tax deferral and tax-free growth against the need for flexibility and liquidity.
