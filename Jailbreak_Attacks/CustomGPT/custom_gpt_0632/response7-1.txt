Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially “free” money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your budget permits.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and Traditional IRA reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed. In contrast, Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars and can grow tax-free. Think about your expected tax bracket in retirement to guide your contributions.

### 3. **Assess Investment Options**
   - Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) and IRAs. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, you might prioritize your IRA or taxable account after implementing the employer match.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Once you’ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. Tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, can minimize tax burdens in these accounts.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Diversify across asset classes and consider your time horizon for each investment account.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your target asset mix and adjust to changing financial situations.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances and help optimize your investment strategy effectively.
