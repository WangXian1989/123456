Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations to help guide your strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers higher contribution limits and may include employer matches. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. Suitable for mid-term objectives.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After meeting the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (and Roth IRA if eligible) to benefit from tax-free growth or tax deductions.

### 4. **Consider Wealth Injection Timing:**
   - If you anticipate needing money within a few years, prioritize your taxable account to avoid penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, ensure a diversified asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, riskier investments are more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Over time, your asset allocation may shift due to market performance. Regular rebalancing ensures you maintain your desired level of risk across all accounts.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help align your investment strategy with your overall financial situation and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize the employer match.
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA.
3. **Taxable Account:** Use any remaining funds for taxable investments, especially if you have short- to medium-term goals.

By considering these factors and strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your accounts.
