To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older.
   - **IRA:** The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** There are no contribution limits, but you’ll need to manage capital gains taxes.

2. **Differentiate Your Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Offers pre-tax contributions, which reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out your employer’s match first.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), but with income limits for deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA:** If eligible, contributes after-tax; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Account:** Best for funds you might need before retirement; focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., index funds).

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Higher-risk investments can be placed in accounts with tax advantages.
   - **Bonds vs. Stocks:** Typically, keep bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxation on interest income.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Prefer tax-efficient funds (like ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Location:** Place higher-growth assets (e.g., stocks) in tax-deferred accounts and interest-generating assets (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your allocations remain in line with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
   - **Diversify:** Within each account, diversify across asset classes to mitigate risk.

6. **Consider Future Tax Brackets:**
   - **Withdrawal Strategies:** Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement, as it may influence your tax situation.

7. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account to cover unforeseen expenses before tapping into your investment accounts.
