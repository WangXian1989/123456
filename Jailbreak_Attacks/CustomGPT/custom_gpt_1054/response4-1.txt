Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for after-tax contributions. Withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, but you can access the funds without penalties, offering flexibility.

3. **Investment Growth Potential**: Consider the types of investments that can grow over time with tax-deferred or tax-free growth:
   - Focus on high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or assets that generate dividends or interest, as these may be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Age and Time Horizon**: Your current age and when you plan to retire affect your distribution strategy:
   - Younger investors might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
   - As you approach retirement, consider a mix of accounts to balance tax implications.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will access your funds in retirement:
   - Consider strategies such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax rules and investment strategies, working with a financial advisor can help tailor your distribution plan to your individual situation.
