Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matches first; this is essentially free money.
   - If possible, contribute up to the annual limit to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible (income limits apply).
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, deferring taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term (less than five years) or for investment flexibility.
   - Consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your portfolio at least annually to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Balancing these accounts effectively can improve your long-term financial security and tax efficiency.
