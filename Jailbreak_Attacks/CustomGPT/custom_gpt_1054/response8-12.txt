1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and following a balanced diet.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and health.
4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treating any related conditions, such as diabetes or hepatitis.
