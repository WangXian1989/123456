To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, which can reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: You can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free in retirement). Traditional IRAs provide tax benefits upfront, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals after retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - Consider your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you plan to retire soon, you might prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA due to their tax advantages while using taxable accounts for immediate needs.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older), and for an IRA, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older). Maximize these accounts first to benefit from the tax advantages.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to mitigate risk. Consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan how you will withdraw money in retirement to minimize taxes. For example, you might want to draw from taxable accounts first, then traditional IRAs, and finally 401(k)s, which could help reduce your tax burden.

A potential strategy could be:
- Max out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions.
- Contribute enough to an IRA to take advantage of any tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you think you may need access to those funds before retirement.
