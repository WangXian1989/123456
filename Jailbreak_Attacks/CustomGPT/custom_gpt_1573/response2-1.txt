To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Max out contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) as they reduce your taxable income in the present. The 401(k) limit for employees is typically higher than for IRAs.

3. **Roth Options**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged options, consider investing in taxable accounts. They provide flexibility and are useful for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to benefit from long-term growth without immediate taxes.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to manage tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first before tapping into tax-deferred or tax-free accounts.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.
