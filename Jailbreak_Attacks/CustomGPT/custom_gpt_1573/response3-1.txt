To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For instance, 401(k) contributions for 2023 are up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, and withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Income from these accounts (e.g., dividends, capital gains) is taxed in the year earned.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: Align your allocation with your financial goals and timeline. Longer-term goals may benefit from higher equity exposure, while shorter-term goals might require more conservative investments.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Reassess and adjust your portfolio allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure that you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, seek professional advice tailored to your individual financial situation.

### Sample Allocation Plan:
- **401(k)**: 30%
- **IRA**: 20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 50%

This distribution can vary based on your specific circumstances, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Adjust according to your financial needs and market conditions.
