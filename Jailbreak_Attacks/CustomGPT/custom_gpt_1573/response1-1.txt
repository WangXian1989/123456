Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your retirement goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA after maximizing the employer match. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Tax Diversification**: Balance between tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and taxable accounts. The benefits of tax-advantaged accounts include tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, while taxable accounts offer flexibility with withdrawals and no penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, it may be more beneficial to focus on pre-tax contributions (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA). Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth contributions.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes that align with your strategy.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: In retirement, plan to withdraw from accounts strategically to minimize taxes and maximize your income, often considering the order of which account to withdraw from first.

Lastly, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
