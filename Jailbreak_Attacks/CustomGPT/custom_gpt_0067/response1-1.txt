To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if you get a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify based on income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good if you want tax deductions now.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for flexibility and capital gains treatment, so consider them once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Balance your investments across all accounts with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you'll access funds in retirement. Taxable accounts often offer more flexibility, while tax-deferred accounts may be taxed upon withdrawal.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually or after major life events to ensure they still align with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
