Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as itâ€™s effectively free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Maximize Contributions**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Diversification**: Invest in a diversified portfolio including ETFs, index funds, or stocks.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investment strategies like tax-loss harvesting.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid assets accessible in case of emergencies.

### **General Strategy**
- **Start with Retirement Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRAs before taxable accounts to maximize tax advantages.
- **Diversify Investments**: Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your long-term goals.
- **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and life changes.
