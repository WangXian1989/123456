To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These offer tax advantages; focus on higher growth investments since they grow tax-deferred.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), as withdrawals will be taxed later.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments to avoid triggering taxes on high-growth assets.

4. **Flexibility and Liquidity**:
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for more accessible cash flow without penalties from early withdrawal of retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

This strategy balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and liquidity. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
