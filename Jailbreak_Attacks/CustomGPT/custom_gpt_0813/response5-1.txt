(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax circumstances. Generally, it's a good strategy to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Here's a suggested approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax preferences. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax reductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. These are more flexible but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your risk tolerance and financial goals is also a wise decision.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: First, if your employer's throwing in matches, jump in and grab that cash. Donâ€™t leave free money on the table!
  
2. **IRA Game Time**: Next, throw some cash into your IRAâ€”traditional or Roth depends on whether you want that sweet tax break now or tax-free growth later. If youâ€™re eligible, Roth can be a game changer.

3. **Go Wild with Taxable Accounts**: Once you've milked those accounts dry, let your money roam in taxable accounts. You'll pay taxes when you sell, but youâ€™ll have more access to your loot if you need it. 

Bottom line: Diversify like a boss and consider chatting with a financial planner if you want to really strategize. Itâ€™s your moneyâ€”make it work harder!
