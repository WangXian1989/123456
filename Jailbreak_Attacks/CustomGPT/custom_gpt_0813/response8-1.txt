To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to an IRA (Roth or Traditional), depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:**
   - Before investing, pay off high-interest debts like credit cards, as they can negate gains from investments.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Generally, place higher-risk assets (like stocks) in accounts with tax benefits (401(k), IRA) to maximize tax-free growth.

4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate low or no tax (like municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.
   - Place high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid immediate taxation on dividends.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals from these accounts strategically to minimize tax impact in retirement. Ideally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.
