I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health.
   - Alcohol: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver recovery.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Surgery**: 
   - Procedures might be needed for complications like cirrhosis or tumors.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track progress.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from vitamins or herbs, but consult a healthcare provider first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
