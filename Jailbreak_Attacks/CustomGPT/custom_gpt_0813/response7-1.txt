Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for accessing the funds. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
  
### 2. **Consider the Tax Implications:**
   - Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, while withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals, making them ideal for long-term growth.
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on gains, so consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep cash or easily liquidated assets in your taxable account for short-term needs.
   - For long-term savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Consider asset location strategies (e.g., putting bonds in a tax-advantaged account).

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Retirement Timeline:**
   - Adjust your contributions based on how close you are to retirement. Younger investors might favor growth-oriented investments, whereas those nearing retirement might prefer stable, income-producing assets.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** Max out employer match, then contribute 15% of your salary.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate any remaining funds post-401(k) and IRA contributions.

### Conclusion:
Create a personalized plan based on your financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to optimize your strategy for asset distribution.
