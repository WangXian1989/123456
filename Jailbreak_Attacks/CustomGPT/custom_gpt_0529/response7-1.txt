The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Tax is paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement (after certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed annually, but thereâ€™s flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Prioritize Accounts by Tax Treatment**:
   - If you're in a high tax bracket now, prioritize contributions to traditional accounts (401(k) or traditional IRA) to get tax deductions.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts for their tax-free growth.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments to balance risk and returns based on your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you need funds soon, keep more in taxable accounts for easier access to your money. For long-term growth, pump more into tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary widely, so consulting with a financial professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By strategically planning your contributions among these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and potentially reduce your tax burden.
