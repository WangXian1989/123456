Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here are some key strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Investments:** Keep bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes on interest.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks here since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate and qualified dividends may be tax-free.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk and improve returns.
   - Depending on your investment goals and risk tolerance, consider a mix of equity, fixed income, and alternative investments.

### 4. **Regular Reviews and Rebalancing**
   - Monitor your portfolio allocations periodically and rebalance as necessary to align with your goals and market conditions.

Following these strategies can help you effectively distribute your investments for growth and tax efficiency. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
