Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current income, future income expectations, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions can be tax-deductible, which is helpful for tax savings now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but funds grow tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: They provide access to funds without penalties or restrictions, suitable for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of capital gains taxes on investments. Holding onto investments longer (more than a year) may lead to lower tax rates on gains.

### Strategy for Distribution:
1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, then max out an IRA (if eligible) before further contributions to the 401(k).
2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Depending on your expected future tax situation, prioritize Roth contributions or taxable accounts after maximizing matched contributions.
3. **Invest Based on Goals**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals with more liquid investments, while using tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

### Example:
- First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure the employer match.
- Next, if eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA.
- With remaining funds, continue to invest in both your 401(k) and taxable accounts based on your financial goals.
