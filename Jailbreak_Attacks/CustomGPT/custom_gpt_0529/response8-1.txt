When distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investments and minimize taxes:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute the maximum allowable amount if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if your income allows, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA may be better for its tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains, as these are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider utilizing tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset any capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Place tax-inefficient assets (e.g., bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Place tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on distributions.

5. **Emergency and Short-Term Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account separate from your investment accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on risk tolerance and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Depending on your individual situation—income level, tax bracket, retirement goals—it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

These strategies can help you create a balanced approach to managing and distributing your investments effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
