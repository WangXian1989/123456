Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds after contributing to your IRA, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement or for investments that generate lower tax rates. Consider tax-efficient investments such as index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. For instance, holding investments for more than a year can lower capital gains taxes, and interest from taxable bonds can be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified. Maintain an asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
