Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match â€“ it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if feasible.
- **IRA:** Take advantage of the tax benefits, whether traditional or Roth, based on your expected tax situation in retirement.

### 2. Balance Contributing to Taxable Accounts
- **Taxable Investments:** Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- **Traditional vs. Roth:** If you're in a lower tax bracket now, Roth accounts might be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher bracket later, prioritize traditional accounts.

### 4. Emergency Fund
- Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 5. Diversification
- Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to minimize risk.

### Conclusion
- Regularly reassess your strategy as income and financial goals change. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
