To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Higher contribution limits, often includes employer match.
   - **IRA:** Lower contribution limits; consider traditional vs. Roth based on future tax expectations.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax; withdraw later at your tax rate.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now; Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax; invest in tax-efficient assets.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth; consider target-date funds.
   - **IRA:** Can hold a diverse range of investments; use this for less liquid or riskier assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Opt for low-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have liquid savings before investing aggressively in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Diversify Across Accounts:**
   - Avoid duplicating investments; ensure a mix of bonds, stocks, and cash across all accounts.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- Max out IRA contributions if eligible.
- Invest in taxable accounts for additional growth and liquidity.
