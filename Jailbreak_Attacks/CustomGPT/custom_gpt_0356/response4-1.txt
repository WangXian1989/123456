Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to capture the full match. This is often considered free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing up to the maximum limit, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and income. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in your income, financial goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
