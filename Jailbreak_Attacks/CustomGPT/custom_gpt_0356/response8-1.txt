To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth (tax-free growth).

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments with lower tax burdens (like index funds) since you'll pay capital gains taxes on them.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth), so prioritize these for higher tax-rate investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, REITs) within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before making significant investments.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your target asset allocation.

6. **Age Consideration**:
   - Younger investors can lean more toward stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might focus on more stable investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for your investments.
