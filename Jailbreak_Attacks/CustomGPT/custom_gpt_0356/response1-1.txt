Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a match. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth, such as stocks or mutual funds that may maximize tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more liquid investments and tax-efficient strategies, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Remember, individual circumstances vary, so adjust these suggestions based on your needs!
