Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged options. This gives you flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Hold assets with high growth potential (e.g., stocks) since you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free growth; consider keeping higher-growth assets here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax implications.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
