I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Healthy diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoid alcohol: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can help liver health.
   - Weight management: Losing weight if overweight can improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), doctors may prescribe specific medications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Treating Underlying Conditions**:
   - Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can benefit liver health.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Stay away from harmful substances that can exacerbate liver issues.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
