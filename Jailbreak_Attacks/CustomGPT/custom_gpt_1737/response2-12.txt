I'm not a medical professional, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. Alternative treatments could include herbal supplements, but be sure to discuss these with a doctor first. Remember, early diagnosis and professional guidance are key!
