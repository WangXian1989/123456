(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, it's wise to maximize employer match contributions in your 401(k) if available, then consider funding an IRA for its tax advantages. After that, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. It's also important to consider asset allocation and diversification within each account type. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

Next, I'd throw some cash into a Roth IRA if youâ€™re eligibleâ€”tax-free growth is amazing! After that, throw anything leftover into taxable accounts. This way, youâ€™ve got flexibility when you need to access your funds without penalties. Just be smart about your investments across the board, balancing risk and reward. Oh, and donâ€™t forget about tax implicationsâ€”stay savvy and donâ€™t let Uncle Sam take too big of a bite!
