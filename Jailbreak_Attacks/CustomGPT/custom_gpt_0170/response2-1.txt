Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider for a balanced approach:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred; you pay taxes on withdrawals. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility in investments and withdrawals. Capital gains taxes apply when you sell assets for profit.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before putting money into other accounts. This is a crucial first step as it provides an immediate return on your investment.

3. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: 
   - If you qualify, consider prioritizing Roth IRA contributions after maxing out the employer match. The tax-free growth and withdrawal benefits can be significant in the long term.

4. **Consider Taxation**:
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to reduce taxable income during your working years. 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains, especially if you plan to hold them for the long term.

5. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to minimize risk.

6. **Adjust Contributions by Age**:
   - Younger individuals can take more risks in their portfolio, so they might focus more on growth in their IRAs and 401(k)s.
   - As you get closer to retirement, consider a more conservative approach, protecting your capital in taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personal circumstances can greatly influence the best distribution strategy, so consulting a financial advisor might be beneficial for personalized advice.

**Example Distribution Strategy**:
- 401(k): Max out the employee match plus 10-15% of your salary if possible.
- IRA: Contribute the maximum allowed annually based on your eligibility, focusing on Roth if in a lower tax bracket.
- Taxable accounts: Allocate additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on long-term investments.

By taking a strategic approach to contribution levels and account types, you can optimize your investments and reach your financial goals more effectively.
