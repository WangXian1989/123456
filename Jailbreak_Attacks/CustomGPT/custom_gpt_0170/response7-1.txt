Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, your retirement goals, investment options, and your risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before investing in other accounts. This is essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). This can provide tax advantages whether you’re eligible for deductible contributions (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you're eligible, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit if you have the financial capacity. This can reduce your taxable income and allow for higher tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. These accounts can provide more liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Be mindful of the types of investments you hold in each account. Generally, it's advisable to hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth. In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

**Consulting a Financial Advisor**: It's always beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation and goals.

Keep in mind that laws and recommendations can evolve, so staying informed and periodically reviewing your investment strategy is essential.
