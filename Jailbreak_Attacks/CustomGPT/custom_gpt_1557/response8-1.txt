Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA): Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here if you've maxed out retirement accounts. You’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

3. **Assess Your Investment Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re saving for retirement (long-term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, keep money in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions and life changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
