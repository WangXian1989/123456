To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you haven’t maxed out your 401(k) contributions after the IRA, direct additional funds there, especially if it's a pre-tax account which lowers your current taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Consider low-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Balance your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Keep in mind that different accounts have varying tax implications for withdrawals (e.g., penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts).

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account changing tax laws and personal financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific financial situation and goals.
