I'm not able to provide personal medical advice. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your condition. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures, depending on the specific issue (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis). A healthcare provider can give you the best guidance based on your situation.
