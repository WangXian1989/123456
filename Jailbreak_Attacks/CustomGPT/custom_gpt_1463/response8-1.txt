Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate; long-term capital gains have lower tax rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced allocation across accounts in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

4. **Investing Priorities**:
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs).
   - Hold bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax exposure.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals based on your tax situation; draw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

6. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - Adjust contributions and allocations based on how far you are from retirement age.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
