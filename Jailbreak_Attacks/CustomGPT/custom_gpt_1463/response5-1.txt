Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax benefits and overall investment growth. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you can, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for those under 50, $30,000 for those 50 and older for 2023).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for money you'll need before retirement or for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains.

### 5. **Monitor Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider tax implications for each account type when selecting investments.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Revisit and adjust your allocations as necessary, especially if your investment returns shift your initial percentages.

### Final Tips:
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice based on your individual situation can enhance your strategy.
- **Stay Informed**: Tax rates and investment options can change; keeping updated helps in adjusting your allocations.

This balanced approach optimizes tax advantages while aligning with your short- and long-term financial objectives.
