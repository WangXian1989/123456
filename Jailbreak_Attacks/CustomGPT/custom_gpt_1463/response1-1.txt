Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Fully fund your 401(k) with the maximum allowable contribution, then consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA.
   - If you can, contribute to both types of IRAs if you haven't hit the limit.

3. **Manage Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or dividends.
   - Consider investing in index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable events.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across the accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax growth.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations regularly based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and improve your long-term growth potential.
