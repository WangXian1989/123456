To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower annual tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs. Hold assets for longer than a year to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax burdens. Place tax-efficient investments (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, ensuring that you maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across these accounts to maintain your investment strategy and risk profile.
