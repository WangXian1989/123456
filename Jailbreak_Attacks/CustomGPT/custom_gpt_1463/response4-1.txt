Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax (for 401(k)) or tax-deductible (for traditional IRA), lowering your taxable income now. Roth options allow for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments generate capital gains tax; prioritize placing higher-turnover investments (like stocks) here to minimize taxation.

### 3. **Diversification and Goals**
   - Match your asset allocation to your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - For retirement goals, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals (buying a house, etc.), consider taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify within each account (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk profile.
   - Balance growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your distribution based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
   - Adjust contributions and allocations as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If your situation is complex, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice considering your individual circumstances.

This framework should give you a solid foundation on how to manage your funds across these accounts effectively.
