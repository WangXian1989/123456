Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While you don’t get tax advantages, capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate if held long-term.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type (for example, $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs in 2023).

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for assets that may grow significantly (like stocks) to maximize tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (like bonds or cash equivalents) to limit tax exposure on interest and dividends.

5. **Withdrawals & Retirement Timing**:
   - Plan for when you might need to access funds. Taxable accounts allow more flexible access without penalties, while funds in 401(k)s and IRAs typically incur penalties if withdrawn before 59½.

6. **Review Your Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your funds distribution based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor is also beneficial for personalized planning.
