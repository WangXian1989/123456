Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and the specific benefits of each account type. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

### 2. **Evaluate Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices; focus on low-cost index funds or ETFs.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers more diverse investment options, including individual stocks and bonds, which may provide better asset allocation flexibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals or specific needs; consider tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Balance Based on Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for more liquidity.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA provide tax deferral; consider tax implications of withdrawals, especially if you're near retirement.
   - With a Roth IRA, contributions grow tax-free; this can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Stay Flexible**
   - Regularly reassess your portfolio based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Summary
- Prioritize employer match in 401(k), fully fund IRAs if possible.
- Balance growth and liquidity based on your specific timelines and goals.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
