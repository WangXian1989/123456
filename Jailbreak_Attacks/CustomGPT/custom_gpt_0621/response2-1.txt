Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to receive the full match. It’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:**
     - Aim to fully utilize your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers a match.
     - After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
     - Roth IRAs are particularly valuable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds.
     - Hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts if possible, as interest income can be taxed at higher rates.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio**
   - Periodically review your allocations to stay aligned with your investment goals and adjust for any significant changes in the market or your personal circumstances.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies for Retirement**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds from each account type in retirement to minimize taxes and maximize overall longevity of your funds.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation, ensuring you optimize your investments over time.
