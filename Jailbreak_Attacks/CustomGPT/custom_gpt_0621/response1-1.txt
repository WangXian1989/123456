When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (traditional 401(k)), reducing your taxable income now, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, assuming certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money in these accounts is subject to annual taxes on dividends and capital gains. However, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to manage risk effectively.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in place before maximizing contributions to these accounts. 

5. **Consider Withdrawal Needs**: Plan based on when you may need to access funds. Taxable accounts offer more liquidity, making them suitable for shorter-term goals.

6. **Tax Strategy**: You may want to prioritize higher tax accounts (like a 401(k)) first, then fund IRAs, and finally use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement plans change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
