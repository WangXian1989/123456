Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If youâ€™re eligible, consider maxing out an IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains to take advantage of lower tax rates.
   - **Income-Generating Investments:** Keep high-yield investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce taxable income.

### 3. **Evaluate Investment Choices**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on diversified options like index funds or ETFs with low expense ratios.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider investing in assets with favorable tax treatment, such as municipal bonds.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts can optimize your tax situation and help you achieve your retirement goals more effectively. Regularly review and adjust your allocation as your personal circumstances and financial markets change.
