Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages; Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible investment accounts without tax-advantaged benefits. Investments are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs:** If eligible, consider fully funding your IRA (especially Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement).
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** After securing the match and funding your IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k).

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals:** If you need liquidity or plan to use funds before retirement, keep more money in taxable accounts, where you can easily access it.
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place assets expected to grow significantly (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Tax Bracket**
   - **Higher Income Years:** Contribute more aggressively to tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and Traditional IRA to lower taxable income.
   - **Lower Income Years:** Consider Roth contributions to take advantage of lower tax rates.

### 5. **Consider Your Withdrawals Strategy**
   - Plan how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. This may influence how you allocate investments now.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Review your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
There's no one-size-fits-all strategy; the best distribution will depend on your unique financial situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your needs.
