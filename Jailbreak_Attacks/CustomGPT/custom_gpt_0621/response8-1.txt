To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. If your employer offers a match, consider it "free money." Aim to max out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Choose between a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement. These accounts can be beneficial for short-term gains or specific financial goals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments within each account are diversified across various asset classes. This can reduce risk and improve potential returns.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains. Use taxable accounts for bonds or dividend-paying stocks, as these generate income that may be taxed at lower rates.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to each account to maintain a steady investment plan.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio allocation periodically based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best allocation for your specific circumstances, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

This balanced approach helps optimize both short-term and long-term financial goals while minimizing tax liabilities.
