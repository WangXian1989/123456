(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to your IRA.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Choose based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may give you an upfront tax deduction. If youâ€™re eligible, max out your contributions to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or if you plan to withdraw funds before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments in these accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy according to your specific needs.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, hereâ€™s the lowdown! The best way to divvy up your cash between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on your personal financial vibe, goals, and when you plan to partyâ€”uh, I mean retire!

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer is throwing free money at you with matching contributions, grab that! Aim to contribute at least up to the match. After that, crank up your contributions until you hit a good targetâ€”like 15% of your salary if you can swing it.

2. **IRAs**: Think about your tax situation. If youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket now and expect to be a big spender in retirement, a Roth IRA might be your jam. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can help you dodge taxes for now. Max these out! 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your go-to for liquidity. Great for mid-term goals, but watch those capital gains! Keep it simple: low-turnover index funds or ETFs can save you headache and taxes.
