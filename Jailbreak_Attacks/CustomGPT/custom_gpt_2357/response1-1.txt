Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Maximise contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 2. **Maximise Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed (currently $6,500 per year, or $7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Traditional versions provide tax deductions now, taxes upon withdrawal. Roth versions offer tax-free withdrawals but no upfront tax break.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Often limited in options. Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and target-date funds based on risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Greater investment flexibility; consider a diverse portfolio tailored to your risk profile.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs). 

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Evaluate your asset allocation as life circumstances change (income, dependents, retirement age).

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Tax-advantaged accounts**: 70% (max contributions to 401(k) and IRA)
- **Taxable accounts**: 30% (for liquidity and short-term needs)

### Conclusion
Balance your contributions based on your financial goals, tax implications, and immediate needs. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalised insights tailored to your situation.
