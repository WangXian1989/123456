I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition and its severity. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet low in fats and sugars, and rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Limitations:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver recovery.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Frequent check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging studies.

4. **Avoiding Toxins:**
   - Stay away from substances that can harm the liver, such as certain medications, industrial chemicals, and illicit drugs.

5. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
