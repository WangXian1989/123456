To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and may include employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments grow tax-deferred but are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize long-term growth.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for assets that generate lower or qualified dividends to minimize tax implications.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds) strategically:
     - **401(k):** Focus on growth assets like stocks, as they benefit from tax deferral.
     - **IRA:** Use a mix of growth and conservative investments based on your risk tolerance.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold more conservative or income-generating assets to manage tax liabilities.

### 4. **Match Investments to Account Type:**
   - Utilize tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Reserve high-growth or volatile assets for 401(k) and IRA where tax benefits can be maximized.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically adjust your asset allocation to ensure you're maintaining your desired investment strategy across all accounts.

### Conclusion:
A well-thought-out strategy tailored to your financial goals and tax situation will optimize your returns and tax efficiency. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
