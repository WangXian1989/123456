Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to optimize tax benefits and achieve your financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After employer matching, consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you have additional funds after maxing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or for funds you may need before retirement age.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Allocate funds based on your current and expected future tax brackets. Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth assets to defer taxes.

### 6. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, and use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
