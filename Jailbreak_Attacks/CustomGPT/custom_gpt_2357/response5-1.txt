Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy that balances growth, tax efficiency, and your overall financial goals. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Allocate to IRAs**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, as they offer tax advantages based on your income and retirement strategy.

### 2. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here, as they are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Higher Turnover Investments in Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Hold assets with higher expected turnover, like actively managed funds or bonds, in your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Current vs. Future Income**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth contributions may be beneficial.
   - **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Be aware of RMD rules for 401(k)s and traditional IRAs after age 72, which could impact your tax planning.

### 4. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - Maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to achieve your desired risk level and return potential.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals. 

Itâ€™s often advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances. This helps ensure you're optimizing your contributions while aligning with your long-term financial objectives.
