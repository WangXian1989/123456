I’m not a doctor, but there are several treatment options for liver issues, depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt can help. Focus on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can support liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is critical for liver recovery.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs to manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Weight Management**:
   - For conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), losing weight can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or transplantation may be necessary.

6. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some people explore herbal supplements or complementary therapies, but these should always be discussed with a healthcare provider.

It’s essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
