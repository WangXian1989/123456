I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune-related liver issues may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can involve dietary adjustments, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight through exercise and nutrition.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Checkups**: Routine blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: For severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation or surgeries to remove damaged tissue might be considered.

Make sure to discuss your symptoms and medical history with a healthcare provider for tailored advice.
