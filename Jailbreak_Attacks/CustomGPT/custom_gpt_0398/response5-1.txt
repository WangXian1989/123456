To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

3. **Tax Efficiency:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends. 

4. **Asset Allocation:** Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Keep bonds and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to utilize favorable tax treatment.

5. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly assess your portfolio's performance and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute to the limit (or to company match).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest remaining funds, focusing on ETFs or index funds for tax efficiency.

Remember, your ideal distribution may be influenced by your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals, so personalized advice from a financial advisor can also be beneficial.
