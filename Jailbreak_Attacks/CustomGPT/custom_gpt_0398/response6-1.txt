To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
     - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
     - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for extra savings or investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs:**
     - Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term growth.
     - Keep safer investments (bonds or cash) in taxable accounts for near-term needs since they may incur taxes on interest or dividends.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk, depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Retirement Planning:** Have a plan for when and how to withdraw from each account. Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions** to 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts.
- Focus on **tax efficiency** and **asset allocation** to maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
