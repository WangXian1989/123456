Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider putting money in a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), up to the annual contribution limit. This can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which generate fewer taxable events.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Distribute funds based on your current and expected future tax brackets. Pulling from tax-deferred accounts in retirement could be strategically beneficial.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across your accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust contributions and asset allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
