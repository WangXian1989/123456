Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax benefits and further diversify your tax situation in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you’re maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for additional flexibility. These accounts can provide easier access to funds if needed before retirement age.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) where gains can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or dividends) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account. For example, withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations according to the performance of your investments and changing financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to get personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
