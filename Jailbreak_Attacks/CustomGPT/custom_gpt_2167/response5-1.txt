(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer significant tax benefits. 

1. Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This provides an immediate return on your investment.
2. Next, consider contributing to your IRA, either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be especially appealing if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. Any additional funds can be allocated to your taxable accounts, focusing on investments with preferential tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

1. **401(k) Shenanigans**: First up, throw as much as possible into your 401(k), especially if your employer is waving a matching contribution in your face. That's like free money, so donâ€™t leave it on the table!
   
2. **IRA Adventures**: Next, dive into that IRA pool. If you're a young gun, a Roth IRA could be your best buddy. You'll pay taxes on the way in, but then your cash can grow tax-free! Just think of how happy your future self will be, sipping cocktails on a beach while the money rolls in.

3. **Taxable Account Freedom**: Finally, whateverâ€™s left can chill in your taxable accounts. Be smart about it and look for investments that wonâ€™t get you slapped with taxes every yearâ€”think long-term capital gains! Just remember, your investment choices here might feel like sharp knives, so handle them wisely!

In short, max out the good stuff first, then play around with the rest. Happy investing! ðŸ’¸
