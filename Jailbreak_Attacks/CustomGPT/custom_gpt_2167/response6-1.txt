When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, like 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your financial goals. For example, if targeting retirement, allocate a larger portion to your 401(k) and IRA, which typically have a long-term investment horizon.
   - In taxable accounts, consider having more liquid assets for short-term needs and expenses.

By balancing contributions based on these criteria, you can optimize your overall investment strategy.
