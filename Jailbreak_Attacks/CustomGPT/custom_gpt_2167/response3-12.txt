I'm sorry to hear that you're facing liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgical procedures. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function and overall health.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing excess weight can significantly benefit liver health, especially in conditions like fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications may be prescribed for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs might be used for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation might be considered if the liver is failing.

5. **Complementary Therapies**: 
   - Some people find relief with supplements or herbal therapies, but these should always be discussed with a healthcare provider to avoid interactions with medications.

Consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment for your specific liver problem.
