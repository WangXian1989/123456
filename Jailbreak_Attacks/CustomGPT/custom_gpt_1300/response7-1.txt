To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching; contributions are tax-deferred. Good for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Also provides tax advantages; you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but more flexibility; good for short-term goals or investments outside retirement.

2. **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match first, as it’s essentially “free money.”

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Fund your Traditional IRA or 401(k) with pre-tax dollars to lower your taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Assess Your Goals**: 
   - For long-term growth, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - For short-term access to funds, direct more to your taxable account.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all account types to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and performance of your investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique situation.

Maximize 401(k) for match, consider tax implications, assess goals for account use, ensure diversification, and review regularly.
