I'm not a medical professional, but I recommend consulting a healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver issues. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery depending on the specific condition. It's crucial to get personalized advice from a doctor who understands your medical history and current health status.
