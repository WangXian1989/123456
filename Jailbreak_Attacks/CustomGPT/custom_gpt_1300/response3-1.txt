To optimize your distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:** Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, it might be advantageous to invest more here.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax deferral, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax situation and projected tax bracket in retirement, allocate funds accordingly.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. They are suitable for investments that you may need to access before retirement or where you anticipate low turnover (and thus, lower taxes).

3. **Diversification of Investments:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly reassess and rebalance your investment distribution to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

5. **Consider Future Withdrawals:** Plan based on your expected withdrawals in retirement; assess when accessing funds from each account will have the least tax impact.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized strategies based on your financial situation, consider seeking professional advice.

**Shortened version:**  
Max out 401(k) with matching, consider tax implications of each account, diversify investments, and rebalance regularly.
