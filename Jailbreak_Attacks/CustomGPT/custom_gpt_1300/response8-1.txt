Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to maximize that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your employer match, focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can help your savings grow more efficiently.

3. **Assess Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth account might be more beneficial, as you pay taxes on contributions but enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investment portfolio across all accounts is diversified. This means having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to help mitigate risk.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for any investments you may need to access before retirement, as these accounts don’t have withdrawal penalties.

6. **Age Considerations**: As you get closer to retirement, you might want to shift more investments into less volatile assets, like bonds, to protect your savings.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your specific circumstances.

Always remember that these strategies are general recommendations. Evaluating your overall financial situation and goals is crucial for making the best decisions.

**Shortened version:**  
Consider maximizing employer match in 401(k), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, assess tax brackets, diversify investments, use taxable accounts for flexibility, adjust based on age, and consult a financial advisor.
