To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). If you exceed income limits for tax-deductible contributions, consider a Roth IRA instead.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before allocating large sums to retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Prioritize growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA, as these can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Keep more stable investments (bonds, cash equivalents) in taxable accounts, where capital gains taxes may apply.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Depending on your tax situation, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance growth potential.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and retirement goals.
