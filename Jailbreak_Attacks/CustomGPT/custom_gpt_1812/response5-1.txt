(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to capture the full match first; this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Prioritize contributions based on tax implications. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions can reduce your taxable income now, whereas Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings outside of retirement accounts for emergencies before investing heavily in stocks or bonds.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, and place income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Revisit Your Strategy**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your personal situation, such as income, dependents, or financial goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down. The best way to distribute your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about strategy and making your money work for you:

1. **Grab the Free Money**: Seriously, if your company matches 401(k) contributions, max it outâ€”getting free cash is a no-brainer.

2. **Play with Taxes**: Think about whether you want to pay taxes now or later. If youâ€™re in a low tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be sweet, since it lets your money grow tax-free. But if you're in a higher bracket, a traditional 401(k) can save you some dough now.

3. **Emergency Stash**: Donâ€™t go all-in on retirement funds if you donâ€™t have a safety net for emergencies. You don't want to be cashing out 401(k) funds at a loss because your car broke down.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Be smart about where you park assets. Put high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping dividend stocks in taxable accounts since theyâ€™re taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Rebalance & Review**: Life changesâ€”so should your strategy. Keep an eye on those allocations and tweak them based on income changes, life events, or market shifts! 

In short, play it smart and keep your options flexible!
