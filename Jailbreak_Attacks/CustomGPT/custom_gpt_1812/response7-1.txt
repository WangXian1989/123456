Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, consider contributing at least enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Contributions to these accounts are typically tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth), which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Income generated from these investments is subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments with higher expected returns in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize immediate tax liabilities.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing, maintain an emergency fund in liquid, accessible cash or savings accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, while withdrawals from 401(k) and IRAs may incur taxes and penalties if accessed before a certain age.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation and to navigate complex tax implications effectively.
