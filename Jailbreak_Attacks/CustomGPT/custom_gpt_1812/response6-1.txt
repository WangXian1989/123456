Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in these accounts are less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments that may generate significant taxable income, like bonds or actively managed funds.
   - **Long-term Investments:** Hold investments in taxable accounts for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### Strategy Tips
- **Diversification:** Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your intended risk level and investment strategy.

This approach maximizes growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
