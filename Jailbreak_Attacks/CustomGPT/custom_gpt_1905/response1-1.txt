To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if you can get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax rates, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains. These can also be more liquid for short-term needs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments within each account align with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, growth-oriented assets (stocks) can be beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can be suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized plan based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon can provide optimal allocation.

By maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first and maintaining a balanced investment strategy, you can enhance your long-term financial growth.
