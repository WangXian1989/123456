To best distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After maximizing any matching contributions, prioritize contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Focus on 401(k) Contributions:** Once your IRA contributions are optimized, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the legal limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last:** Use taxable accounts for excess savings. This allows for more liquidity and flexibility but consider the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Choose investments based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. Stocks may be suitable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable assets could be placed in taxable accounts to manage immediate cash needs.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal circumstances can vary greatly; tailored advice can lead to better outcomes.

This strategy will help optimize your tax efficiency and retirement savings.
