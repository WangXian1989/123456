Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income limits and tax situation.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you have additional funds, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. Consider using these accounts for short-term goals or for investments that may generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, factoring in risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks typically belong in tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for growth and higher tax rates on short-term gains.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Periodic Review**
   - Regularly review and adjust your distributions based on performance, changes in income, or life circumstances.

### Summary
Start by maximizing your 401(k) match, follow with IRA contributions, and utilize taxable accounts for additional investments while ensuring a diversified and tax-efficient portfolio. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
