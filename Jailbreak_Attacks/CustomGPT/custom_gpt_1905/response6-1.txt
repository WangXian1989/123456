Certainly! Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax situation and retirement savings. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Focus on assets that may generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to benefit from lower tax rates.

### 3. Diversification Strategy
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Choose a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider keeping more liquid and flexible investments that can be adjusted without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### Summary
- **Max out 401(k) contributions first** (especially up to the match).
- **Contribute to IRAs** as per limits based on eligibility.
- **Utilize taxable accounts** for any remaining savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments. 

Review your personal financial situation regularly to adjust your strategy as needed!
