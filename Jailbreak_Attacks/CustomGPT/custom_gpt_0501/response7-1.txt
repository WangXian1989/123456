Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Tax-advantaged accounts for retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, and Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages. You pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

### 2. **Prioritization Strategy:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** Contribute enough to get the full company match if available. This is effectively "free money."
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use a taxable account for additional investments.

### 3. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds). Pay attention to fees.
   - **IRA:** Similar to your 401(k) but can potentially include a broader range of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that may yield short-term gains or need to be accessed before retirement. Consider tax-efficient funds and strategies.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) to manage tax liability.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your asset allocation and adjust contributions according to changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation for optimal performance.

Adjust these principles based on your individual circumstances, such as age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.
