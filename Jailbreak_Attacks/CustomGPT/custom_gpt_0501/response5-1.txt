The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate funds across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts but adjust based on their tax implications.
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be beneficial in taxable accounts, as they usually generate lower distribution taxable income.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider the order of withdrawals based on tax implications. In retirement, it often makes sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Maintain your desired asset allocation by regularly rebalancing your portfolio across all accounts.

### 5. **Consider Your Age and Investment Horizon:**
   - Younger individuals might focus more on growth-oriented investments, while those nearing retirement may want to prioritize capital preservation and income.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal financial advice tailored to your specific situation can be invaluable.

#### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 50% (max out to take advantage of employer match)
- **IRA:** 25% (max out if possible)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 25% (for flexibility and emergency needs)

This strategy will help balance growth potential with tax efficiency.
