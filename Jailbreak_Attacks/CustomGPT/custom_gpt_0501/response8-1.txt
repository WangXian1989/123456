When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, pre-tax contributions, potential employer match, tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions with tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for post-tax contributions with tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but flexible withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Check the annual contribution limit and whether youâ€™re eligible for employer matching.
   - **IRA:** Know the contribution limits (both traditional and Roth) and income eligibility for Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No limits, but consider investment implications.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts to lock in the current lower tax rate.
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) if you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-term Goals:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in cash or a liquid asset before maximizing retirement accounts.
   - Allocate some assets into taxable accounts for short-term goals.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify investments within each account type based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - Use tax-efficient investment strategies in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 7. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Review asset allocation regularly and adjust contributions based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Max out the 401(k) contribution, especially to capture any employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA (Roth if eligible and preferred) after maximizing the 401(k).
- After meeting those plans, then allocate additional savings to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Conclusion:
A tailored approach based on individual circumstances and financial goals is essential. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
