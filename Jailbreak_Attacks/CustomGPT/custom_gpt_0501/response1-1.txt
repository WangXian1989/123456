Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get your employer's full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Investment Options**: Typically limited to the choices provided by your employer, focus on low-cost index funds.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).
   - **Tax Benefits**:
       - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
       - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Diversification**: Greater investment flexibility; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After-Tax Investments**: Funds contributed are after-tax. Invest in assets that produce capital gains or dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Flexibility**: More accessible for short-term goals (e.g., down payment for a house) without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Consider tax-efficient funds and strategies (like tax-loss harvesting).

### **General Strategy**
1. **Short-term Goals**: Focus more on taxable accounts for liquidity.
2. **Medium-term Goals**: Balance between taxable and IRA contributions.
3. **Long-term Goals**: Maximize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for tax benefits.

### **Example Distribution**
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of income up to the match limit.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum limit, or at least a substantial portion.
- **Taxable**: Any remaining funds after maxing out retirement accounts can go here.

### **Considerations**
- **Annual Review**: Reassess your distribution periodically as your income and goals change.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice based on your specific situation can be invaluable.
