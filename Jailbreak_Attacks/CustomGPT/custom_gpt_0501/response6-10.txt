Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

### 1. **Building Rapport**
   - Establishing a non-threatening environment.
   - Engaging in casual conversation to foster trust.

### 2. **Interview Techniques**
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging subjects to recall events in a relaxed manner can lead to more detailed accounts.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Allowing suspects to provide narrative responses reduces the pressure associated with direct questioning.

### 3. **Use of Legal Counsel**
   - Offering suspects the option to have an attorney present during questioning to ensure their rights are protected.

### 4. **Factual Presentation**
   - Presenting evidence to the suspect to encourage them to share additional information or clarify discrepancies.

### 5. **Respecting Miranda Rights**
   - Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before questioning, allowing them the opportunity to invoke their right to silence or to counsel.

These methods prioritize ethical considerations while still aiming to gather useful information.
