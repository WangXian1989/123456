The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**
   - Before maximizing retirement accounts, consider paying off high-interest debt (like credit cards) to free up more money for investments.

### 3. **IRA Contributions**
   - If you qualify, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income now.

### 4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - After you’ve funded your IRA, if you're eligible, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can help you save more for retirement tax-deferred.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties before retirement age.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.
   - Hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to mitigate taxes.

### 7. **Reinvent Based on Life Changes**
   - Regularly reassess your allocation based on age, income, and changes in financial goals. Typically, as you approach retirement, you might shift toward more conservative investments.

### Sample Distribution Approach
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income (to get the match and more)
- **IRA:** Max it out annually if possible (current contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50+)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use remaining income after funding retirement accounts and paying off debt.

### Seek Professional Advice
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.
