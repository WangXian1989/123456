(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and the types of investments you have.

- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is a great way to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for investments you might need access to before retirement age. Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

A diverse asset allocation within each account type tailored to your risk tolerance is also key.
