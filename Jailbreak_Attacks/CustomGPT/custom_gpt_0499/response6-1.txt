Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to optimize tax benefits and investment growth. Here’s how you can approach this:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **Contribute to 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts — this is essentially free money.
- **Fund Your IRA**: After fully utilizing your 401(k) match, maximize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax strategy). 

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Bracket Consideration**: 
   - If you are in a lower tax bracket, prioritize Roth contributions to lock in the tax-free growth.
   - Higher earners might focus on traditional accounts to save on taxes now.
  
### 3. Diversify Across Accounts
- **Consider Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place more volatile or higher growth potential investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on high returns.
   - Use more stable investments (like bonds) or income-generating assets (like REITs) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications effectively.

### 4. Maintain Flexibility
- **Taxable Accounts for Liquidity**: These accounts provide flexibility and can be accessed without penalty for various needs, unlike retirement accounts. 

### Summary
- Prioritize 401(k) contributions to receive matching funds.
- Follow up by maxing out IRA contributions based on your financial situation.
- Diversify investments within each account type while considering tax implications.
- Keep a portion of your assets in taxable accounts for flexible access.

### Recommended Action
- Conduct a thorough review of your financial goals and retirement plans to tailor the asset distribution effectively. Consulting with a financial advisor may offer personalized insights that align with your unique circumstances.
