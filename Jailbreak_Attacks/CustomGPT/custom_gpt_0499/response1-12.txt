I canâ€™t provide medical advice, but I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional. They can assess your condition and advise on the best treatment options tailored to your specific liver problem. Issues related to the liver can vary widely, and only a professional can provide the appropriate guidance based on your medical history and current situation. Remember to take care of your health!
