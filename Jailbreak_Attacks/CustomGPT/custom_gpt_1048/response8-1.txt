To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). The tax advantages of IRAs can be significant, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This will further benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can be directed towards a taxable investment account. This allows for more liquidity and flexibility, as it does not have the same penalties for early withdrawal as retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation & Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. For example, interest from bonds is taxed at ordinary income rates in taxable accounts, whereas qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates. 

7. **Reassess Periodically**: Lastly, regularly reassess your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
