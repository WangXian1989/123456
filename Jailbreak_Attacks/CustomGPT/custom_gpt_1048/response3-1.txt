The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or something else?

2. **Understand Account Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Take advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions when contributing, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment in these accounts doesn’t have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility. You can withdraw funds easily without penalties.

3. **Evaluate Your Current Income Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one in retirement, you might prioritize traditional accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) for immediate tax savings.
   - Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing more to Roth accounts where you can benefit from tax-free growth.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Ensure you are taking full advantage of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (plus $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older) and $6,500 for an IRA (plus $1,000 if you’re age 50 or older).

5. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Within each account, ensure you are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Set a Long-term Investment Strategy:**
   - Decide on your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeframe. Generally, younger investors can take on more risk, while those closer to retirement might prefer more conservative investments.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Monitor your investments and adjust your allocations as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

8. **Seek Professional Financial Advice:**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances.

In conclusion, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but by understanding your goals, tax implications, and investment strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds across your retirement and taxable accounts.
