To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money." Consider maximizing your contributions up to the limit for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Diversification**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider keeping more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Income Generation**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income, like bonds or dividend-paying stocks, since these can be taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Plan for Retirement**: Strategize how and when to withdraw funds from each account to minimize taxes during retirement. Aim to pull from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

By implementing these strategies, you'll optimize the growth potential and tax efficiency of your investments overall. Adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation and tax laws to ensure the best outcomes.
