To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if thereâ€™s a company match. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Only invest in taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Use these accounts for:
   - Investments that may generate qualified dividends (taxed at a lower rate) or long-term capital gains.
   - Money for short-term needs, as withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts early can incur penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diverse investment strategy based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Consider:
   - Higher-risk investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - More stable, income-producing investments in your taxable accounts to manage taxes efficiently.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your investment distribution. Rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to help develop a strategy tailored to your financial situation and goals.

Always stay informed on tax implications and changes in retirement account rules to optimize your strategy.
