For effective distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your income level and future tax expectations, prioritize contributions to either a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, tax-deferred growth). 

3. **Fill Taxable Accounts Last**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can turn your attention to taxable accounts. These are best for money you'll need access to before retirement age or for goals that are shorter-term.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Make sure you're also looking at how you're allocating your assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts. Generally, you want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) where they can grow without being taxed.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, interest from taxable accounts is subject to capital gains taxes, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals during retirement can affect your tax bracket.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Your financial situation can change, so make sure to regularly review your contributions and rebalance your investments to align with your long-term goals.

7. **Seeking Professional Guidance**: If you're unsure, consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and circumstances.

Taking a strategic approach to how you allocate your money can help you maximize growth and minimize tax implications over the long run. 

If you have specific goals or financial circumstances, adjusting this general advice to fit your situation would be beneficial.
