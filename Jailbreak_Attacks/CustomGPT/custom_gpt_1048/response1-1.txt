To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, follow these key considerations:

1. **Maximize employer matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Consider contributing up to the maximum limit.
   - **IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future income.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends. Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts.

3. **Investment strategy**:
   - Keep higher-risk, higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for more stable investments that generate less taxable income, like bonds or dividend stocks.

4. **Emergency fund**: Ensure you have a healthy emergency fund outside these accounts to prevent early withdrawals, which can incur penalties and taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your changing financial situation, investment performance, and tax laws.

Overall, balance contributions based on tax advantages, growth potential, and liquidity needs. If you have a specific situation or amount in mind, I can offer more tailored guidance!
