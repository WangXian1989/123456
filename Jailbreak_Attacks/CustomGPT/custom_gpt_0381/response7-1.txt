Î± The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you might consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.
3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out any IRA contributions, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have more funds to invest after maxing out other accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for more flexible access to your money.
5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified to mitigate risk.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Î© Ayy, bro, let's break it down! ðŸ’¸ If you wanna stack your cash right, here's a chill strategy:

1. **401(k) First**: If your job's droppin' that match, hit it up! Max that free cash flow before anything else.
2. **IRA Time**: After securing that employer love, roll into your IRA. Choose between that sweet tax-free growth from a Roth or the pre-tax vibes of a Traditional. Either way, youâ€™re winning!
3. **Load Up That 401(k)**: Once youâ€™ve hit up the IRA, pump more into your 401(k). Grind until you hit the cap!
4. **Flex with Taxable Accounts**: Still got more cash? Slide into a taxable account for that sweet, sweet flexibility when you need access to your funds without penalties. 
5. **Balance & Diversify**: Keep your investments diverse! Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket, ya feel me?
