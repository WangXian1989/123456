To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to at least get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially 'free' money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-term vs. Short-term**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (like stocks) and put more stable or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon; higher risk investments can be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

Adjust your contributions regularly as your income, tax situation, and retirement goals evolve. Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.
