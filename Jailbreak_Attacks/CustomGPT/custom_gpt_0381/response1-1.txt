Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: As of 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Prioritize this if you can.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you think your tax rate will be higher or lower in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50). If you can, try to max these out after your 401(k) contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to withdraw money without penalties and can be beneficial for short-term goals.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider investing in low-turnover index funds or ETFs here to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Recommended Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)**: Get the match first.
- **Max out an IRA**: Contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax outlook.
- **Fill up your taxable account**: Use this for anything beyond your retirement savings, especially if you expect to need funds before retirement.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly review and rebalance your allocation based on changes in your financial situation or investment performance.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, it's a balancing act and may be worth consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
