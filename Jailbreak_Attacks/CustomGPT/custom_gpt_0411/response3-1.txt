Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: This is typically employer-sponsored and allows pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income. Some employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: IRAs generally offer tax-deferred growth. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have the tax advantages of retirement accounts, but funds can be accessed without penalties. Capital gains from investments held longer than a year are taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match first. This is often the best return on investment available.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits. Choose between Traditional and Roth based on your current tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantage accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account for more flexibility.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or reduce capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts, as the tax treatment can be more favorable for these types of investments.

4. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Define your target retirement age and how much you wish to save. A longer timeline can allow more aggressive investments.
   - Consider other goals like buying a home or funding education, as these might influence how much you keep accessible in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation, especially for tax advice.

By diversifying your investments across these account types, you can take advantage of their unique benefits while planning for both your short-term and long-term financial needs.
