Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax and can lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement, making it great for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed when realized. Consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Allocate According to Your Risk Tolerance**
   - **401(k) and IRA Investments**: Typically, these are meant for long-term growth. Consider a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments with lower expected returns (like bonds) to manage tax impacts, or for more tax-efficient investments like index funds.

### 4. **Emergency Savings and Short-Term Goals**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using these accounts for short-term savings or investments if you anticipate needing the money before retirement.

### 5. **Long-Term Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Focus on a mix of growth-focused investments in your retirement accounts since these can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 6. **Diversification and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Max 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full company match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Fill up your Roth IRA (if eligible) or Traditional IRA next.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds here, focusing on a mix of growth and income-generating assets.

Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances.
