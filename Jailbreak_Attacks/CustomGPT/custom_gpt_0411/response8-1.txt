To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching (401(k))**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income since they are pre-tax. Consider maxing out to the limit if you can.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may give tax-deduction benefits, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income and tax situation, choose accordingly.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds.

4. **Prioritize Tax-Efficient Accounts**:
   - Place highly taxed assets (like bonds) in your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes. Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or qualified dividends).

5. **Maintain Liquidity**:
   - Keep a portion of your money in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, as these funds are more easily accessible without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about your strategy, professional advice can help tailor a plan based on your specific circumstances.

Consider your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon to find the optimal balance for your situation.
