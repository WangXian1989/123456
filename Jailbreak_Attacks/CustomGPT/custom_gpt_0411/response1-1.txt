Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general framework to guide you:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**  
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. It’s free money! Aim for the maximum contribution if you can.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). Roth IRAs are especially beneficial for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Asset Allocation**  
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that generate lower taxes—like long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds—in taxable accounts. Keep high-income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**  
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts can hold investments that will be taxed eventually. Consider bonds or real estate here.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for stocks you plan to hold long-term, as capital gains are taxed at a favorable rate.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**  
   - If you're saving for retirement, focus on longer-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you need access to funds sooner (like for a house or an emergency), ensure a portion is in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 5. **Diversification Across Accounts**  
   - Don’t concentrate your investments too heavily in one account. Diversify across all your accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Regular Rebalance and Review**  
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts to align with any changes in your financial goals or market conditions.

### Conclusion  
A balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged growth while maintaining liquidity and diversification is key. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
