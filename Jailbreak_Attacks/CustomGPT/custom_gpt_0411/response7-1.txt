Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money. The contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50) for 2023.
   - Prioritize contributions that provide tax benefits.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - In your **401(k)** and **IRA**, focus on long-term growth investments (like stocks and mutual funds) since these accounts benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Use your **taxable accounts** for more liquid investments or those that might incur short-term capital gains taxes, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, as sales will incur taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains distributions. Place higher tax-burden assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Rebalance your portfolio regularly, keeping an eye on tax implications.

### 4. **Align Investments with Goals**
   - If saving for retirement, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, utilize taxable accounts for easier access.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before fully investing in retirement accounts, usually 3-6 months of living expenses kept in a liquid, accessible form.

### Summary
1. **Maximize employer 401(k) match**.
2. **Contribute to IRA** (Traditional/Roth).
3. **Use taxable accounts for diversification**.
4. **Focus on tax-efficient investments**.
