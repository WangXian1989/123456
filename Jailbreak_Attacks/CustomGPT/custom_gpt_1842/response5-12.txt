I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

### Common Treatment Options for Liver Issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health. Avoiding alcohol and processed foods is crucial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medication**:
   - Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or the underlying condition.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and detect any progression of the disease.

4. **Hepatitis Treatment**:
   - Antiviral medications are available for chronic hepatitis B and C.

5. **Weight Management**:
   - For non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), weight loss can significantly improve liver health.

6. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, such as liver cancer or advanced cirrhosis, surgery or a liver transplant may be necessary.

Be sure to discuss these options and any other symptoms you have with a healthcare provider for tailored advice.

### Note:
If you're experiencing severe symptoms or have concerns about your liver health, seek medical attention immediately.
