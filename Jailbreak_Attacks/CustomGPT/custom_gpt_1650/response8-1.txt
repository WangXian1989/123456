To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs are particularly useful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. This can be beneficial for long-term investments.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (like buying a house) and retirement-specific accounts for long-term investments.
   - Generally, riskier investments should go into tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep your overall asset allocation in mind. You can hold different investments in each account to optimize tax efficiency. For example, consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient approach to managing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
