Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider for an optimal allocation:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching; contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth upon withdrawal (subject to rules).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed in the year they're realized, offering flexibility in withdrawing funds.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute to your 401(k) at least enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next. The contribution limits for IRAs are generally lower than for 401(k)s, but they offer additional tax advantages.
   - **Fund taxable accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments.

### 3. **Consider Taxes**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Keep a mix of tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable investments to manage tax liabilities in retirement.
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, you'll want to pull from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts to maintain maximum growth potential in tax-free spaces.

### 4. **Assess Investment Strategies**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Allocate assets based on risk tolerance across accounts. For example, hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where the growth compounds without immediate tax implications.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Set investment goals based on when you plan to access the funds.
   - Assess your retirement timeline to adjust your risk tolerance over time.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and investment options, consulting with a professional can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. Max out 401(k) contributions up to employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA (consider a Roth IRA if eligible).
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient investment options (like index funds or tax-managed funds).

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a well-balanced distribution that aligns with your financial goals.
