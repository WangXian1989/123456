Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Here are some generalized guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. You might consider contributing the maximum allowed ($22,500 for 2023, plus an extra $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. The contribution limits for IRAs are $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) for 2023.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts may be more advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are useful for investment flexibility and liquidity. Any interest, dividends, or capital gains realized here will be taxed, but they can be managed for tax efficiency.

### 3. **Build a Balanced Portfolio:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. The specific mix should align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary to stay on track with your retirement objectives.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your total contributions (max out to employer match).
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** 10-15% of your total contributions.
- **Taxable Account:** 10-20% of your total contributions after maximizing the above accounts.

### Conclusion:
It's generally best to prioritize maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts first before investing in taxable accounts. However, always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal circumstances and goals.
