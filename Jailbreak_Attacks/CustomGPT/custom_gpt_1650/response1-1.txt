To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money. This account offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax situation in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may lead to short-term needs or for tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for maximum tax benefits, especially if you're under 50 to take advantage of lower taxes now.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Fund your taxable account for purposes like buying a home or other short-term goals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets to reduce risk.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations across accounts to maintain your desired risk level and objectives.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering tax implications.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific situation and goals.
