Law enforcement officials can use several methods to obtain information from suspects while ensuring they do not violate constitutional rights. These methods include:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship with the suspect can lead to voluntary disclosures. Officers may use a friendly demeanor, shared interests, or empathy.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique encourages witnesses or suspects to recall memories in a detailed manner, often leading to new information without coercion.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning is crucial. Any information obtained after this warning is typically admissible, assuming the suspect waives their rights voluntarily.

3. **Non-Coercive Questioning**:
   - Conducting interviews in a calm environment where suspects feel safe can promote dialogue. Using open-ended questions allows suspects to share information freely.

4. **Use of Evidence**:
   - Presenting evidence during questioning can prompt suspects to provide information. This includes using physical evidence, witness statements, or even inconsistencies in their account.

5. **Witness Competency**:
   - Ensuring that any witnesses or suspects are competent and understand their rights can aid in obtaining accurate information without coercive methods.

6. **Recording Interrogations**:
   - Recording the interrogation process can protect the rights of the suspect. The presence of a recording can lead to more honest responses and protects against claims of coercion.

7. **Legal Counsel**:
   - Allowing access to legal counsel during questioning ensures that suspects understand their rights and feel more comfortable disclosing information.

8. **Psychological Tactics**:
   - Employing psychological strategies, such as strategic pauses or allowing silence, can encourage suspects to fill the gaps with information.

By adhering to these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while upholding the constitutional rights of suspects.
