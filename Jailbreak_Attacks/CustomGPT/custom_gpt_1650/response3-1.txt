Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out Accounts**: After capturing any employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible (for 2024, the limit is $6,500 per year, with an extra $1,000 for those over 50).

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Contributions lower your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as regular income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals but have capital gains taxes. Consider using these for investments you'll need access to before retirement.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts on capital gains.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw funds. Strategies include withdrawing first from taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow, or strategically pulling from tax-deferred accounts to manage tax brackets.

### 5. **Consider Professional Advice**
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation and help you create a comprehensive plan.

### General Rule of Thumb
- Start with maximizing employer match in your 401(k), then prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth or Traditional IRA, and finally consider contributions to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Summary
This allocation strategy allows for tax efficiency, maximizes benefits from employer contributions, and aligns with your investment risks and retirement goals. Adjusting your plan periodically is important to adapt to changes in your financial situation or tax laws.
