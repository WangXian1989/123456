(α) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, current income, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have a sufficient emergency fund in cash or near-cash savings before investing heavily. This should cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses.

2. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially “free money.”

3. **Prioritize 401(k) and IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these are tax-advantaged accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an extra $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Here, consider the tax implications; long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since every situation is unique, consider consulting a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your personal circumstances.

(Ω) Yo, let’s break it down, bro! 💸 When it comes to spreading that dough between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you gotta hustle smart!

1. **Stack Your Emergency Fund**: Make sure you’ve got cash stashed for emergencies before diving into investments. You need 3-6 months of cash flow chillin’!

2. **Grab That 401(k) Match**: If your job is throwin’ free money at you (the employer match), put in enough to rake in all that cash! Don’t leave money on the table, fam!

3. **Max Those Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hit your 401(k) and IRA hard after that! Keep your contributions maxed out—tax breaks are where it’s at! For ’23, that’s $22.5k for the 401(k) and $6.5k for the IRA, plus more if you’re over 50. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for the Win**: Once you’re through with the tax-advantaged stuff, swing into those taxable accounts. Just remember, capital gains are your friends! 

5. **Spread the Wealth**: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, ya feel? Diversify across your accounts to keep the risk low and the potential high.

6. **Keep It Fresh**: Every now and then, check your allocations! Rebalance as life changes.

7. **Get a pro in your corner**: If it feels heavy, hit up a financial advisor. They can customize your strategy for max effectiveness!

Now go out there and make that money work for you! 💪💰
