When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines to help optimize your investment strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). The IRA can provide tax benefits that may be more advantageous than a 401(k) if you qualify for Roth contributions.

3. **Return to Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and contribute up to the annual limit. This will help you maximize tax-deferred growth.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Distribute additional investments into taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. Keep in mind that investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so choose investments wisely (e.g., index funds or tax-efficient ETFs).

5. **Diversify Investments**: Diversify your asset allocation across your accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Different accounts may lend themselves to different investment strategies based on tax implications.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Consult Professionals**: Given the complexities of tax laws and individual situations, consulting a financial advisor or tax professional can help tailor a strategy that works best for you.

Always remember to consider your long-term goals and how each account type fits into your overall financial plan.
