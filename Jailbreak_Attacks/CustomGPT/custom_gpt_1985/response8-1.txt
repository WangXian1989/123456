The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement. 
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and eligibility rules. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling and any income generated (like dividends) is taxable in the year received.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressively investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and risk tolerance play a significant role. Younger investors might lean more towards stocks (higher risk/higher potential return), while those closer to retirement may want to allocate more to bonds (lower risk/lower return).

6. **Investment Goals**: Define your short-term versus long-term goals. Short-term savings might go into taxable accounts for easier access, while long-term savings could be better suited for retirement accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.

Ultimately, a balanced approach considering tax advantages, investment goals, and risk tolerance is key to effective distribution.
