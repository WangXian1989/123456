To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as they provide greater tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Equities, bonds, and other assets should be distributed appropriately among all accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from your 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, so balance investments based on your potential tax situation.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressively funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) set aside in accessible savings.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your financial situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

8. **Monitor and Adjust Contributions**: Life circumstances change; adjust your contributions based on income fluctuations, financial goals, and market conditions.

By carefully strategizing your contributions among these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
