Determining the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timelines, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline on how to approach the distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or non-deductible (Roth). However, Roth withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You will pay capital gains tax on any profits from investment sales, so consider keeping investments that appreciate modestly in these accounts to minimize taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Keep enough cash or liquid assets in taxable accounts to cover emergencies or short-term goals without tapping into retirement accounts.

4. **Long-Term Focus**: For long-term growth, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing heavily in taxable accounts, as these accounts can grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth accounts).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Younger investors might prefer growth-focused equities, while those closer to retirement may want a more conservative approach with bonds and stable investments.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your asset distribution based on changes in market conditions, tax law changes, or shifts in your financial goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation, working with a financial advisor can be beneficial.

By thoughtfully distributing your contributions and considering your unique financial scenario, you can optimize your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
