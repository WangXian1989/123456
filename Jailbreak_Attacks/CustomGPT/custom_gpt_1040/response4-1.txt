When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can lead to greater long-term growth.

2. **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money for your retirement. 

3. **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you have maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawing funds and can be beneficial for goals outside retirement.

5. **Investment Strategy:** Utilize a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and specific financial goals when selecting investments.

6. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. 

7. **Withdrawal Strategy:** When it comes time to withdraw funds, have a strategy for which accounts to draw from first, often starting with taxable accounts to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
