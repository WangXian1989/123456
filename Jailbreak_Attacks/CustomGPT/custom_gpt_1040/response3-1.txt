Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
- **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits**: Understand the annual contribution limits (for 2023, $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
- **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) plan and ensure they align with your investment strategy.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Treatment**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions but tax withdrawals, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
- **Flexibility**: IRAs can often provide a wider range of investment choices than 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Investment Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more investment options compared to retirement accounts.
- **Capital Gains Taxes**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit; holding investments for over a year can reduce tax rates.
- **Accessibility**: Funds in taxable accounts are accessible without penalties at any time, making them a good option for short-term goals.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund.
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start with enough contributions to get the employer match.
- **IRAs**: After the match, contribute to an IRA as it can provide tax diversification—consider a Roth IRA if you qualify.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or short-term goals once you max out tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Conclusion**
The appropriate distribution may vary based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial objectives. It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances. Consistently reviewing and adjusting your allocations over time as your situation changes is also crucial.
