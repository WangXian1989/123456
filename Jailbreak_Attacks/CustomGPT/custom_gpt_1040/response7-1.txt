Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), offering tax benefits based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide based on your current tax rate vs. expected future tax rate. Contribute to a traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now; consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

### 3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Unlike retirement accounts, there's no tax penalty for early withdrawals, which provides more liquidity.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, may be more suitable for taxable accounts.

### Recommendations
- **Prioritize**: Contribute to your 401(k) to get the employer match, then fund your IRA. After maximizing those, consider contributing to taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Tax Planning**: Consult with a financial advisor for strategies to minimize taxes, such as tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy varies based on individual circumstances, so it may be beneficial to periodically review your allocations as your financial situation changes.
