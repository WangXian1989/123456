Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a guideline to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after securing the match in your 401(k). IRAs often have more investment options and tax advantages.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** (Tax-deferred): Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA** (Tax-deferred): Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA** (After-tax): Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. They offer flexibility and no contribution limits.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Time Horizon**: If you have a longer time until retirement, you may consider aggressive growth investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts. For those close to retirement, a more conservative approach may be warranted.
   - **Asset Location**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification and Rebalancing**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation. 

5. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawing from a combination of accounts can help manage your tax liabilities each year.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Financial goals and situations change, so review and adjust your strategy regularly.

Ultimately, it’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.
