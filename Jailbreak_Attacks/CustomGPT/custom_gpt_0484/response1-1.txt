Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. If you’re currently in a lower tax bracket, contributing to these accounts may be more beneficial.
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for shorter-term goals and provide flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalty.

3. **Balance Between Accounts**:
   - After maxing out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings to taxable accounts. This method provides liquidity for emergencies or short-term goals.
   - Diversify your investments within each account type to optimize your risk and returns.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Within each account, consider your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - Keep in mind that capital gains taxes apply to taxable accounts, so it may be wise to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) in those accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and allocation as your circumstances change (income, expenses, goals).

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an approach specifically to your financial situation.
