Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible if you qualify) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement), depending on your income level and anticipated tax situation in retirement.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to reduce risk.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Investments in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, so consider placing investments that are likely to appreciate significantly in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Think about when you'll need the funds. Taxable accounts can provide liquidity if you need access to your money before retirement, while 401(k) and IRA funds are typically intended for retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - As you continue to invest, periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, helping you create a comprehensive strategy for wealth distribution among your accounts.

Consider your individual circumstances and current financial goals before making any decisions.
