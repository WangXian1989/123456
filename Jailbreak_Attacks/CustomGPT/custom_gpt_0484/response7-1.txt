Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money and is a great place to start.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and preference). These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your savings over time. 

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Conversely, if you're currently in a higher tax bracket but expect to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be advisable to defer taxes.

4. **Diversify Account Types**: Having a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts can provide flexibility in retirement when it comes to withdrawals and managing your tax burden. 

5. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Strategy**: The allocation of your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) might differ based on the account type and your risk tolerance. Typically, you might want to hold more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free for a longer period.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible account separate from these investment vehicles.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Keep an eye on your investments and the performance of your accounts. Adjust contributions and allocations based on your changing financial situation and goals. 

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By structuring your contributions strategically, you can optimize your retirement savings and investment growth.
