When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing this out if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Consider your current tax situation and expected tax situation in retirement when deciding.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are best for funds you may need in the short term and for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification**: Maintain a good mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts to help with risk management. Advantageously use your retirement accounts to hold more volatile investments (like stocks) since they have tax-advantaged growth potential.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. The performance and allocation across accounts may differ over time.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advised to start with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to connect with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically to your financial situation and goals.

Tailor your approach based on these factors, and adjust as your circumstances change over time.
