The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Contribute to Your 401(k) First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to start.

2. **Maximize Your IRA Contributions**: Once you are contributing enough to get the employer match in your 401(k), consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). IRAs typically have lower fees and more investment options.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. A Roth might be a better option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Diversify with Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This allows for greater flexibility, though you'll need to manage capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Younger investors might lean toward more aggressive growth investments, while those closer to retirement may prefer more conservative options.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your personal financial situation.

By following these steps, you can ensure a well-rounded approach to distributing your money among your retirement and investment accounts.
