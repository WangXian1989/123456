I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest some common approaches to liver health that you could discuss with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help. Reducing salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats is also beneficial.

2. **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water is essential for liver function.

3. **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight, which is crucial for liver health.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can prevent further liver damage.

5. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

6. **Regular Check-ups**: Monitoring your liver function through blood tests and imaging can help manage any problems early on.

7. **Supplements**: Some people find that taking certain supplements like milk thistle helps support liver health, but it’s important to consult with your doctor first.

Please consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
