To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first; contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Prioritize Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with lower expected tax burdens (e.g., index funds).

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-term Needs**: Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility without penalties.
   - **Long-term Growth**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term compounding.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - **Aggressive Growth**: Consider higher allocations in stocks within IRA/401(k).
   - **Conservative Approach**: Balance investments in bonds within taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you are aware of the contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax advantages.

By balancing your investments based on these criteria, you'll optimize potential returns while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
