When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, start by contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now. Consider contributing up to the maximum limit ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your tax situation, a Traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Try to contribute the maximum ($6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if you’re over 50) if you qualify for the Roth.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. Invest in lower-taxed assets like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure you have a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk.

5. **Liquidity Needs:** Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies since they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

6. **Long-Term Perspective:** Remember that retirement accounts have penalties for early withdrawal. Align your allocation with your long-term financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation and retirement goals.
