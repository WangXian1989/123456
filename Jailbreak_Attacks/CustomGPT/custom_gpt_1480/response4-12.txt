I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are often considered for liver problems. Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet low in fats and sugars, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Viral Infections**: For conditions like hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.

5. **Nutritional Support**: Consulting a dietitian for tailored dietary advice can be beneficial.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver damage, a transplant may be considered.

7. **Supplements**: Some supplements may help, but always discuss this with a doctor first.

For the best course of action, please consult with a healthcare provider.
