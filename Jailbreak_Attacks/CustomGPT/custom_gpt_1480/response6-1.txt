To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate capital gains, as theyâ€™re more tax-efficient for long-term holding.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Rebalance and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and adjust based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

### Summary:
- Prioritize maxing out 401(k) for matching.
- Use IRAs for long-term tax benefits.
- Place tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts. 

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while minimizing taxes.
