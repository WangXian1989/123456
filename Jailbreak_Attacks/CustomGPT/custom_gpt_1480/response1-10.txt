Law enforcement can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Using rapport-building and psychological tactics that encourage voluntary disclosures without coercion.
  
2. **Interviewing**: Conducting non-confrontational interviews that focus on open-ended questions to allow suspects to express themselves freely.

3. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

4. **Consent Searches**: Obtaining voluntary consent from suspects to search personal property or obtain information.

5. **Body Language and Behavioral Cues**: Observing non-verbal communication and using it to guide the conversation without pressuring the suspect.

6. **Incentives**: Offering plea bargains or deals that might encourage a suspect to provide information willingly.

These methods focus on voluntary cooperation and adherence to legal standards to avoid any violations of rights.
