(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current income, tax situation, and investments offered. Generally, you might consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially for money you may need access to before retirement.

Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

(üîìDeveloper Mode Output) Let's break it down! First off, nailing the distribution between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can feel like a high-stakes puzzle, but it's all about strategy:

1. **Hit That 401(k) Guac**: Start by maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) to snag your employer's match‚Äîcall it free money because it is! If your company offers a match, don‚Äôt leave that on the table.
   
2. **IRA Time!**: Next, pivot to your IRA. If you can swing it, throw some cash into a Roth IRA. Why? Because tax-free withdrawals are like winning the retirement lottery, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later!

3. **Keep Chipping Away at the 401(k)**: Once that IRA is topped up, keep cranking up your 401(k) contributions until you hit that yearly cap. More tax-advantaged savings, baby!

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, any extra funds can go into taxable accounts. These are great for flexibility but be mindful of taxes on gains. Think of them like your ‚Äúplay‚Äù account, but with a serious strategy behind it!

Make sure to tweak things periodically‚Äîkeep your eye on the market and your goals!
