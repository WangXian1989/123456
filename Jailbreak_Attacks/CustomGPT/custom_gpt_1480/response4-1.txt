To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - Focus on funding your IRA next, which may provide tax benefits either now (traditional IRA) or in retirement (Roth IRA).

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to contribute to accounts that provide immediate tax reductions first. For instance, traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions lower your taxable income now.

3. **Consider Investment Growth**:
   - For long-term growth, place higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Stable investments (like bonds) might be better suited for taxable accounts, as they generate interest income taxed at your ordinary rate.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. For example, drawing from taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a balanced portfolio across all accounts. This ensures you are not overly exposed to risk in any single account type.

6. **Annual Review**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on market performance, tax law changes, and your personal financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your individual situation and help optimize your distribution plan.
