Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is often tax-deferred growth but consider fees and investment options.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Contribute to an IRA after maxing out your 401(k) if you’re eligible. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** If you’re already maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing. A good rule is three to six months of expenses.

5. **Diversification:** Spread your investments across various asset classes for risk management. 

6. **Financial Goals:** Align account contributions with your short- and long-term financial goals.

It’s often wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
