Managing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term goals**: Favor equities in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term goals**: Keep more liquid and stable investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Optimize Asset Location**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Place higher-tax investments (like bonds and REITs) here to defer taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review your allocations regularly to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Be mindful of your current and expected future tax rates when choosing investment types for each account.

These steps will help ensure a balanced and tax-efficient investment approach.

### Summary
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**.
- **Align investments with your goals**.
- **Be strategic about asset location**.
- **Regularly rebalance your portfolio**.
- **Consider tax implications**.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
