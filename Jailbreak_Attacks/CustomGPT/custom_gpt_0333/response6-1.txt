To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages. This helps increase your savings faster.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for assets that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term vs. long-term goals. For retirement, lean towards tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term needs, use taxable accounts for flexibility.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Diversify investments within each type of account to balance risk.

4. **Contribution Prioritization**:
   - Consider employer matching in your 401(k) as a first priority. After maximizing this, contribute to your IRA. Any additional funds can go into taxable accounts.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your financial growth while managing tax implications.
