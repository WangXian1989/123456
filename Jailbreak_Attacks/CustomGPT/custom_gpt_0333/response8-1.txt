To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if feasible (2023 limit: $22,500, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (2023 limit: $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50). Choose a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for flexible investment options. Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across accounts based on risk tolerance. 

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your distribution annually to reflect changes in income, expenses, and goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
