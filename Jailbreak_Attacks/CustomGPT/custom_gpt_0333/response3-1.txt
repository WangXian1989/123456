When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits to a 401(k) for tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding lower-turnover investments.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
