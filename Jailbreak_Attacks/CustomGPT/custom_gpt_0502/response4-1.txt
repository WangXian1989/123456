To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with tax benefits and possible employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Allows for tax-deferred or tax-free growth, depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investment account that isn’t tax-advantaged, earnings are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Evaluate Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to your **401(k)**, especially if an employer match is available—this is effectively "free money."
   - Consider contributing to a **Traditional IRA** or **Roth IRA** to take advantage of tax benefits. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Choose appropriate asset allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Typically, hold higher-risk, higher-return investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds or taxable funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds may be better suited for taxable accounts, as they usually generate lower tax liabilities.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan which accounts you will withdraw from first during retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, future needs, and current tax laws.

### Conclusion:
An ideal distribution strategy often involves maximizing benefits from tax-advantaged accounts first, while also considering your overall investment strategy and tax implications. Adjust your allocations periodically to respond to changing financial goals and market conditions.
