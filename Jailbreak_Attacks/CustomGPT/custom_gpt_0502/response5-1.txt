Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income, financial goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA after maxing out your 401(k) match. Use a traditional IRA if you want a tax deduction now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: Max out your contributions if you can (currently $22,500 for 2024, plus $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Consider Emergency Savings**
   - Maintain 3 to 6 months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible account to cover unexpected expenses.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Shorter-Term Goals**
   - Any investment funds you may need in the next 5-10 years should be held in taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity for goals like buying a home or funding education.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Revisit your allocation annually to adjust for life changes, market performance, and shifts in your financial goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 50% of your total retirement savings
- **IRA**: 30% 
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

This strategy ensures you're maximizing tax advantages while keeping liquidity for short-term needs and maintaining a diversified investment portfolio. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
