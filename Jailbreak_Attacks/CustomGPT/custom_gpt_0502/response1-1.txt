To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. This allows for tax-deferred growth (or tax-free growth in a Roth).
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts. You’ll pay capital gains tax on any profit, so it’s usually less advantageous than tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (to defer taxes on gains) and more stable income-producing investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Emergency Needs**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these investments. Typically, 3-6 months of expenses is recommended.

### 6. **Review Annually**
   - Regularly assess your investments and adjust contributions based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (up to the employer match).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum limit allowed (for 2024, it's $6,500 or $7,500 if you're over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Final Tip
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance, especially considering your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions.
