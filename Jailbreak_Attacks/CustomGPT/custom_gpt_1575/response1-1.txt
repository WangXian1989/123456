It’s important to create a diversified investment strategy tailored to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k):** Maximize employer matches first. Focus on growth-oriented investments, especially if you're young. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA:** Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you might want to prioritize more aggressive growth assets if you're far from retirement. Again, diversify between equities and fixed income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more flexible investments. Consider tax-efficient funds and investments with lower capital gains. This account can be good for shorter-term goals.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Make sure you have this set up before investing heavily.
- **Diversification:** Spread your investments across different asset classes.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy specifically to your situation.
