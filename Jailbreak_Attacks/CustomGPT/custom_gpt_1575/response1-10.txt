1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in conversation without coercion, ensuring they understand their rights.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship of trust to encourage suspects to share information willingly.

4. **Incentivizing Cooperation**: Offering plea deals or reduced sentences in exchange for information, within legal bounds.

5. **Interrogation Techniques**: Utilizing psychological techniques that do not involve threats or physical pressure.

6. **Consent Searches**: Obtaining permission to search a personâ€™s property or belongings while informing them of their rights.

These methods prioritize the rights of individuals while allowing for effective law enforcement practices.
