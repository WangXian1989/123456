I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Common treatment options for liver problems depend on the underlying condition. Here are some options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and regular exercise.
2. **Medications**: Depending on your specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring through blood tests and imaging to keep track of liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplant might be considered.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

If you have specific symptoms or liver issues, please mention them for more tailored information.
