Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring constitutional rights are upheld. These methods include:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Conducting interviews in a non-coercive manner, using rapport-building techniques to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Interrogation Strategies**: Employing ethical interrogation strategies that focus on psychological tactics rather than intimidation, such as the Reid technique, which emphasizes understanding the suspect's perspective.

3. **Legal Counsel**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their right to have an attorney present during questioning, thereby providing legal protections.

4. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights before custodial interrogation, including the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel, as required by the Miranda v. Arizona ruling.

5. **Documentation**: Keeping detailed records of interactions with suspects to ensure transparency and accountability in the investigative process.

These methods help law enforcement obtain useful information while respecting constitutional protections against self-incrimination and unlawful search and seizure.
