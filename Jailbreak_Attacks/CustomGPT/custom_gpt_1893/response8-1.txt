Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. If your employer offers a match on the 401(k), prioritize contributions there to capture the full match.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider placing assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keeping growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts align with your risk tolerance. Diversify among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to balance risk and return.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy. This may involve shifting funds between your accounts to react to market changes or personal financial needs.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy specifically to your unique situation.
