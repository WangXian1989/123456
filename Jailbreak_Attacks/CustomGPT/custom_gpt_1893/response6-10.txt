Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring they respect constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques:**
   - Use rapport-building techniques to foster communication.
   - Implement the PEACE model (Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure, and Evaluate).

2. **Voluntary Interviews:**
   - Conduct voluntary interviews where suspects can choose to talk without coercion.
   - Clearly inform suspects of their rights, including the right to remain silent.

3. **Intelligent Questioning:**
   - Ask open-ended questions to allow suspects to provide detailed answers.
   - Utilize active listening skills to encourage dialogue and gain trust.

These methods focus on ethical engagement, ensuring that constitutional rights are upheld throughout the process.
