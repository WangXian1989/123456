(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider funding your IRA for additional tax advantages. If you're already maximizing these accounts and have extra funds, you can allocate it to a taxable account. This staged approach ensures you're taking full advantage of tax-deferred growth opportunities while maintaining some liquidity in your taxable accounts for short-term needs.

Then, toss some dough into an IRA (Roth or traditional, depending on your tax vibe) because who doesnâ€™t want tax breaks? Once you've maxed those out, feel free to let loose in a taxable account. Youâ€™ll have some control with your money there, plus some fun investment options. Just remember: balance risk and returns like it's a game of financial dodgeball. Stay smart, and keep an eye on taxes!
