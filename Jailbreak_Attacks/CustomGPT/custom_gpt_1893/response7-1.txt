To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. These accounts provide tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term savings. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider adding funds to your taxable accounts. These accounts provide more investment flexibility, though you will be liable for capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. For instance, consider holding more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts for potential tax-free growth, while placing more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
