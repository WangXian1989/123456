Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts provide tax benefits.

2. **Prioritize account types**: Place investments with high growth potential, such as stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA), where they can grow tax-deferred. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate taxable income (like bonds or certain funds).

3. **Manage tax impacts**: Be mindful of tax implications. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, while tax-deferred accounts aren’t taxed until withdrawal.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
