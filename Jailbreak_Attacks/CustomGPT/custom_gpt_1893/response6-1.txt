To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Keep emergency funds and short-term savings in these accounts.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure diverse asset allocation across all accounts, balancing risk and return based on your age and investment timeline.

By following these steps, you'll effectively balance growth potential while managing tax implications.
