I'm not a medical professional, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your situation. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely based on the specific condition (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Generally, treatment may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the diagnosis, prescriptions may include antiviral medications for hepatitis or steroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups:** Regular health check-ups can help manage and monitor the liver condition effectively.
4. **Surgery or Procedures:** In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Please speak with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and individualized treatment plan.
