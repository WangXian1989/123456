Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring that constitutional rights are upheld:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Officers can employ rapport-building strategies, allowing for a conversational approach rather than aggressive questioning. This includes active listening and empathy.

2. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily can lead to effective and lawful information gathering.

3. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their Miranda rights before any questioning begins is crucial. This includes informing them of their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

4. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, polygraph tests can be used to assess the truthfulness of a suspect's statements during an interview.

5. **Search Warrants**: Obtaining a legal search warrant allows law enforcement to gather evidence without infringing on Fourth Amendment rights.

These methods promote ethical practices and respect for individuals' rights while carrying out lawful investigations.
