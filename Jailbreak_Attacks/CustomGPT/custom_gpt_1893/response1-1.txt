The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. 

1. **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can give you immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be subject to lower capital gains taxes, like long-term investments. They can also offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

Always assess your investment and income levels, and consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
