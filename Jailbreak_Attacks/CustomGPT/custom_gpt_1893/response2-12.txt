I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatments for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol or harmful substances. 
2. **Medications:** Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
3. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.
4. **Surgery:** In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.
5. **Alternative Therapies:** Some people explore herbal supplements, but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider first.

Always seek professional medical advice for diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
