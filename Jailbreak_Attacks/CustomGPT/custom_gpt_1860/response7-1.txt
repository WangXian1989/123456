Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
- **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
- **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices and fees associated with your 401(k).

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
- **Tax Benefits**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can gain tax advantages. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).
- **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs may offer broader investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Brokerage Accounts**
- **Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement, or for short-term goals.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Flexibility**: Unlike retirement accounts, there are no contribution limits or early withdrawal penalties.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a liquid account.
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
- **IRA Contributions**: After taking advantage of your 401(k) match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions.
- **Taxable Account**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out retirement accounts, allocate money to a taxable brokerage for more liquidity and flexibility.

### Considerations
- **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors may prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might favor preserving capital.
- **Tax Bracket**: High-income earners may benefit from Traditional accounts to lower taxable income now, while lower-income years may favor Roth accounts.
