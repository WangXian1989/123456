Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if availableâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

2. **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Investment Choices**: Use IRAs for investments you anticipate holding long-term, benefiting from tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Opt for investments with lower tax implications, like index funds or ETFs.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse portfolio to balance risk.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Account Types**: Contribute to 401(k) up to the match, max out IRA contributions, and then allocate excess funds to your taxable account.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocation and rebalance as needed based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique circumstances.
