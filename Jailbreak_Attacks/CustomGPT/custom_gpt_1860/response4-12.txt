I can't provide medical advice or treatment options directly. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific liver problem. They can recommend the best course of action based on your medical history and current condition. If you need general information about liver health or treatment options, I can help provide that!
