Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from tax efficiency, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.
   - Keep in mind capital gains tax implications when trading or selling investments within these accounts.

3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and keep long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Retirement Focus**: Focus more funds in tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, where the growth can be tax-deferred or tax-free.

4. **Evaluate Risk Tolerance**:
   - Adjust the allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy across all accounts for a balanced portfolio.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance, contributions, and any changes in financial goals or tax laws.

**Summary**:
- Max out employer 401(k) contributions for matching.
- Prioritize contributions to IRAs after 401(k) match.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility or short-term goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal situation.
