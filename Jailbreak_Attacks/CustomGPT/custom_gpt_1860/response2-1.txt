To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free" money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute the maximum you can, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - For short-term goals (5 years or less), use taxable accounts, which provide liquidity.
   - For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts, which can compound without immediate tax implications.

4. **Consider Investment Options:**
   - Use your 401(k) for a diversified portfolio of index funds and target-date funds, usually with fewer options but lower fees.
   - Use an IRA for a broader range of investments, including individual stocks or ETFs.
   - Invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility and potentially lower capital gains taxes if you invest for the long term.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly assess your investment performance and risk tolerance, adjusting contributions and allocations as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific goals and financial situation.
