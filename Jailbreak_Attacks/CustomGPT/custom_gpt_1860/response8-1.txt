Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax bracket, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. In 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50+).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Focus on a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. This may involve holding stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your investment strategy.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - For money you want to access before retirement or for short-term goals, keep investments that may generate high tax liabilities (like stock funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) or for cash reserves.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Adjust contributions as necessary based on performance and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to create a personalized investment strategy that considers your unique situation and goals.

By taking these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize for growth and tax efficiency.
