Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Typically, it’s a good idea to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts often provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, depending on the account type.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into an IRA. This is essentially free money!

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. This helps mitigate risk and can lead to better long-term performance.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These may be suitable for investments you might need to access in the short term or for investments that generate taxable income (like dividends). Aim for tax-efficient investments here.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are better for long-term growth, as withdrawals are taxed (401(k)) or tax-free (Roth IRA).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, your asset allocation may drift due to market performance. Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement, you might want to shift your allocation towards more stable, less risky investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider seeking advice from a certified financial planner.

Align your strategy with your overall financial goals and life circumstances, and you’ll be on the right path!
