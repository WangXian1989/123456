When deciding how to allocate your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on maximizing employer matches here first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** For Traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your expected future tax bracket when choosing.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains taxes, making them suitable for investments that may appreciate significantly or for shorter-term goals.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term retirement savings, while keeping taxable accounts for more flexible, shorter-term investments.

3. **Risk Tolerance:**
   - Balance your risk across all accounts based on your overall investment strategy.

4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Keep in mind the contribution limits for each account type. Max out employer matches, then consider IRAs.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, tailored to your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Creating a higher contribution level in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial, while reserving some assets for liquidity and flexibility in taxable accounts may also help. Consulting a financial advisor specific to your circumstances can also provide personalized guidance.
