Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money).
     - Aim to maximize contributions if your employer offers a high match.
   - **IRA:**
     - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions based on income levels.

### 2. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use these for goals that are shorter-term or if you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts.
     - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities.

### General Guidelines:
- **Equities vs. Bonds:** Put more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains.
- **Rebalance as Needed:** Regularly reassess your allocation to maintain your desired risk level and goals.

### Consulting a Professional:
- It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for tailored guidance, especially regarding contribution limits and tax implications.

This structured approach can guide you in building an effective investment strategy across your various accounts.
