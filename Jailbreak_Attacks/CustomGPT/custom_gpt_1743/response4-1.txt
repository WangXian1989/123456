To optimize your distribution of money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to the maximum limit if possible, especially if your 401(k) has low fees and good investment options.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If youâ€™re eligible for a traditional IRA, it can provide tax deductions in the year you contribute, reducing your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.
   - Keep higher-yield investments, which might generate short-term capital gains, in your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification and Risk**:
   - Ensure that your overall investment is diversified across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Annual Contributions Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Considering your personal financial situation and goals, getting advice tailored to your circumstances can be beneficial.

This approach helps maximize tax advantages and growth potential across all types of accounts.
