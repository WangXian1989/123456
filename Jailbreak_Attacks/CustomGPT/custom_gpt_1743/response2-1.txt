Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Consider your tax situation; Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you can, continue to contribute the maximum to your 401(k). This can lower your taxable income and grow tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account for flexibility and access. Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the key is balancing tax efficiency, growth potential, and your liquidity needs.
