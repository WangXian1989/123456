I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you have liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition you're dealing with. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, surgery. It's critical to follow your doctor's advice for tailored treatment. Please seek medical help for accurate guidance.
