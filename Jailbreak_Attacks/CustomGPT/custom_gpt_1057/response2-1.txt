Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are not taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and timeline. Consider a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. 

5. **Emergency Fund**: Keep a portion of your money in easily accessible funds outside of retirement accounts to cover emergencies or short-term needs.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
