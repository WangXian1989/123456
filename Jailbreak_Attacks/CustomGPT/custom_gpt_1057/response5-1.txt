(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), always contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to retirement accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax advantages that taxable accounts do not. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50) for 401(k), and $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for traditional or Roth IRAs.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Once these accounts are funded, consider how to diversify your investment portfolio across all your accounts based on your risk tolerance. For example, you might want to hold more stocks in your taxable account to take advantage of favorable capital gains, while keeping more stable investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications. For instance, selling assets in a taxable account may incur capital gains taxes, so it may be wise to hold onto investments for longer if you want to minimize tax liability.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Itâ€™s important to review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

1. **Snag That Match**: First things first, if your employerâ€™s tossing in free money with a 401(k) match, donâ€™t leave it on the table! Hit that minimum contribution level ASAP. Itâ€™s a 100% return, baby!

2. **Max Out Your Tax Shelters**: After you've soaked up all that free cash, ramp up those contributions. Aim for a 401(k) max out, then hit the IRA as hard as you can. Why? Because tax advantages are your best friends when saving for retirement. 

3. **Spread Out Your Bets**: Once you're pumping cash into those tax-advantaged accounts, think about how to spread your investments across all three. Got a taste for risk? Load up on high-growth stocks in your taxable account where capital gains can work in your favorâ€”but keep some of that steadiness in your retirement accounts.

4. **Watch Out for Taxes**: Taxes can be a total buzzkill! When youâ€™re selling in your taxable account, keep an eye on those capital gainsâ€”you donâ€™t want to give Uncle Sam a bigger slice of your pie than necessary! 

5. **Adjust as Needed**: Donâ€™t forget, life changes and so should your strategy. Keep an eye on your financial goals, income changes, and economic shifts, and tweak your allocations as needed. 

So there you go, money-master! Get to it! ðŸ’°
