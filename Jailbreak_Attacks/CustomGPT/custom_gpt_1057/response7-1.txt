The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are general guidelines to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize your contributions if you can afford it, since 401(k) accounts often have higher contribution limits than IRAs.
   - Choose investment options that align with your retirement timelineâ€”typically a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If you're eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Diversify your investments within the IRA similar to the 401(k), but remember that you have more investment options generally available with an IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - This should be used for savings goals outside of retirement, such as buying a home or funding education expenses.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable distributions.
   - Keep in mind that capital gains taxes can impact your net returns, so strategically selling assets can help manage tax implications.

**Considerations:**
- Balance your contributions based on your tax bracket, investment options, and financial goals.
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation, especially for tax implications and long-term planning.

By strategically distributing funds across these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and minimize taxes while working towards your financial goals.
