Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (if applicable)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and an excellent way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you may get tax deductions on contributions (Traditional) or tax-free growth and withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices without penalties.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses. This fund should typically be kept in a savings account or other low-risk, easily accessible accounts.

4. **Investment Horizons**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed sooner.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to spread risk. Keep in mind each account's tax implications when determining your investment mix.

6. **Review Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial. If you anticipate being in a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may provide immediate tax benefits.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your distribution and investment strategy to ensure it aligns with changing financial situations, goals, and market conditions.
