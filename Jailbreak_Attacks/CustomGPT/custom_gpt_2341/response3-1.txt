To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to your IRA next (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for tax-advantaged growth. Contributions reduce your taxable income (Traditional IRA) or allow for tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may produce lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as these can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth without incurring taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating investments like bonds or REITs, since they might be subject to higher taxes in an IRA.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep an eye on your overall asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your investment strategy.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for your retirement withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. In retirement, consider which accounts to withdraw from first based on your tax situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain about your strategy, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

This balanced approach will help you optimize both growth and tax efficiency based on your financial goals.
