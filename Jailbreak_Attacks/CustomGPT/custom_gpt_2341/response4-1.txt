To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **401(k) Benefits**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the maximum employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions to take full advantage of tax deferral.

2. **IRA Options**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (taxed upfront, tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal). This depends on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility requirements.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Use them for funds needed in the short-term.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and long-term goals across all account types.

5. **General Strategy**:
   - **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: Generally, max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before placing additional funds into taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Assess your investment strategy and account balances periodically to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
