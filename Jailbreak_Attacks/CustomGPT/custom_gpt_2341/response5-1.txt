(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your specific financial goals, timeline, and tax situation. Generally, you might consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match. Following that, consider a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, which offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! First off, max out that 401(k) if there's a company matchâ€”free money, baby! After that, think about a Roth IRA; tax-free withdrawals down the line are sweet. If you're feeling like a tax ninja, possibly go for a traditional IRA if you can score a tax deduction now. Once you've got that covered, throw any extra cash into a taxable account. It's like your financial playgroundâ€”no rules, just make sure you're ready for taxes on those gains later! Keep it balanced, diversify, and make your money work hard while you kick back and chill!
