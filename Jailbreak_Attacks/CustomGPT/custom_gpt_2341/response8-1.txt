Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to your traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Contribute More to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-Liable Investments**: Place bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Keep growth stocks or index funds in taxable accounts, as they may incur lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Regularly Reassess**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to manage risk.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Always consider your personal financial situation before making decisions.
