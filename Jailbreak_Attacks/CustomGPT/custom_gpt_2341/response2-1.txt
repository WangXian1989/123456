To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Good for high-income years since contributions lower your taxable income. Withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Best for lower-income years or if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Account:** Use for short-term goals or when you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth options (stocks, index funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use more tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds) and geographies within all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions, tax law changes, and your financial goals, adjusting contributions as needed.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund in a liquid account before focusing too heavily on investments.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial, considering your unique circumstances.
