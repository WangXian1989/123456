To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: After maxing the 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. Asset Allocation
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Hold investments that appreciate in value (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, allowing for tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
- **Income-Generating Assets**: Use taxable accounts for investments generating regular income (like bonds or dividend stocks) to manage tax implications more effectively.

### 3. Withdrawal Strategy
- **Early Withdrawal Penalties**: Avoid withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts until retirement age to prevent penalties and maximize growth.

### 4. Rebalancing
- **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your investment allocation relative to your risk tolerance and market conditions. 

### Conclusion
Implementing a thoughtful strategy, focusing on maximizing tax advantages while considering your overall financial goals, can lead to more effective wealth accumulation.
