Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as income later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are earned, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income or short-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how your withdrawal strategy will impact taxes in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly from Roth accounts to minimize tax burdens.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out to company match.
- **IRA (Roth/Traditional)**: Contribute up to the max limit based on eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for investing in a diversified portfolio.

### Regular Review
- Annually reassess your distributions and adapt your investment strategy as your financial situation and goals change.

By following this structured approach, you can optimize your investments across different account types for maximum growth and tax efficiency.
