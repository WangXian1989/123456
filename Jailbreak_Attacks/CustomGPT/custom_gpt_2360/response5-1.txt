Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get your employer’s match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), so consider which option aligns with your tax strategy.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Diversify Tax Treatment**: If you have room in your budget, contribute to an IRA for additional tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth) growth.
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits and eligibility for Roth IRAs based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for flexible goals (like buying a house) since you can access the money without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the investment types based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain a cash reserve for unexpected expenses before heavily investing.

Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on performance, changes in income, and shifts in financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor could also provide personalized insights.
