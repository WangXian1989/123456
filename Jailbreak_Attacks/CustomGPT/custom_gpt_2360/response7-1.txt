Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your current taxable income, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be better; if you expect to be in a higher bracket, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility; you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but you can access funds without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts but consider tax efficiency:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Keep bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts if they generate higher ordinary income.

5. **Rebalancing and Contributions**: Regularly assess and adjust your contributions based on market performance and any changes in your financial situation.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your retirement goals, targeting a mix of growth and income based on your risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can personalize this strategy further based on your unique circumstances.
