Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before investing, ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses in a liquid savings account for emergencies.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum each year if you can. For 2023, that’s $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is suitable for savings goals within the next 5-10 years, as earnings here are subject to capital gains tax.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors might lean more toward stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds.
   - **Location Optimization**: Place higher-taxed income-generating investments (like REITs or bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-taxed investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation regularly (at least annually) and adjust contributions as needed based on changes in your income, expenses, or financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can be extremely valuable, especially for tax strategy and investment choices.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 50%

This distribution can be modified based on your specific situation and goals.
