Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should typically consider your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts grow tax-free (Roth IRA) or tax-deferred (traditional IRA and 401(k)).

3. **Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: As of 2023, $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

5. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **traditional IRA** contributions may provide immediate tax deductions, but taxes will apply when you withdraw.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - For taxable accounts, capital gains taxes may apply, so consider long-term vs. short-term investments.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts before heavily investing.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay in line with your goals and risk tolerance.

In essence, bolster your retirement accounts first for tax benefits, then allocate any excess funds to taxable accounts while keeping an eye on your overall investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
