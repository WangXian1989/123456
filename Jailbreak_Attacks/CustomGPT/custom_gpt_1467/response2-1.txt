I'm here to help with medical education and concepts, but for questions specifically related to personal finance and investing, including the distribution of money among retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, I recommend consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals. If you have any questions related to medical subjects or concepts, feel free to ask!
