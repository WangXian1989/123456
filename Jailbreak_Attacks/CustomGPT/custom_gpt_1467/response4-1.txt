I'm here to help clarify your understanding of financial concepts related to retirement accounts, but I can't provide personalized financial advice. Generally, the best strategy for distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy.

1. **401(k)**: This is often a good place to start, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Contributing enough to get the full match is usually considered a priority since it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your tax situation, you might want to consider maxing out contributions to an IRA after taking advantage of your 401(k) match. A Traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. This option gives you more control over your investments and how you withdraw them. Keep in mind that you'll be subject to capital gains taxes on profits when you sell assets in taxable accounts.

It's important to evaluate your overall financial situation, including income level, future financial goals, and how close you are to retirement. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
