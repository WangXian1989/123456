Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (Traditional or Roth) for tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term, or for investment options not available in retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Hold growth assets like stocks to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider bonds or other income-generating assets, as they are taxed at your income tax rate.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you get closer to retirement, shift more assets to safer investments to preserve capital.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
