Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions (up to $22,500 for 2023, with an additional $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (up to $6,500, or $7,500 if age 50+) if eligible.

### 3. **Taxable Investment Accounts:**
   - Once you’ve maxed tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for flexible withdrawal if needed.

### 4. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Place higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) and more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts might be more beneficial. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, Roth accounts are preferable.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, and changes in tax laws.

### Additional Considerations:
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
- Keep emergency savings and short-term needs in mind separate from retirement investments.

This approach helps balance tax efficiency and investment growth tailored to your goals.
