Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable to your 401(k) and IRA first. This helps you benefit from tax deferral and potential employer matches.
   - **Consider Roth Options**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket Considerations**: If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions to lower your taxable income.
   - **Future Tax Expectations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider more contributions to Roth accounts.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep some liquid funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and emergencies.
   - **Invest for Shorter-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments with a shorter time horizon or for funds you might need sooner.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced allocation across accounts. Typically, more aggressive investments can go in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments are suitable for taxable accounts.

### 5. **Continuous Review**
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and goals.

### Conclusion
Seek to maximize tax-advantaged accounts initially, understand your tax implications, and maintain a flexible strategy with taxable accounts. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
