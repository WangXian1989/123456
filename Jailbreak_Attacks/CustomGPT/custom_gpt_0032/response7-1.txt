Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize IRAs**: After the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, as they often offer tax advantages for retirement savings.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you can, contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) after fully funding the IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments if you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance, life changes, and financial goals.
