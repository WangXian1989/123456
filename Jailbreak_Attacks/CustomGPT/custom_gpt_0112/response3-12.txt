I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease, medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider for the best treatment options tailored to your situation.
