The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Implications**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Earnings may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income depending on your income bracket.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k) Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to at least match employer contributions.
2. **Fund IRA**: Depending on your income, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings beyond retirement accounts or for short-term goals.

### Ongoing Review:
- Regularly review your asset allocation, investment performance, and contribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
