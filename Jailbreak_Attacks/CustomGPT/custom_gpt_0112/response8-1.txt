Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Consider maxing out your contributions after utilizing the IRA, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This is ideal for funds you might need before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Place stocks and high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Income-Producing Investments**: Place bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Regular Review**: Review your allocation annually to adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
