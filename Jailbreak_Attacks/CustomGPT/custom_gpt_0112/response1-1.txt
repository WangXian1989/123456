Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Traditional accounts offer tax deductions upfront, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for money you might need before retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth with a diversified mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but consider the flexibility of investment options available in IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualify for tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing. This fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Consult with a tax advisor for personalized strategies, considering your specific tax bracket and other factors.

A balanced approach tailored to your unique situation will serve you best.
