Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - **Consider High Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diversified portfolio available in your plan.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Great if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for short-term goals or to access funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies like holding for long-term capital gains.

### **Overall Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes in all accounts.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations to adjust based on performance, life changes, or financial goals.

### **Consult a Professional**
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
