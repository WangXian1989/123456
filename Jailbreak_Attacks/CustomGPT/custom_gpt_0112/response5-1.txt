To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on your 401(k) if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are pre-tax and reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as contributions are after-tax but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you qualify, aiming to max out this account can provide great tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or if youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### Balancing Strategy:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. 
- **Bond Placement**: If you hold bonds, consider keeping them in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in financial goals.

### Overall:
- Align your contributions with your financial goals, considering the tax implications of each account type. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your situation.
