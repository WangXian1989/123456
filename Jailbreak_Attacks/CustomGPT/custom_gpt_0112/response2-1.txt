The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Offers tax-deductible contributions, ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments that might generate taxable income (like bonds) or for short-term goals.
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Focus:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Balance towards taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes, regardless of account type, to manage risk.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions as your financial situation and goals change.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation!
