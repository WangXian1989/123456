Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if your income allows it; it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Current Tax Bracket**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: If you're in a lower tax bracket, capital gains and qualified dividends can be taxed favorably (at 0% or 15%).

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-term Goals**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for compound growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for easier access.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of salary, focusing on employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds based on immediate needs or investment opportunities.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your allocations annually or in light of significant life changes (e.g., marriage, job change).

This strategy can optimize your tax efficiency and help you meet your financial goals effectively.
