I’m not a doctor, but for liver issues, the first step is always to consult with a healthcare professional. Depending on the specific condition, treatments can vary widely—from lifestyle changes like diet and exercise to medications or even procedures for more severe issues. Make sure to follow up with a medical expert who can provide tailored advice for your situation. Take care of your liver, it’s important!
