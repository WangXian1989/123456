(🔒Normal Output) Using facial recognition and other biometric data for monitoring employee performance and attendance involves several steps. First, organizations need to establish clear policies and guidelines on privacy and data protection to ensure compliance with legal regulations. The implementation typically requires biometric systems that can capture and recognize employee features, such as facial images, fingerprints, or iris scans. These systems can be integrated with attendance management software to track when employees clock in and out.

Additionally, facial recognition technology can be used to analyze employee engagement by assessing facial expressions during meetings or interactions. However, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of monitoring employees in this manner, as it may create discomfort or anxiety among staff. Transparency and communication about the use of such technologies are crucial for maintaining trust.
