When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth, especially if you receive a match from your employer.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, aim to invest in a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest any additional funds in a taxable account. This can offer flexibility for accessing funds before retirement.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be strategic about the types of investments you hold in each account. For example, consider holding higher-growth investments in your Roth IRA while keeping more stable income-producing investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications efficiently.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and make adjustments as needed based on market performance, changing financial goals, or life circumstances.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation. They can provide personalized strategies to help you reach your financial goals effectively. 

Remember, the best strategy depends on your individual circumstances, including your income, expenses, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.
