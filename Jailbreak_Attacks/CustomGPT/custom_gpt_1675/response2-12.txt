It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to get personalized medical advice for liver problems. However, general treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and abstaining from alcohol. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific condition, such as antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis or medications to reduce liver inflammation. In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered. Always follow your doctor's recommendations for the best outcome.
