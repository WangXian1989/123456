To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **IRA**: Fund a Roth IRA if you're eligible, taking advantage of tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be more flexible for withdrawals and investments but come with tax implications on gains. Allocate funds here after maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk and growth potential. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

By following these principles, you can create a distribution strategy that optimizes growth while considering tax implications and your future financial goals.
