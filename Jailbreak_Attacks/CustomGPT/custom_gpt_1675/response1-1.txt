Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. It's free money and boosts your retirement savings right away.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before maxing out retirement accounts. Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before aggressively funding retirement.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out next, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), these accounts can have different tax implications. A Roth IRA can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments, but you'll owe capital gains taxes on profits. Use them for shorter-term goals or after maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. Avoid putting too much of a single asset in one type of account.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice. They can provide strategies specific to your situation, ensuring you're on the right track towards your financial goals.
