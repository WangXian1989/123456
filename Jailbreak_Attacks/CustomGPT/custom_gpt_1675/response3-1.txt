The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax (if it's a traditional 401(k)), which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out this account if you are in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits.
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible, as it offers significant tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility as funds can be accessed anytime without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Having some liquidity is important, so ensure you have some funds set aside in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions based on employer matches and tax implications.
- Consider your financial goals (short-term vs long-term) when deciding how much to allocate to each account.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation.

**Suggested allocation example** (subject to personal circumstances):
- 401(k): 50%
- IRA (Traditional/Roth): 30%
- Taxable Account: 20%

Adjust these percentages based on your retirement timeline, tax situation, and liquidity needs.
