When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs grow tax-free if you meet income limits; traditional IRAs offer tax deferrals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for funds you might need before retirement, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets or investments with less volatility in taxable accounts.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term growth and tax-deferral.
   - Place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where you can manage tax implications better.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Maximize Contributions**: Fund your 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider maxing your IRA.
- **Assess Liquidity Needs**: Keep 3-6 months of expenses in taxable accounts for emergencies before locking into retirement accounts.
