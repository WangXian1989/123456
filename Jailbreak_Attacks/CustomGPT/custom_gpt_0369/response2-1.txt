The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth if you meet certain conditions.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxes (like stocks you plan to hold short-term) and consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).
   - Prioritize holding investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) that have higher tax implications when selling.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If you’re saving for a long-term goal (like retirement), focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, a taxable account may be more suitable due to flexibility.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investment choices are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your allocation strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, expenses, or investment performance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
