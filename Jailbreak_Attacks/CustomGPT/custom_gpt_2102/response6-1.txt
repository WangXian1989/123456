Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general guide to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):**
     - Employer-sponsored retirement plan.
     - Often includes employer matching contributions.
     - Contributions reduce your taxable income in the current year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
     - Growth is tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth IRAs).
     - Contribution limits are lower than 401(k).
     - More flexible investment options than 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Funds are accessible without penalties.
     - Capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they're realized.
     - No contribution limits.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals and Timeline**
   - Assess when you will need the money:
     - Short-term needs (1-5 years): Prioritize taxable accounts for easier access.
     - Long-term needs (5+ years): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).

### 3. **Optimize for Taxes**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
     - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (especially Roth, if eligible).
   - **Hold Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts:**
     - Place investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.
     - Avoid holding bonds or high-turnover funds in taxable accounts due to higher tax rates.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Ensure that your investment mix aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.
   - Consider different asset allocations based on account type:
     - More aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts since growth isnâ€™t taxed until withdrawal.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your evolving goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
1. **Start with Employer Contributions:** Max out your 401(k) to secure matching.
2. **Focus on IRAs:** Consider maxing out your IRA for tax advantages.
3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Maintain some liquidity for short-term needs.
