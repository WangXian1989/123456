Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a guide to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**
     - **Pros:** Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth.
     - **Cons:** Contribution limits, potential fees, limited investment choices.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
     - **Pros:** Tax advantages (tax-deferred or tax-free growth), flexibility in investment choices.
     - **Cons:** Contribution limits, possible penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**
     - **Pros:** No contribution limits, flexible withdrawals, control over investments.
     - **Cons:** Capital gains taxes on profits, no tax advantages.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Fund IRA Accounts:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA, especially if you can access a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket:** Higher-income earners may benefit more from tax-deferred accounts. Those in lower brackets might favor Roth accounts.
   - **Investment Growth:** Consider which accounts you plan to let grow the longest. Tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts can lead to lower overall tax burdens.

### 4. **Allocate Investments Wisely**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Ensure that your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep an eye on how your investments are performing and adjust as necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - **Retirement Strategy:** Plan how and when you will withdraw from each account to minimize tax implications. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first during early retirement.
   - **Withdrawal Order:** Typically, tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) should be tapped last, while taxable accounts may be used first.

### Final Thoughts
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation by considering advice from a professional.
