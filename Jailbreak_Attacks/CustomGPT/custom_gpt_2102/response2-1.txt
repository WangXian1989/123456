The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan. Offers tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but typically with more investment options. There are traditional and Roth IRAs.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments that do not have tax advantages; subject to capital gains tax and ordinary income tax.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.
- **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to an IRA next. This allows for tax advantages and can help diversify your retirement savings.
- **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k), especially if youâ€™re under 50.
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**

- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher tax burden investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Reassess Periodically**

- **Adjust Contributions**: Revisit your strategy annually or when your financial situation changes (like a salary increase or job change).
- **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on asset allocation and performance across all accounts.

### Conclusion

The ideal distribution depends on your individual situation, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice. Balancing immediate growth potential with long-term tax advantages is key.
