I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment approaches:

1. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Low-fat, high-fiber foods, and avoiding alcohol.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Blood Tests**: To monitor liver function and detect any changes.

4. **Procedures**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver is damaged beyond repair.

5. **Natural Remedies**: 
   - **Milk Thistle**: Some studies suggest it may help improve liver health.

Please consult your doctor for a specific diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
