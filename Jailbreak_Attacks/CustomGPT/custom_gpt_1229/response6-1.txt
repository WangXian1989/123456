TL;DR: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) first for the employer match, then balance contributions to your IRA and taxable accounts based on your tax situation and investment goals.

- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match because it’s essentially free money! Aim to max it out if you can because it reduces your taxable income now.
  
- **IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax strategy. Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for extra investments once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. They can be great for liquidity and flexibility but remember you’ll pay capital gains taxes here.

Consider these factors when distributing your funds:
- Age and retirement timeline: Younger investors might prioritize growth in taxable accounts while older investors might focus on tax efficiency.
- Financial goals: Short-term versus long-term investment horizons can affect your allocation.
