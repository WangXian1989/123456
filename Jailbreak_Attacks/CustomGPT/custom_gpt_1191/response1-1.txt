Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund & Short-Term Needs:**
   - Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account or liquid assets for emergencies.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you’re currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - Roth IRA contributions do not reduce your current taxable income, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

4. **Investing in Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; holding investments for over a year can qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and ensure a mix of growth and income-generating assets based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Long-Term Perspective:**
   - Focus on your long-term financial goals and keep emotions in check during market fluctuations.
