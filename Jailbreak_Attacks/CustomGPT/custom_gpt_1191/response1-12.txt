1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, refined sugars, and sodium.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Hydration**: Drinking sufficient water.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may include antiviral drugs, steroids, or other specific treatments.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**:
   - Frequent follow-up appointments to monitor liver function and detect any worsening conditions.

4. **Avoidance of Alcohol and Toxins**:
   - Abstaining from alcohol and avoiding exposure to harmful substances is crucial.

5. **Potential Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsies or even liver transplants may be necessary.

6. **Supplements**:
   - Certain supplements, like milk thistle, are thought to support liver health, but speak with a healthcare provider before starting any.
