To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if your tax bracket allows, as the contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth and withdrawals. For traditional IRAs, remember contributions may be tax-deductible.

### 2. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **401(k):** Invest in a mix of stock and bond funds, tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA:** Similar to your 401(k), but might allow for different investment options like individual stocks or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (like municipal bonds) and hold on to investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawals and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) & IRAs:** Withdrawals before age 59Â½ typically incur penalties. Plan for retirement spending accordingly.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can offer more flexibility as you can access your funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your investments in each account to maintain your desired asset allocation over time.

### Final Thoughts
Balancing contributions to each account based on your income, tax situation, and investment goals is critical. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide tailored insights.
