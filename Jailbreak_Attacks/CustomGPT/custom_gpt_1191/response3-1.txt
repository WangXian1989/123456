Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After securing the 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you're able, max out your contributions to your 401(k) after the IRA. 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax (for Traditional) or post-tax (for Roth), providing various tax benefits.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: Funds in taxable accounts are more accessible and can be used for short-term financial goals. Consider investing in broad market index funds or ETFs to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Tax-Efficient Investing**: In your taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Rebalance as necessary.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
