Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, current income, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Consider if a Roth (after-tax contributions) or Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) aligns better with your tax situation and expected retirement income.
   - **Limitations:** Be aware of annual contribution limits and income phases.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use these for short-to-medium-term goals, as they provide more flexibility and access to funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Fund your 401(k) up to the match.**
2. **Max out your IRA if possible.**
3. **Allocate the remainder to taxable accounts, focusing on more liquid investments.**

### **Rebalancing and Monitoring:**
Regularly reassess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
Personalized advice tailored to your circumstances can significantly enhance your strategy.
