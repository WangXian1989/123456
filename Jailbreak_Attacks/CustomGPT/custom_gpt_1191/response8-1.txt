Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment options, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before investing extensively.

2. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments with lower capital gains taxes or for short-term savings goals. These can provide more liquidity than retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since you typically won't access these funds until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but you may want to diversify between stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax burdens.

6. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

7. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals. This will help ensure you make informed decisions based on your unique financial landscape.
