Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** If possible, max out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after prioritizing the 401(k) match.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs are tax-free upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) here.

### 3. **Investment Strategies:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, ETFs) since these accounts have tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 5. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.

This strategy can help optimize your tax situation while aligning with your financial objectives.
