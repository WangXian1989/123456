To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Use traditional contributions for pre-tax advantages if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify based on income limits. If you're in a high tax bracket, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Liquidity:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds, as they provide easy access to your cash without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Management:** Invest in tax-efficient strategies, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes when selling.

### 3. **Balance Asset Allocation by Account Type**
   - **Higher Growth Investments:** Hold stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth for as long as possible.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Consider placing bonds in taxable accounts since they typically generate less favorable tax treatment compared to equities.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, contributions, and changes in financial goals.
   - **Contribution Strategy:** Adjust contributions annually based on changes in income, tax laws, or retirement plans.

### Summary
- Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
- Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility and immediate needs.
- Tailor your asset allocation to leverage tax efficiencies based on the type of account.
