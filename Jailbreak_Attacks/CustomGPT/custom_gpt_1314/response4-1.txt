To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can afford more, aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, also contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax implications differ, so weigh contributions based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments, as you can defer taxes on growth.
   - Consider bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities since interest income is taxed in the year it's earned.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an accessible emergency fund in a high-yield savings account separate from your investment accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to reduce capital gains tax.
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market changes.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your retirement savings strategy and minimize tax liabilities.
