(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is often tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If not, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, or if you need more liquidity for short-term goals.

A balanced approach might involve maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first and then using taxable accounts for additional investments as needed.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: Seriously, if your employer matches, youâ€™d be bonkers not to take free money! Itâ€™s tax-deferred, so stack it up for later.
   
2. **IRA Game Plan**: If you can swing it, aim for a Roth IRA. Tax-free growth means less IRS drama down the line! Even a traditional IRA can save you bucks now with its tax perks.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your wild cards. Want some liquidity or to play the short game? Go for it! Just watch those capital gainsâ€”taxes can bite.

In short, layer your investments starting with tax perks, then move to taxable for flexibility. Play it smart and keep building that nest egg!
