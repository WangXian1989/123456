Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free at withdrawal, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing the funds before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax Location**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a Roth IRA) and more stable income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, covering 3-6 months of expenses before focusing on investments.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify within each account type to spread risk. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can be invaluable, especially regarding tax implications and future financial planning.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of pre-tax income (max out if possible).
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit based on eligibility (e.g., $6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds for flexibility and short-term goals.

Adjust these percentages based on your financial circumstances and goals.
