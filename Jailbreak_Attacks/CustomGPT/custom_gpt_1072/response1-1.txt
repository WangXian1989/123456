Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help you maximize your savings and tax efficiency. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term or for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification**: Keep a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Strategic Withdrawals**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
