To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers higher contribution limits. Depending on your plan, contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Look to max out IRA contributions if possible, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds:
   - Consider holding investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; long-term holdings typically reduce tax liability.

4. **Debt Considerations**: Pay down high-interest debt before investing, as this can save you more in interest than the returns you might earn on investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts might have different investment strategies based on time horizon and risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance, changes in financial goals, and market conditions.

Overall, itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
