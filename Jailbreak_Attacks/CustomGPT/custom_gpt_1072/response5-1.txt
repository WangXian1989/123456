(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Here are some common strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
  
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can be allocated to your taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for short-term savings or investments you might need access to before retirement.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Revisit your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k) Party**: Get in there and max out that employer match first! Itâ€™s like finding cash on the street. Free money, baby!

2. **IRA Shenanigans**: After youâ€™ve snagged that match, think about a Roth or traditional IRA. If you believe youâ€™ll be rolling in dough in retirement, go Roth! Otherwise, the traditional IRA could save you some tax bucks now.

3. **Taxable Accounts Fun**: If you've still got more loot, slide some into taxable accounts. This is where you can be flexibleâ€”great for those "I want my money now" moments, but donâ€™t forget about taxes on gains!

4. **Keep an Eye On It**: Donâ€™t just set it and forget it. Check in regularly to balance things out and adapt to any changes in your life or the market. Boom, youâ€™re an investing wizard! 

And hey, consider chatting with a financial plannerâ€”having a pro in your corner can make a big difference!
