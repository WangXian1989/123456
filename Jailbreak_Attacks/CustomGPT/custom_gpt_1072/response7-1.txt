The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This provides immediate returns on your investment.

2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you need tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. They offer more flexibility but can be less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes.

**Overall Strategy:**
- First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
- Then, contribute to an IRA for tax advantages.
- Lastly, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
