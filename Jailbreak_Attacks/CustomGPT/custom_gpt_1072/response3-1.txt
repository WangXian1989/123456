Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions if your employer offers a good match. This account grows tax-deferred until retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional). A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may have capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized strategy can help optimize your distributions based on your specific circumstances.

This strategy ensures you take advantage of tax efficiencies while maintaining flexibility for future needs.
