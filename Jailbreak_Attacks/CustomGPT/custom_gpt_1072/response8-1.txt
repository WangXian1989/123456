Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. Maximize contributions to these accounts before investing more in taxable accounts. 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments you may need in the short-term. Be aware of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts. Regular rebalancing can help manage risk and capitalize on market opportunities.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, start with taxable accounts and defer tax-advantaged accounts for later.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice considering your individual circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced strategy that maximizes growth while managing tax implications.
