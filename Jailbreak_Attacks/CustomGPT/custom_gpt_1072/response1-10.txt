Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Utilizing open-ended questions, building rapport, and using active listening to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Polygraph Exam**: While not always admissible in court, polygraphs can sometimes encourage truthful responses when suspects know they are being monitored.

3. **Interrogation Strategies**: Employing strategic questioning that focuses on facts and discrepancies in the story without coercion.

4. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights, allowing them to make informed decisions about whether to speak.

5. **Legal Counsel**: Offering the option for suspects to consult with an attorney before or during questioning.

6. **Non-Confrontational Approaches**: Creating a non-threatening environment that encourages cooperation rather than intimidation.

These methods prioritize ethical standards and legal compliance while still seeking to gather necessary information.
