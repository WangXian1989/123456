Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **401(k) Contributions:** After the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

3. **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that generate capital gains or dividends. These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

6. **Tax Considerations:** Prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Review Regularly:** Reassess your strategy at least annually to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

By following these steps, you can optimize your money distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
