Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some best practices:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth). Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k):** After meeting your employer match, contribute up to the annual limit if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This provides more withdrawal flexibility and may offer tax efficiencies on long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (IRA or Roth 401(k)).
   - If you expect to be in a lower bracket, Traditional accounts may be better.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a good mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and growth.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess**
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions periodically, especially after significant life changes or market fluctuations.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically for your situation. 

Strategically balancing contributions based on your unique circumstances will help enhance growth and provide for your retirement effectively.
