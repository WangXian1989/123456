I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for the best advice tailored to your specific liver issue. They may consider options such as:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet improvements, including reducing saturated fats, sugars, and alcohol.
   - Regular exercise to aid liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Prescribed treatments depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures might be necessary, such as liver transplants.

Please make sure to consult your healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
