To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversify Accounts**: Allocate investments that may appreciate significantly (e.g., stocks) in Roth accounts, while placing more stable, income-generating investments (e.g., bonds) in the traditional accounts to optimize taxation upon withdrawal.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that offer liquidity and flexibility without the restrictions of retirement accounts. Prioritize investments with favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances and retirement goals.

Strategically diversifying among these accounts can help maximize tax efficiency and support your long-term financial plans.
