Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions to the annual limit, especially if you have high-income years.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you've maxed out retirement accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but you'll be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk. Consider asset allocation that balances stocks, bonds, and other investments.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. Tax-efficient funds can help minimize tax burdens in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
