Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - If you opt for a Traditional IRA, understand the tax implications upon withdrawal.

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:**
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k), especially if it has a wide range of investment options with low fees.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Consider this for money you may need in the short to medium term, where you want flexibility but may face capital gains tax. Use it for investments that yield lower tax burdens, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes and sectors to mitigate risks.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### 7. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type, particularly in retirement. 

### Summary:
Start by maximizing your contributions where you get the best tax advantages, prioritize employer matching, diversify your investments, and adjust based on your financial situation and goals. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
