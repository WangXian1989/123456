To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   
2. **Balance Investment Goals and Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate significant short-term capital gains or interest income, as tax treatment can be less favorable compared to tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains, while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Monitor the performance of your investments and rebalance your accounts as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering factors like market changes and personal risk tolerance.

By paying attention to these strategies, you can enhance your investment growth while managing tax efficiency.
