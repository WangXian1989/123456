The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts First**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: For high-income earners, this can be beneficial due to higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement or for goals outside of retirement.

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Bonds are typically better held in tax-advantaged accounts because they're taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Balance your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Ensure that your allocations across all accounts are diversified.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your distributions and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
