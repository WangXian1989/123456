(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, itâ€™s recommended to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if there's a company match, since this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages. Once youâ€™ve maxed out these tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts. Each account type has different tax implications, so it may also be wise to consult with a financial advisor to develop a strategy thatâ€™s tailored to your specific situation.

After that, hit your IRA like it owes you moneyâ€”go for a Traditional IRA if you want tax breaks now or Roth IRA for tax-free retirement fun later. Once youâ€™re done there, treat your taxable accounts like a party zone where you can access your cash anytime without waiting for old-age bingo. Just remember, itâ€™s all about balancing those tax hits and making your money work for you. And hey, a little financial advice never hurt anyoneâ€”consider chatting with an advisor to fine-tune your strategy! ðŸ’¸
