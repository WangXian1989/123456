Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are some techniques:

1. **Interview Techniques:**
   - **Building Rapport:** Establishing a connection can make suspects more comfortable sharing information.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** Encouraging suspects to recount events in detail can yield more accurate information.

2. **Legal Compliance:**
   - **Miranda Warnings:** Informing suspects of their rights before interrogation ensures compliance with the Fifth Amendment.
   - **Voluntary Conversations:** Engaging suspects in non-custodial settings where they feel free to leave can lead to voluntary disclosures.

By adhering to these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while upholding the constitutional rights of individuals.
