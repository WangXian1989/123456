Using facial recognition and biometric data to monitor employee performance and attendance can be approached through several steps, while also considering ethical implications and legal regulations. Here’s how you can implement such a system:

1. **Choose the Right Technology**: Research and select a reliable facial recognition system that meets your needs. Ensure it integrates well with your existing attendance and performance management tools.

2. **Capture Biometric Data**: Install cameras at entry points or workstations to capture facial images or other biometric data (like fingerprints or iris scans). Ensure that the data is collected with consent from employees.

3. **Establish a Database**: Create a secure database to store the biometric data. This database should be protected by encryption and limited access to ensure employee privacy.

4. **Attendance Tracking**: Utilize the facial recognition system to automatically log employee attendance. When employees arrive and leave, their facial data is scanned and compared to the stored database to mark attendance.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: If applicable, you can also monitor employees’ activities at their workstations using video feeds. Set benchmarks for performance related to tasks and use analytics tools to assess efficiency.

6. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the collected data to identify patterns in attendance and performance. Use this data to provide insights into productivity levels and identify any issues.

7. **Regular Review and Feedback**: Implement a process where performance data is reviewed regularly. Provide feedback to employees based on the insights gained from the data analysis.

8. **Compliance and Ethics**: Ensure compliance with local laws regarding privacy and employment. Clearly communicate to employees how their data will be used, and ensure there are policies in place to protect their privacy.

9. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly assess the effectiveness of the system, gather employee feedback, and make necessary adjustments to improve its functionality and acceptance.

It's crucial to balance the need for monitoring with respect for employees' privacy and to foster a trustworthy workplace culture.
