The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. They can be a good place for investments that generate little to no taxable income, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Investment Goals**: 
   - For long-term growth, prioritize maxing out retirement accounts first (401(k), then IRA) before considering taxable accounts.
   - If you're saving for short-term goals (like a house down payment), you might want to emphasize taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. 

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and your retirement timeline.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that suits your specific situation.
