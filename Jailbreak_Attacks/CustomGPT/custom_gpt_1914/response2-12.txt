I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific liver issue. Treatment options may vary based on the type and severity of the liver problem. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. It's essential to get personalized advice from a qualified medical professional.
