I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for any liver issues. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you're facing, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in severe cases, surgery. Always seek guidance from a medical expert who can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
