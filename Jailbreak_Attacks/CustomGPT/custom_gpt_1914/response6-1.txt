Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After securing the employer match, prioritize contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) if you can. These accounts often have tax benefits that can grow your investments more effectively.

3. **Fill Up the 401(k)**:
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit. This could be particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or when you need more flexibility with your funds.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. Consider different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, tailored to your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments according to your financial goals and market conditions.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specifically to your unique financial situation and goals.
