The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide tax benefits that help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Consider Roth IRAs**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon. This can help mitigate risk while aiming for growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, offering flexibility for short-term goals. However, be aware of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations, especially as your financial situation changes, to make necessary adjustments.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
