Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:** Funds in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and IRA grow tax-free until withdrawal. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, which is important to consider for your future tax bracket. Taxable accounts will have different implications, such as capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Diversification of Investments:** Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. While tax-advantaged accounts often focus on long-term growth investments, taxable accounts could include a mix of growth and income-generating investments that may offer tax-efficient dividends.

4. **Asset Location Strategy:** Place higher-growing assets (which may incur higher taxes upon sale) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding assets that produce taxable income (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals and market conditions. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
