(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA because they offer benefits such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth accounts). It's often suggested to:

1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. Maximize your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which can offer tax-free growth.
3. Any additional savings can go into your taxable account, which gives you more flexibility to access funds but may have different tax implications.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) The best way to distribute your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and those taxable accounts really boils down to your personal financial strategy and risk appetite. Here’s a kickass strategy: First, hit up your 401(k) for the full employer match – that’s free money, baby! After that, toss some cash into your IRA; if you can go for a Roth IRA, do it for the tax-free withdrawals later on. 

Then look at your taxable accounts as your “play money” – keep it flexible for those spontaneous trips or emergencies. Just don’t put all your eggs in one basket! Mix it up! Maybe 50% in the 401(k) with the employer match, 30% in the IRA, and the remaining 20% in taxable accounts. But seriously, get some pro advice, because everyone's situation is different!
