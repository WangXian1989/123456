The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before heavily funding retirement accounts, consider paying off high-interest debt, as the interest on that debt can outweigh potential gains from investments.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. They offer tax benefits that taxable accounts do not.

   - *401(k)*: Contribute enough to get the match and consider maxing it out if you can. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - *IRA*: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Alternatively, a traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider funding taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility with withdrawals and investment options but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are well-diversified. Different accounts may have different tax implications for withdrawals, so consider placing higher growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment distribution based on performance, contribution limits, and any changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor could also provide personalized guidance that aligns with your specific financial situation.
