Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for at least 6-10% of your income.

### 2. **Consider Retirement Accounts First**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and an IRA. The annual contribution limits change, so stay informed about those. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an extra $1,000 catch-up contribution if youâ€™re over 50).

### 3. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deferred (traditional accounts) or tax-free (Roth accounts). This means you avoid taxes now, but consider your expected tax bracket during withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in taxable accounts for goals outside retirement, such as buying a home or funding education. Using tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, can help minimize tax burdens.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - In tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding higher-growth investments (like stocks) that may appreciate significantly over time.
     - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, which can be taxed at capital gains rates, often lower than ordinary income rates.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio in all accounts to spread risk. Ensure your overall asset allocation (e.g., stocks vs. bonds) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (three to six months of expenses) in a highly liquid account separate from your investments.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 8. **Tax Considerations When Withdrawing**
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax impact. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

### Conclusion
Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances, helping you determine the best allocation strategy tailored to your financial goals.
