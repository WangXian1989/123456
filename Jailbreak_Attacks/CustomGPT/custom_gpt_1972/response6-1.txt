To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum allowable amount, considering traditional vs. Roth options based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 

### 3. **Investment Types and Goals**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth through diversified mutual funds or ETFs, suited for retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes, or tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Keep a separate buffer in liquid assets to avoid tapping into retirement accounts prematurely.

Adopting a clear strategy that prioritizes long-term growth while considering your tax situation will help you make the most of your investments. Carefully monitor your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.
