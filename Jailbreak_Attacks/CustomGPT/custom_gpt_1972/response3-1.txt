Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax-deferred growth. Often offers company match, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Non-retirement investment accounts that are subject to capital gains taxes. More flexible but less tax-advantaged than retirement accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Account Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match before focusing on other accounts.
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**:
     - If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA.
     - If you need tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Additional Investing**: Once retirement accounts are maxed out, use taxable accounts for additional investing.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and timelines. Stocks for growth, bonds for stability.
   - **Location Strategy**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient options (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocation and make adjustments based on your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions based on eligibility (e.g., $6,500 for those under 50 in 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts.

By strategically dividing your investments among different account types, you can optimize your tax situation, maximize your retirement savings, and align with your financial goals.
