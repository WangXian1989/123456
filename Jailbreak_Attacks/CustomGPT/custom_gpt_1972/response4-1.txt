Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxable.
- **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits ($22,500 for individuals under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older in 2023).

### 2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**
- **Traditional IRA:** This option allows for tax-deductible contributions, but taxes are due on withdrawals during retirement.
- **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax income, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits:** The limits are $6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility:** These accounts offer the most flexibility and can be accessed without penalty at any time. They’re great for short-term goals and emergency savings.
- **Capital Gains Tax:** Be aware of capital gains taxes on earnings. Long-term investments (held over one year) typically incur lower tax rates than short-term investments.
- **Investment Diversity:** Consider holding investments here that might generate less favorable tax treatment (e.g., bonds) or that require more flexibility.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) enough to get any employer match.
- **Assess Immediate vs. Long-Term Needs:** For short-term needs, focus on the taxable account; for retirement, balance contributions between your 401(k) and IRA accounts.
- **Tax Considerations:** If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. In higher brackets, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more suitable.
- **Automate Contributions:** Set up automatic contributions to ensure consistent savings and benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

### **Review and Adjust**
Regularly review your investment allocation based on performance, tax implications, and changes in your financial situation. Adjust your strategy as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice suited to your unique circumstances.
