The ideal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit—it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, you might consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer a tax deduction now, consider a traditional IRA.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After maximizing contributions to the IRA, return to your 401(k) to maximize your contributions. The 401(k) typically has higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maximizing retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals and can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts. Consider asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) can optimize tax efficiency.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
