I'm not a doctor, but if you're facing liver issues, the best course of action typically includes the following steps:

1. **Consult a healthcare professional:** Get a proper diagnosis from a doctor, as liver problems can vary widely in nature and severity.

2. **Lifestyle changes:** 
   - **Diet:** Adopt a liver-friendly diet, which often includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding processed foods, excessive salt, and sugar.
   - **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water to help your liver function.

3. **Medication:** Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

4. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups can help monitor liver function and adjust treatments as necessary.

5. **Avoid alcohol and drugs:** These can further damage the liver, so it's crucial to abstain or follow your doctor's advice on use.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
