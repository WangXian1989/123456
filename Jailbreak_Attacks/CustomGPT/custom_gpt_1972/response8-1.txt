Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, although they may incur capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep in mind the different types of investments in each account. For example, placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) can be beneficial, while using taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds) may result in less tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your investment performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs will be taxed as income, while contributions to Roth IRAs and qualified distributions are tax-free.

7. **Holistic Planning**: If you have other financial goals such as buying a home or funding education, consider how these fit into your overall financial plan and adjust your distributions accordingly.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your personal circumstances.
