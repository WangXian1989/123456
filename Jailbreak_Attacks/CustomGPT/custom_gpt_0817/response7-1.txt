The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your IRA contributions, go back to contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you can afford to do so. This can further increase your retirement savings and tax advantages.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Invest in taxable accounts for goals that lie outside retirement. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments, although you'll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are properly diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:** Keep in mind the different tax implications of each account type. For example, long-term capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so consider this when deciding where to place your investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Lastly, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy that aligns with your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations.

### Final Points
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- Regularly review and adjust contributions as your financial situation evolves.
- Stay informed about changing tax laws that may impact your investment strategy.

It's essential to create a balanced approach that aligns with your overall financial objectives.
