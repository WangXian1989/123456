Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you determine the best approach:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Max out your contributions if you can, especially if you're in a higher income bracket, as contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: 
   - Contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. With a Roth IRA, you pay taxes now, and your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later.
   - If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after contributing to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments beyond your retirement accounts. They offer more flexibility and quicker access to your funds without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).
   - These accounts can also serve as a source for short-term savings goals or investments that might incur capital gains taxes, so choose your investments wisely (consider tax-efficient funds).

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across the various accounts, taking into account asset allocation and risk.
   - Consider your tax situation when choosing investments; for instance, it may be beneficial to hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: 
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations based on your changing life circumstances, market conditions, and financial goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific situation and goals.
