When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, so prioritize maximizing contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Treatment**: Consider your expected tax situation. A Traditional IRA offers immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize your contributions to an IRA after you've secured your 401(k) match, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts is accessible without penalties, making them ideal for savings goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize funding the 401(k) to receive the match.
- Max out IRA contributions next, focusing on the account type that best suits your tax situation.
- Contribute to a taxable account for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
