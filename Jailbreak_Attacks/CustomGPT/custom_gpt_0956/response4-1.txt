When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (traditional or Roth) as both options offer tax advantages. A traditional IRA may allow for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Evaluate your current tax bracket. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket, contributing to a Roth IRA could be more beneficial since you'll pay taxes on contributions now, but withdrawals will be tax-free in retirement.

4. **Diversification Across Account Types**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to provide flexibility in retirement for tax planning. 

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties (unlike retirement accounts), making them useful for unexpected expenses or early retirement needs. They also benefit from capital gains tax rates on long-term investments.

6. **Adjust Based on Age & Goals**: Younger investors might lean towards aggressive growth in their 401(k) and IRAs, while those nearing retirement might shift towards more conservative investments.

7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Your financial situation and tax laws will change. Make it a habit to review your asset allocation, contributions, and overall investment strategy at least annually.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
