When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After ensuring you’re getting the full employer match, consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) if you can. This account allows for tax-deferred growth, and contributions lower your taxable income now.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your circumstances). A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA can also reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions and still have additional funds to invest, consider putting money into a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties and provides different tax benefits on investments, such as capital gains rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, consider holding more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, and use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or bonds that generate less taxable income.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment strategy as market conditions change or as you get closer to retirement.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best way to distribute your money depends on your financial situation, tax considerations, and retirement strategy. It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
