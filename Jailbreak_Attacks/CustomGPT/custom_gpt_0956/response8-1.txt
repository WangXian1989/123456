To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the match, focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk and improve potential returns.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like high-dividend stocks) and for shorter-term financial goals. Consider holding investments with long-term capital gains potential here to minimize taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, your account values will change. Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your overall financial situation.

Remember, the best strategy depends on your individual circumstances, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.
