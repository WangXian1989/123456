When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should weigh several factors, including your current income, anticipated expenses, tax implications, and retirement goals. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts offer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Allocate funds towards taxable accounts to maintain liquidity for short-term goals or emergencies. 
   - This allows you to invest in a diversified portfolio without penalties for early withdrawal, unlike retirement accounts.

3. **Balance Investment Choices:**
   - Invest higher-risk assets in your tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral on gains.
   - Place more conservative investments in taxable accounts where you may be subject to capital gains taxes upon selling.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket now, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) may provide immediate tax benefits.
   - Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, Roth IRAs (where contributions are tax-paid) might be a wise choice.

5. **Regularly Review Allocations:**
   - Make a practice of reviewing your allocations annually or after major life events. This ensures your investments align with your financial goals.

In summary, striking a balance between tax-advantaged accounts and taxable accounts, while considering personal financial goals and tax implications, will help you effectively distribute your money.
