When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be considered, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to optimize your distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Retirement Accounts**: 
   - Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - Next, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two depends on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and IRA are pre-tax, meaning you defer taxes until withdrawal, typically in retirement. 
   - Roth accounts are funded with after-tax money, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts are funded with after-tax money, and you'll pay taxes on any dividends and capital gains.

3. **Determine Your Time Horizon**:
   - For short-term goals (less than 5 years), use taxable accounts for liquidity. 
   - For mid to long-term savings (5+ years), lean more on your 401(k) and IRAs, as they often provide better growth potential over time.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - Keep lower-growth or yielding investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts, as they may have more favorable tax treatment.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio at least annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual circumstances vary greatly, and a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your income, tax situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a strategic approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
