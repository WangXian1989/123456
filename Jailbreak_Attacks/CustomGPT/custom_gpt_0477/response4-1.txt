Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Contributions:** Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Roth 401(k) contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Investment Options:** Review the investment options available in your 401(k) to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Types:** Decide between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions on contributions, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs, currently set at $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50) for the 2023 tax year.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans, which can be beneficial for portfolio diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Investment Strategy:** Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling investments. Therefore, consider holding investments for the long term to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide more flexibility since there are no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, making them useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable distributions.

4. **Balanced Portfolio:**
   - **Diversification:** Aim to create a balanced portfolio across these accounts to maximize growth while managing risk. Consider your asset allocation strategy (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.
   - **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Overall, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation and goals.
