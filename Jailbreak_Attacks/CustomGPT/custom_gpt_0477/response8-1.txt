The optimal distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the employer match. The contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, direct any additional savings to taxable accounts. Understand that capital gains and dividends will be taxed, but this account offers more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Asset Placement**:
   - Place high-growth investments (stocks, equity funds) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Interest-generating investments (bonds, bond funds) may be better suited for taxable accounts due to the higher tax rate on ordinary income.

5. **Regularly Review Your Strategy**: As your financial situation changes (e.g., salary increases, changes in expenses), reassess your contributions to each account type to ensure your distribution aligns with your investment goals and tax strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure or have complex financial situations, a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations.

This approach enables efficient tax management and growth of your retirement savings.
