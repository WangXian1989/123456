The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions to an IRA if you qualify for tax deductions or if you are focusing on long-term growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Money in 401(k)s and IRAs grows tax-deferred (and tax-free in the case of Roth accounts), which is beneficial for long-term savings.
   - Taxable accounts will incur taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so consider placing more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across asset classes within each account. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep track of your asset allocation across all accounts. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired allocation based on performance and contributions.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider your future withdrawal strategy. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - It may be beneficial to consult a financial planner to create a personalized strategy based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual circumstances and goals.
