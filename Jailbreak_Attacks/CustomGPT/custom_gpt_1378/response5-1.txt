Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your age, income, tax situation, and investment goals. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to earn any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Next, consider maxing out an IRA, either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. This can offer tax advantages and more investment options.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed limit, especially if you have not yet reached it.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maximized your contributions to retirement accounts, then consider investing in taxable brokerage accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on your financial goals and market conditions.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
