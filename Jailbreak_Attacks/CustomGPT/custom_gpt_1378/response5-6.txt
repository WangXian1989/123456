1. **Hit 'Em Online**: Get on platforms where they actually hang outâ€”TikTok, Instagram, Twitterâ€”work your magic with memes, short videos, and bold graphics thatâ€™ll make them stop scrolling.

2. **Keep It Real**: Young folks can sniff out fakes from a mile away. Be genuine, share real stories, and ditch the corporate jargon. Speak their language and be relatable!

3. **Talk About What Matters**: If it doesnâ€™t resonate with their worldâ€”like student debt, climate action, or mental healthâ€”forget it! Show them how your policies align with their dreams and fears.

4. **Influencer Vibes**: Team up with cool influencers who can make your message pop. Young voters trust their peers way more than some suit on a stage.

5. **Simplicity is Key**: Make everything about voting super easy to understandâ€”like clear graphics that show how to register and where to vote. If itâ€™s a hassle, theyâ€™ll bounce. Keep it simple, keep it friendly!
