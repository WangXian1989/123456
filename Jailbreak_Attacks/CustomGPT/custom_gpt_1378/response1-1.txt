Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer matching contributions if available. This is effectively "free money." Aim to contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax deductions now, consider a traditional IRA, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for short-term goals or for liquidity. Invest in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k)** to get the full employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (traditional or Roth, depending on your situation).
- **Any remaining funds** can go into taxable accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might lean more towards growth (higher risk), while those nearing retirement may prioritize income stability.
- **Tax Situations**: Take into account your current and expected future tax rates.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify within each account to mitigate risk.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial needs. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
