To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA after meeting your employer match. IRAs can offer tax advantages that may be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable accounts. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility for short-term expenses.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax considerations. For instance:
   - Keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments that may produce income.

5. **Withdrawal Timing**: Plan how and when you might access funds from these accounts, as withdrawal rules differ significantly, especially for retirement accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Each individual's situation is unique, so itâ€™s wise to consult a financial advisor for tailored guidance based on your specific goals and financial situation.

Balancing your contributions will depend on your current financial situation, goals, and the specifics of the tax implications.
