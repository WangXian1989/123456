I'm not a medical professional, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. They might recommend various treatment options depending on the specific liver condition, which could include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This could involve dietary modifications, such as reducing alcohol intake and eating a healthier diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to help manage the situation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progression of the condition and the effectiveness of treatments.

4. **Supplements**: Some patients might benefit from vitamins or supplements, but these should only be taken under medical supervision.

5. **Advanced Procedures**: In severe cases, options such as a liver transplant may be considered.

Always follow your doctor's advice and discuss any treatment options with them to find the best course of action for your specific situation.
