When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)s), reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you qualify, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA also provides tax advantages but taxes withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits ($6,500 for under 50, $7,500 if 50 or older as of 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep liquid savings for emergencies separate from investment funds.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Use these for investments with favorable long-term capital gains rates, like stocks, to minimize tax impact.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate fewer taxable distributions.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize contributions** to the 401(k) up to the employer match.
- **Then, fund the IRA**, maximizing contributions based on your income and tax situation.
- **Finally, allocate excess funds** to taxable accounts for additional investment flexibility.

### Rebalancing and Review:
- Regularly review your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and goals. Adjust contributions as your financial situation changes.

### Consider Taxes: 
- Always be aware of tax implications. Long-term gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.
