Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering various factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions depending on your income.

2. **Account Prioritization**: 
   - Prioritize high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a Roth IRA) because the growth is tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use your taxable account for investments that generate income (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks), as capital gains on these may be taxed at lower rates.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. This helps manage risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation at least annually and adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about how you will withdraw funds. The order of withdrawal can impact your taxes significantly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can offer personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

By strategically allocating your investments across these accounts, you can optimize both your growth potential and tax efficiency.
