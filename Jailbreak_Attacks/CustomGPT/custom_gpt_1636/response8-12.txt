I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

### **1. Lifestyle Modifications**
- **Diet Changes**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Reduce fat, sugar, and salt intake.
- **Regular Exercise**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week to help maintain a healthy weight.
- **Limit Alcohol**: Avoid or significantly reduce alcohol consumption, as it can worsen liver issues.

### **2. Medications**
