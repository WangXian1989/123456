Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if it fits your budget.
   - **IRA:** After maxing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, based on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide an immediate tax deduction.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, dividends, or interest income, which could affect your tax bracket. Diversify with tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs:**
   - Keep an adequate emergency fund in cash or a high-yield savings account, separate from your investment accounts.

4. **Balanced Portfolio:**
   - Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversify across asset classes in all accounts while being mindful of tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking taxes into consideration when selling investments.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
