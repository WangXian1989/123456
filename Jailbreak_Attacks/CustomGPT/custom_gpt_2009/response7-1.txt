Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires a strategic approach. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers low-cost investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment strategies that may require liquidity or for shorter-term goals. Incorporate low-turnover funds or investments to minimize tax implications.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For long-term growth, equities in tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial due to the compounding of tax-free growth.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice suited to your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution among these accounts effectively.
