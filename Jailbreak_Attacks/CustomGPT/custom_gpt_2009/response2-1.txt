Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high contribution limit with potential employer matching, prioritize this account.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax strategy (traditional IRA for tax deductions now; Roth for tax-free withdrawals later).

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for extra savings after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes with this type of account.

4. **Consider Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might prefer growth-oriented investments in their accounts, while those closer to retirement should consider more conservative options.
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance in all accounts, adjusting as you near retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes, regardless of account type.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual financial situations, a professional can provide tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to your retirement savings.
