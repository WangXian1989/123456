The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of that match first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) based on your current tax situation and expected tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. This may be beneficial if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age, as these accounts have fewer restrictions on withdrawals.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of tax implications. For example, placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts can enhance overall tax efficiency.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and account distributions, adjusting as necessary based on changes in financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
