Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds available after contributing to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. These can provide more flexibility in accessing funds before retirement age.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications for each account type. Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) will be taxed upon withdrawal, whereas taxable accounts enable capital gains tax and dividend tax considerations.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure proper diversification and asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your strategy to adjust for changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy.
