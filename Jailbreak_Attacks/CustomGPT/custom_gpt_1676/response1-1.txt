Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions. Choose based on your current vs. future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance annually to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance considering your overall financial situation.

Always consider your individual circumstances and goals when making these decisions!
