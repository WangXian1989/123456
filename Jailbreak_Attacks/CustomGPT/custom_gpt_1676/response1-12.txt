   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity aids in maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, various medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function are essential.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from certain vitamins or herbal supplements, but consult a doctor first.
