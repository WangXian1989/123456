To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, also with tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments subject to capital gains tax, typically more flexible for withdrawals.

### 2. **Contribution Priorities**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. This can offer tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth and tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for holding investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Monitor your allocations and performance regularly. Adjust contributions based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances and goals.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
