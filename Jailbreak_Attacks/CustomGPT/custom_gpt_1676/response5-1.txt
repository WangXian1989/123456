(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out the employer match, focus on funding your IRA, especially if it offers tax benefits, such as a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially if you anticipate needing the funds before retirement. 

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.

1. **401(k) First**: Hit that employer match like itâ€™s the jackpotâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! 
2. **IRA Love**: After you max out that sweet match, dive into your IRA. If youâ€™re aiming for tax-free gains, go Roth; if you want a tax deduction now, traditional IRA it is!
3. **Flex it in Taxable Accounts**: Finally, throw some funds into a taxable account for flexibility. No penalties for early withdraws here, but watch out for tax implications on gains. 

And seriously, donâ€™t forget to check in with a financial pro to keep your strategy sharp!
