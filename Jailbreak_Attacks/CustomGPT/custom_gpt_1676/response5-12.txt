I'm not a doctor, but there are several general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with your healthcare provider. These can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Supplements**: Some people find that certain supplements, like milk thistle, may provide liver support, but consult your doctor first.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant or surgery to address liver tumors may be indicated.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
