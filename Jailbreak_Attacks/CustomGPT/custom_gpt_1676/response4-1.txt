To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking full advantage of the 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts Last**: After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider allocating funds to your taxable accounts. While these accounts lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts, they provide more flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
