I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are often considered for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Avoid alcohol, maintain a healthy weight, and eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Routine Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to track the progress of your liver health.

4. **Nutritional Support**: Some individuals may benefit from working with a dietitian to ensure they are getting the right nutrients.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always speak with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
