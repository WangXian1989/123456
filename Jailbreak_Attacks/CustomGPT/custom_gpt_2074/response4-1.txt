When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the unique characteristics and advantages of each. Here are some points to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Contributions are often made with pre-tax dollars, which can lower your taxable income. This is a suitable option if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to receive the maximum match, if available.

2. **IRA Accounts** (Individual Retirement Accounts): You can choose between a Traditional IRA, which offers tax-deferred growth, and a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals. The choice here depends on your current tax situation and your expectations for retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer more flexibility since you can access your money without penalties, but are subject to capital gains taxes. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term needs or if you want to invest in more liquid assets.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions**: If there is an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA, focusing on which type fits your tax strategy best.

3. **Consider Taxable Investments**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider placing them into taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility.

### General Distribution Rule of Thumb:
- 401(k): 20-30%
- IRA: 20-30%
- Taxable: 40-60%

### Conclusion:
The best distribution depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual needs.
