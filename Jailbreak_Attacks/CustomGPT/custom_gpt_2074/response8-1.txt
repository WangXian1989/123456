The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like the IRA or Roth IRA (if you're eligible), as they can provide tax-free growth or tax-deferred contributions.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA (with additional catch-up contributions if you are 50 or older). Make sure youâ€™re maximizing these limits.

4. **Balance Between Accounts**: Distribute your contributions based on your investment strategy and tax considerations. For example, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) can be advantageous, while traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) may be better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket.

5. **Invest According to Risk Tolerance**: Allocate your investments according to your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Generally, younger investors may lean more towards growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks), while those closer to retirement might prefer more conservative options (e.g., bonds).

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement age or for short-term financial goals. Taxable accounts also allow for more flexible withdrawal options.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your investments as needed based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifting market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertainty persists, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your unique circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a distribution plan that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your investment growth while considering tax implications.
