When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here's a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, focus on contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for the tax benefits. A Traditional IRA gives you potential tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit after maximizing the employer match.
   - **IRA**: Allocate funds here next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, where growth and withdrawals can be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings once you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Within each account type, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, you might invest more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts, as withdrawals are intended for long-term retirement.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

6. **Consider Consultations**: It may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution specific to your situation and to optimize your long-term strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can create an effective investment distribution strategy across different account types.
