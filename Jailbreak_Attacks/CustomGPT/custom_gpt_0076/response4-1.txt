Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out a Roth IRA next. Contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify**: Ensure a mix of stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications for withdrawals from each account type when planning for retirement.

6. **Adjust Contributions Based on Income**: As your income changes, adjust your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

7. **Regularly Reassess**: Revisit your allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan to your specific situation.
