Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match** (401(k))
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
     - A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, which may be beneficial if you are in a higher income bracket now.
     
### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: 
     - Use these for investments that may generate higher taxes, like bonds or frequent trading.
     - Prioritize holding low-turnover, tax-efficient investments here.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your income
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (currently $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your individual needs, focusing on a balance of long-term growth and tax efficiency.
