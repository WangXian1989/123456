To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute up to the limit if your budget allows or focus on traditional vs. Roth options based on your tax situation.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA may be better for immediate tax benefits.
   - Aim to maximize contributions within your budget.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional savings or investments after maxing out 401(k) and IRA if your financial situation allows.
   - Focus on investments that generate low taxes, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates for optimal withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Financial Goals**:
   - Align your distributions with short- and long-term financial goals.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
