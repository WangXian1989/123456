Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medical Treatments:**
   - **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, medications to manage symptoms or address underlying causes may be prescribed.
   - **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups to assess liver function.

3. **Advanced Options:**
   - **Surgery:** In serious cases, such as tumors, surgical intervention may be necessary.
   - **Transplant:** For end-stage liver disease, a liver transplant may be the last option.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
