To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing your 401(k), contribute to an IRA. Choose a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, contribute to a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate a lot of short-term capital gains (like stocks) and for money you'll need before retirement.

### 4. **Asset Location:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid capital gains taxes.
   - Hold more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may generate less taxable income.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.

By balancing contributions across these accounts wisely, you can enhance your long-term growth potential while minimizing taxes.
