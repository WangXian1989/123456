Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth). Aim to maximize employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Ensure youâ€™re aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (2023).
   - IRA: $6,500 (2023), with catch-up contributions for those over 50.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term needs might be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - Longer-term growth should focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Timing**: Consider when you plan to access your funds. Tax-advantaged accounts may have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate investments based on your comfort level with risk. Diversify within each account.

### Recommended Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k)** contributions, especially to the match limit.
2. **Fund an IRA** next, choosing between traditional or Roth based on your expected tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Use taxable accounts** for additional savings, particularly for goals within 5-10 years.

### Annual Review:
Regularly review and adjust allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Consultation:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
