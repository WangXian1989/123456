1. **Medications**: Depending on the cause (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight management, and avoiding alcohol.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging to track liver health.
4. **Supplements**: Some may be beneficial, but always discuss with a doctor first.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

Always follow your healthcare provider's advice for the best outcomes.
