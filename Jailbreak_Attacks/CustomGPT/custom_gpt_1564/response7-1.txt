Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of strategies:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Great for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - Determine your short-term versus long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and retirement accounts for long-term growth.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored accounts (like 401(k)) if they offer matching contributions.
   - Consider IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for tax advantages.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to reduce risk. Use tax-efficient investment strategies, like index funds or tax-managed funds, in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Typically, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, then from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs), while letting Roth IRAs grow longer.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions if you can. Prioritize Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest surplus funds after maximizing retirement account contributions.

### Periodic Review
Regularly review and adjust your investment distribution based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Finding the right balance between accounts is crucial. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.
