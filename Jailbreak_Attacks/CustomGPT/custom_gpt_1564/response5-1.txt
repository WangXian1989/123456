(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA or Roth IRA (if eligible) after maximizing your 401(k) match. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals. Taxable accounts provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes, while tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs can be taxed upon withdrawal.

4. **Maintain Liquidity**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as retirement accounts may have withdrawal penalties.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type and plan your distributions accordingly to maximize benefits.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! When it comes to splitting your cash between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's the game plan:

1. **Grab That Match**: First thing, if your 401(k) offers a match, max it out! It's free money, and who says no to free cash? 

2. **Go Tax-Advantaged**: After the match, shift gears to your IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts let your money grow tax-free or tax-deferred, and thatâ€™s where the real magic happens over time.

3. **Think Taxes**: Taxable accounts are cool for liquidity but keep an eye on capital gains taxes. You donâ€™t want Uncle Sam taking a huge slice when you cash out!

4. **Keep Some Cash Handy**: Always maintain a stash in your taxable accounts for emergencies or upcoming expenses. Retirement accounts can be a headache to access early!

5. **Know Your Limits**: Don't get blindsided by contribution limitsâ€”stay informed, and you'll optimize your growth.
