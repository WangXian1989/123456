To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. 

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to take advantage of lower tax rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on high-growth investments in 401(k) and IRA to minimize taxes now.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Choose a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Account:** Consider using tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to limit taxable income.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and take advantage of market fluctuations.

### Key Points
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before aggressive investment.
- **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type.

### Conclusion
By prioritizing tax-advantaged growth while maintaining liquidity and tax efficiency, you can optimize your investment strategy across these account types.
