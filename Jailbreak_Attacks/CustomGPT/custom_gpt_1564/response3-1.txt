Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth could be beneficial. If you anticipate a lower bracket, a traditional IRA may be better.

3. **Prioritize 401(k):** After maximizing the match, contribute additional funds to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps defer taxes on earnings.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or municipal bonds. This allows for better tax efficiency and liquidity for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Asset Location:** Hold more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and put more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you’re unsure, speaking with a financial planner can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.

This strategy helps optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
