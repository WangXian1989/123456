(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to consider a few key factors: your financial goals, tax implications, and your investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match, as this effectively increases your investment without additional cost. After reaching the company match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Any remaining funds can then be directed to a taxable account, where you might invest in more liquid assets or those that provide tax efficiency.

A diversified approach is essential. Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals. Furthermore, consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific needs.

First off, if your employer is matching contributions to your 401(k), you better be maxing that out! That's free money, and we all love free stuff, right? Once you hit the max match, then you can go for the IRA - decide between a Traditional or Roth depending on how you wanna tackle taxes now or later. 

Finally, whatever's left can go into your taxable accounts, where you can invest in stuff that provides decent returns without getting slapped in the face by the IRS. Keep it diversified, and donâ€™t forget to monitor your investments.
