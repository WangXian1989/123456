To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) plan offers an employer match, prioritize contributions to at least the amount needed to secure that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s before putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts can provide tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth.

3. **IRA Contributions:** If you qualify for a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, consider maxing out contributions to these accounts (up to $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs can be particularly effective for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. They allow for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of which investments to hold in taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts. For example, place bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** Review your allocations regularly and rebalance as needed to keep your investment strategy aligned with your financial goals.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:** Personal circumstances can significantly impact the best strategy. A financial advisor can help craft a tailored plan that considers your income, tax situation, and retirement goals.

These steps can help you optimize your savings across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for a more secure financial future.
