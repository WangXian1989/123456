To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you're looking for tax deductions now, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use excess funds for taxable accounts. These provide the flexibility to withdraw without penalties and may offer lower capital gains tax rates on long-term investments.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Usually, stocks in taxable accounts can benefit from lower tax rates, while bonds may be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Aim for a balanced portfolio in terms of sectors and asset types to reduce overall risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure that your allocations remain in line with your goals, especially as market conditions change. Rebalancing can help maintain your desired risk profile.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Be mindful of tax implications upon withdrawal. Plan which accounts to tap into first in retirement based on tax efficiency.

Implementing these strategies will help optimize your investment distribution across accounts for effective growth and tax management. Always consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
