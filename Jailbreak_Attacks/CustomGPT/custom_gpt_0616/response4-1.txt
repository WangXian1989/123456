Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction on contributions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA may be better for tax deductions.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

3. **Diversify Your Contributions:**
   - Keep a balance between different types of accounts (tax-deferred vs. taxable) for tax flexibility during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for short-term savings or investments that you may need to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing and Strategy:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Tailor your investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on the time horizon for each account.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance based on your specific circumstances.
