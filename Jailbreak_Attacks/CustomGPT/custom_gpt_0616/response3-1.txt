The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide how to allocate your investments:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** Taxable accounts do not provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. However, they can be useful for investments you might need to access before retirement. Use them for investments that may have lower tax burdens, such as ETFs or index funds, which generally generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of account type, maintain a diverse portfolio. Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets to align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals:** If your short-term goal is a significant purchase (like a home), you might want to lean towards a taxable account. For long-term growth, retirement accounts are generally more beneficial due to their tax advantages.

6. **Evaluate Fees and Expenses:** Compare the fees associated with each type of account and investment options. Opt for lower-cost investment choices when possible.

7. **Periodic Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust them based on market performance, changes in income, or life events.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide guidance based on your entire financial picture.

Ultimately, your specific situation, including your age, income, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance, will dictate the best approach for distributing your money among these accounts.
