I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Generally, treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition you have. Some common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** 
   - Adopting a healthy diet low in fats and sugars.
   - Avoiding alcohol and illicit drugs.
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications:**
   - Medications to manage underlying conditions (like hepatitis).
   - Supplements or vitamins for liver health (consult a doctor before starting).

3. **Therapies:** 
   - For conditions like fatty liver disease, weight loss and insulin sensitivity improvement can be effective.

4. **Surgery:** 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Regular Monitoring:** 
   - Follow-up with blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

Make sure to discuss all your symptoms and any treatments with your doctor to get the most appropriate advice.
