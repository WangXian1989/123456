To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Maximize contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for funds you may need before retirement. Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary rates, while long-term gains have favorable tax rates.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) (plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 for Roth, if eligible).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Choose investments wisely based on account type. Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits. More stable investments might be better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawals**:
   - Consider when you'll need access to funds. 401(k) and IRA accounts have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts allow more flexibility.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio within each account to manage risk effectively.

6. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Align your allocation with your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. If you're decades away from retirement, a more aggressive growth strategy may be suitable.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation and goals, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.

By systematically reviewing these factors, you can tailor your contributions for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
