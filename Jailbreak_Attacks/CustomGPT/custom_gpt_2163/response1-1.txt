To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, focus on contributing to your IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you're anticipating being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. If you think you'll be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be preferable.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

5. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Save your taxable accounts for assets that produce capital gains or that you might need to access before retirement, like savings for a home purchase or other short-term goals.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your investments to stay aligned with your goals, risk tolerance, and the time until you need to access the funds.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider getting personalized advice from a financial professional who can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your money this way, you'll be in a stronger financial position when you reach retirement.
