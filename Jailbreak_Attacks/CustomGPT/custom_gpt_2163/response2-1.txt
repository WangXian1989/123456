When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize your investment growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction in the contribution year.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Only invest in taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold, so consider holding assets that generate lower taxable income.
   - **Asset Location**: Place investments that generate high income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes. Conversely, consider putting stocks (which may appreciate) in taxable accounts for better tax treatment on long-term capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses) outside of these investment accounts to avoid needing to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely, which can incur penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Within each account, ensure a diverse asset allocation that matches your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio to make adjustments based on changing goals and market conditions. Rebalance your asset allocation as needed.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - If you're unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This distribution strategy can help you build wealth effectively while considering tax implications and risk management.
