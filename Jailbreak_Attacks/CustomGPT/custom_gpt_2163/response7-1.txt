The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize maxing out that match first. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to boost your retirement savings. After that, consider contributing enough to max out the annual limit if feasible.

2. **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits for those who qualify. Depending on your income, you may be eligible for tax deductions with a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have taken advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, you can distribute additional savings into a taxable brokerage account. This is particularly useful for money you may need before retirement or if you want to invest in assets that are not permitted in tax-advantaged accounts.

Overall, a common strategy could be:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Invest additional funds in your taxable accounts if you have extra savings.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your individual circumstances.
