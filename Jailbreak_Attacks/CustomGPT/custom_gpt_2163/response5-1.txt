(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial situation, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment preferences. Generally, you might consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions first. After that, it's usually beneficial to contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Lastly, any remaining funds can be directed to a taxable account. This approach ensures you maximize tax advantages while providing flexibility in accessing funds in the future.
