Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to at least get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits.

   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each type of account. For 2024, the limits are typically:
   - 401(k): $23,000 (under age 50) and $30,500 (age 50 and older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (under age 50) and $7,500 (age 50 and older)

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for more flexibility. This can be useful for short- to medium-term goals, as you can withdraw funds without penalty.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and goals. Typically:
   - Higher-risk investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-free.
   - More conservative investments (like bonds) could be allocated to taxable accounts to manage tax impacts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, then tax-free accounts last.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
