To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 in 2024, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals, often choosing higher-growth assets in this tax-advantaged account.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxable withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 in 2024, with an additional $1,000 for those 50 and older.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Use these accounts for investments that you expect to grow significantly over time.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use these for investments and savings outside of retirement accounts, which are more accessible without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have readily accessible funds for emergencies or short-term goals.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out your 401(k) contributions to the match, then fund your IRA, and lastly, invest in taxable accounts.
- **Diversification**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts, matching your risk tolerance.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix.

### Final Considerations:
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting a financial planner.

This balanced distribution helps optimize your tax situation while supporting long-term growth.
