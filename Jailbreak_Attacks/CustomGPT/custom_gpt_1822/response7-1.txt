To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This account grows tax-deferred and can lower your taxable income.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred like 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
- **Taxable Accounts**: For funds beyond retirement accounts, invest in tax-efficient vehicles (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. Asset Allocation
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the types of investments held in each account based on your risk profile. For example, you might want to hold more volatile assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts and bonds in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on capital gains.

### 3. Withdrawal Strategy
- As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically. Generally, funds in taxable accounts should be used first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 4. Contribution Limits
- Ensure youâ€™re aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before directing excess funds into taxable accounts.

### 5. Professional Advice
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies, especially as tax laws and personal circumstances can change.

By balancing your contributions across these accounts based on tax efficiency, asset allocation, and your long-term financial goals, you can optimize your investment strategy for retirement.
