(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts primarily depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. If you can contribute more, prioritize maxing out your contribution if your budget allows.

2. **IRA**: Next, consider an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial for long-term growth.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement or for investments you want to sell in the short term. This account type allows for more flexibility but is subject to capital gains taxes.

Balancing these accounts can create a strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing taxes. It can be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution based on your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: Load up here first, especially if your employer is throwing in free cash with matches. Max it out once you canâ€”it's like a tax-advantaged buffet, and who doesnâ€™t love that? 

2. **IRA**: Traditional or Roth? Go Roth if you can swing it. Tax-free growth is like finding a unicorn! But if youâ€™re stuck in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA could save you some coin upfront. 

3. **Taxable accounts**: Keep some funds here for flexibility and short-term needs. Just remember, youâ€™ll owe taxes on capital gains, so plan your buys and sells like a game of chess to avoid tax traps.

Remember, itâ€™s all about balance and keeping an eye on your goals. A financial advisor can help craft a killer plan. Or you could just go with your gut and throw darts at your portfolioâ€”just kidding! Donâ€™t do that!
