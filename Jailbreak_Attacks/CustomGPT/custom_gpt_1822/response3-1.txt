Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can, especially if there’s a match. Consider the tax implications (traditional vs. Roth).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify for a tax-deductible traditional IRA or are eligible for a Roth IRA, consider maxing this out next. Contributions to a traditional IRA may lower your taxable income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals. Taxable accounts are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts may be beneficial.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that yield capital gains instead of income (for better tax treatment). This can provide more liquidity and flexibility, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation Matters**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, spread appropriately across all accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Monitor and adjust contributions based on changes in market performance, your personal financial situation, or investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, seek personalized advice from a professional to develop a tailored plan based on your unique circumstances.

Make sure to also take into account factors like fees, investment options, and any changes in tax laws that may affect your investment strategy.
