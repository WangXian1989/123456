Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional) to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now.

2. **Balance Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since these are subject to capital gains taxes, consider using them for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Consider Investment Types**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less favorable tax treatment, such as high-yield bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs).

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing in these accounts. This fund should be in a liquid, easily accessible account.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your goals and market conditions. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Working with a financial planner can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Tailor these strategies based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline for the best results!
