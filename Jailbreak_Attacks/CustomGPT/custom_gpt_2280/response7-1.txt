The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, with potential employer matching. It's great for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-advantaged; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment options.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Higher income may suggest prioritizing tax-deferred accounts. Lower income years could be ideal for Roth contributions.

### 5. **Consider Your Investment Horizon:**
   - If you have a long time until retirement, you might leverage more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.

### 6. **Diversify Tax Exposure:**
   - Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to manage tax liabilities in retirement.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Account**: Use this for additional investments or short-term goals.

### Review and Adjust:
- Regularly reassess your allocation based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Itâ€™s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific situation.
