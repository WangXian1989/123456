Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial for tax deductions.

### 3. **Assess Investment Choices**
   - **401(k)**: Check the investment options available and their fees. Choose low-cost index funds if possible.
   - **IRA**: This account usually offers a wider array of investment choices compared to a 401(k).

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Consider strategically selling investments at a loss to offset gains.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before heavily funding retirement accounts.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to the Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds for short-term goals or additional retirement savings.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy will vary based on individual circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific needs and goals.
