Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're currently in a high tax bracket. Roth options (if available) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Decide based on your expected tax situation in retirement.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may be more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, since they typically generate fewer taxable events. This can provide flexibility for short-term needs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk. 

5. **Long-Term Growth**: If you have a longer time horizon, consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while maintaining a balanced approach in taxable accounts.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Monitor your investments regularly and adjust allocations based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
