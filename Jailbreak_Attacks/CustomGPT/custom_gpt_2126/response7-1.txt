The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. For 401(k) accounts, contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money." For IRAs, consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Consider Your Time Horizon:** If you have a long time until retirement, you might be able to take more risks in your 401(k) and IRA investments. In contrast, funds in taxable accounts may need to be more conservatively invested if you're planning to access them sooner.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure that all three types of accounts are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.). This helps mitigate risk while aiming for growth.

4. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of how investments are taxed. Taxable accounts may be better suited for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, while tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) might be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Adjust for Income Needs:** If you anticipate needing money in the short-term, keep enough liquidity in your taxable accounts to avoid penalties or taxes on early withdrawals from your retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual needs and circumstances.

**In Summary:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, diversify investments, and consider your time horizon and liquidity needs when distributing your funds.
