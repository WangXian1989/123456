I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition, but may include lifestyle changes, medications, or therapies as directed by a physician. Please seek medical attention for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
