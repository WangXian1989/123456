The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax considerations, current income, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **401(k) Account**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: 
     - Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
     - Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Try to contribute the maximum allowed each year to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them a good option for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment profits and consider using tax-efficient investment strategies (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This can protect you from needing to dip into retirement savings.
   - **Balance Accounts Based on Goals**: Allocate funds based on your short-term vs. long-term goals. For near-term goals, consider more stable investments in taxable accounts, while focusing on growth in retirement accounts.
   - **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.
