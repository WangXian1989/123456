The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on contributing as much as you can to your 401(k) and IRA because these accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth IRAs).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains and dividends, since these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: When you retire, consider your withdrawal strategy. Typically, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - **Consider Future Tax Brackets**: Analyze projected future tax brackets and strategize withdrawals from each account to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure that your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance. 
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation while considering tax implications.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **Stay Within Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts to maximize the potential growth without incurring penalties.

By considering these factors, youâ€™ll be able to strategically allocate your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for maximum benefit. It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
