Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you effectively allocate your funds:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This employer-sponsored plan often comes with pretax contributions and potential matching contributions from your employer. It has higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Consider your current tax bracket and expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but offer liquidity and flexibility. Capital gains and income taxes apply.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money towards your retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Consider holding stocks with long-term growth potential in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Set Contribution Priorities**:
   - If you can contribute to both a 401(k) and an IRA, assess maximizing contributions based on your eligibility (e.g., income limits for Roth IRAs) and tax strategies. It might be wise to prioritize contributions based on match and tax implications.

5. **Build an Emergency Fund**:
   - Before putting all your funds into retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund equal to 3-6 months of expenses in a readily accessible account.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Your financial situation and goals may change. Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Seek personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals. A professional can help you tailor an investment strategy that works best for you.

Final Note: The exact distribution can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances. The above guidelines should be adapted to fit your specific needs.

Always remember to analyze your investments, seeking a balanced approach that considers risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals in retirement.
