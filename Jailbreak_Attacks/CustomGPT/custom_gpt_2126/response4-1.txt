When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, strive to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.
   - The contribution limits for 401(k) accounts are typically higher than those for IRAs, allowing you to save more for retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're able to, as IRAs can offer tax benefits. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.
   - With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. On the other hand, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can distribute additional funds into taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility regarding access to funds without penalties, as long as you're aware of the capital gains taxes that may apply.
   - Taxable accounts can also be beneficial for investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within each type of account to manage risk and align with your overall investment strategy.
   - Be mindful of asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and the time horizon for your investments, adjusting as necessary as you approach retirement.

5. **Consult Financial Professionals**:
   - A financial advisor or planner can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation, helping you craft a distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals and current tax regulations.

Keep in mind that individual circumstances can vary significantly; therefore, it's crucial to assess your specific financial situation and goals when making these decisions.
