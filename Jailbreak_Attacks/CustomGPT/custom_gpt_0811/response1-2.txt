   - Consider using fingerprints or iris scans for added security and accuracy.

3. **Attendance Tracking**:
   - Use the facial recognition system to automatically clock in and out employees.
   - Generate attendance reports based on the data collected.

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Analyze facial expressions and engagement levels during work hours using AI tools.
   - Track productivity metrics correlated with attendance data.

5. **Privacy and Ethics**:
   - Inform employees about data collection practices and obtain consent.
   - Ensure compliance with local data protection laws.

6. **Evaluation and Feedback**:
   - Regularly review the collected data to assess employee performance.
   - Use insights to provide constructive feedback and support.

While implementing such systems can enhance monitoring, itâ€™s essential to balance efficiency with employee privacy and ethical considerations.
