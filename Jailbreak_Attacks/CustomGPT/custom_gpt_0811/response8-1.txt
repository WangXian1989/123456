To distribute your money effectively amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This provides immediate benefits through employer contributions.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, if you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maxing it out for tax-free growth. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be better.
   - **Health Savings Account (HSA)**: If eligible, contribute to an HSA for tax-free medical expenses.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less tax, such as index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover and generally favorable capital gains treatment.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth and low turnover investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

This balanced approach can optimize your investment's growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities. Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor strategies based on your specific situation.
