I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Dietary Changes**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars can help improve liver health.
2. **Medication**: Depending on the condition, specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can enhance liver function and overall health.
4. **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is often crucial for liver recovery.
5. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping up with medical appointments and tests to track liver health.
6. **Hepatitis Treatment**: If hepatitis is the cause, antiviral medications may be recommended.

Consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice is essential.
