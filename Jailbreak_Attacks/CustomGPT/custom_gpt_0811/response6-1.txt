Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments likely to generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Keep a mix of assets (stocks, bonds) in all accounts, but prioritize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts, which can benefit more from compounding.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust allocations based on changing market conditions and personal circumstances to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20-30% (max match)
- **IRA**: 15-20% (if eligible)
- **Taxable**: Remaining 50-65% (for liquidity and flexibility)

### Conclusion
Balancing these accounts effectively can enhance your overall returns while minimizing tax liabilities. Regular reviews and adjustments tailored to your situation are vital.
