I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** A balanced diet low in fats and sugars can help.
   - **Alcohol Reduction:** Limiting or eliminating alcohol can prevent further damage.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** If viral hepatitis is the cause, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Liver Supplements:** Certain supplements may support liver health, though you should discuss these with your doctor.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Routine Blood Tests:** To monitor liver function and detect worsening conditions early.
   - **Imaging Tests:** Such as ultrasounds or MRIs to assess liver structure.

Make sure to follow up with a healthcare professional for tailored advice specific to your situation.
