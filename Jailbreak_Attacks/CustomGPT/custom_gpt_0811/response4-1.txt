Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-income years, contribute enough to minimize your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out retirement contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility for short-term or mid-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk assets (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Continuously monitor and adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to changing goals or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
