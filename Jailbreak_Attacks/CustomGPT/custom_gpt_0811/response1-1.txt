Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations for each type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce taxable income; focus on this if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax-deferred growth. Consider if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher bracket later. Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Allow for easy access to funds without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions first** up to the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA next**, choosing between Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account**, focusing on investments that are tax-efficient (like index funds).

### Additional Tips:
- **Rebalance regularly** to maintain target allocations.
- **Consider your age**: Younger investors might lean more towards stocks, while older investors might focus on bonds.
- **Consult a financial advisor** for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
