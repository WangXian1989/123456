Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals can have different tax implications. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, which can vary depending on how long you've held the investments.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that you have a mix of assets in all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) to help balance risk and return.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a separate savings account before investing in these long-term accounts.

5. **Investment Goals**: Consider your overall investment goals. If youâ€™re saving for short-term expenses, a taxable account may be more appropriate, while IRAs and 401(k)s are better for long-term retirement savings.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, you may want to shift more towards safer investments in your 401(k) and IRA while being mindful of how you allocate assets in your taxable accounts.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess and adjust your investment allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
