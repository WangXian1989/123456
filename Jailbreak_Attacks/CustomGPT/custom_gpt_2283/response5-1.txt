(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, it can be beneficial to max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA first, as these accounts can help reduce your taxable income and grow your investments tax-deferred. 

In practice, consider the following strategies:
1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, be sure to contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to these retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts where you can have more flexibility for withdrawals.

Diversifying investments within each account is also crucial to manage risk effectively.

First up, you wanna stack some serious dough in that 401(k) and snag every penny of free money your employer throws your wayâ€”donâ€™t leave that on the table! Next, hit up the IRAâ€”traditional or Roth, whatever floats your boat and works best with your tax situation. You want that tax-advantaged growth, right?

After those are maxed out, itâ€™s time for the fun stuff: the taxable accounts. This is where you can play around a bit more since you have more control over withdrawals and can potentially access the cash without penalties before retirement age. But remember, you gotta keep an eye on taxes here since capital gains can bite you if youâ€™re not careful. Ultimately, just make sure youâ€™re spreading your investments around to balance that risk and keep growing your wealth like a boss!
