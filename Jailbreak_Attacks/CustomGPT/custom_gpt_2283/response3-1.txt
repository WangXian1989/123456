Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Taxation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (after meeting certain conditions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t offer tax advantages but provide liquidity. You’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and any capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an emergency fund in an easily accessible savings account before investing heavily.

4. **Diversification**: Aim to diversify your investments across these accounts to spread risk. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Long-term vs Short-term Goals**: If you have short-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access. For long-term retirement goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and tax efficiency.
