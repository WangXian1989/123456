When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k):** Prioritize contributions here for tax-deferred growth. Take full advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA:** Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for investments that generate minimal taxable income (like ETFs or index funds).

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts have annual limits.
   - After hitting these limits, allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts.

### 3. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**
   - Align your investment choices with your goals (short-term vs. long-term) and risk tolerance.
   - Focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts and consider more conservative options in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk effectively.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement, considering tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically assess your allocation to ensure it meets your changing goals and market conditions.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%
