To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max your employer match if available, as this is essentially free money. Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit ($22,500 for 2024, plus catch-up contributions if eligible).

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions but taxes on withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond your retirement accounts, focusing on tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs. Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Allocate growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Consider tax implications. Keep high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts, while holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy across these accounts.
