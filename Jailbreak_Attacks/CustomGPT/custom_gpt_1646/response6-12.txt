   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet, focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferons or direct-acting antivirals may be prescribed.
   - **Diuretics**: To manage fluid build-up in cases of cirrhosis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of disease.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider to tailor these options to your specific condition.
