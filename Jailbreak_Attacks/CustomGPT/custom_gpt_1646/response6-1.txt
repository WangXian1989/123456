To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match:** This ensures you take full advantage of free money.
- **Max out your IRA contributions:** Focus on a Roth IRA if you expect higher income in retirement for tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. Assess Your Investment Goals
- **Long-term growth:** Allocate more in stocks within tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Short-term needs:** Keep liquid assets in taxable accounts for easy access.

### 3. Diversify Across Accounts
- **401(k):** High-growth mutual funds or ETFs, considering your risk tolerance.
- **IRA:** A mix of stocks and bonds to balance growth and stability.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, adjusting each account as needed based on market performance.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can enhance your tax efficiency and achieve your financial objectives more effectively.
