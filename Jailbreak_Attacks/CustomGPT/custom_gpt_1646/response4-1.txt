To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: This account has tax advantages; contributions are often pre-tax, potentially lowering your taxable income now. Focus on maximizing contributions.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, consider contributing to it as well. The Roth option offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and liquidity, although they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) in your taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.
   - Use bonds or conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax implications on interest income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and potential returns.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
