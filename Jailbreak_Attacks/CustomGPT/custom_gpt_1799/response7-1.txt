Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial health. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Contribution Limits:** Maximize your contributions here first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
- **Investment Options:** Choose a diverse range of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your expected tax situation.
- **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits and adjust accordingly.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility and Access:** These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and donâ€™t have early withdrawal penalties.
- **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### Recommended Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Matches:** Start with contributions to your 401(k) to capture any employer matching.
2. **Fund the IRA:** Next, consider fully funding your IRA (preferably Roth if eligible).
3. **Back to 401(k):** After maxing out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting for changes in risk tolerance or financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
