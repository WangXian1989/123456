To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After securing the match, consider contributing the max allowed to your 401(k) for its tax advantages. High-income earners benefit significantly from this pre-tax contribution.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. Roth contributions grow tax-free, while Traditional IRA contributions may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, turn to taxable accounts. This can be an effective way to invest if you need more flexibility or want to invest in non-retirement assets.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Ensure your investment allocations align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Consider a general rule: stock-heavy investments may perform better in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds and income-generating assets may be better suited for taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio distribution based on performance and life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to get personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best strategy depends on your individual circumstances, including income level, retirement goals, and tax situation.
