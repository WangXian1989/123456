Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) and pay down high-interest debt.

3. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Further Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing contributions to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) as it provides potential tax advantages.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable brokerage accounts. They offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

6. **Adjust Based on Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If you’re closer to retirement, prioritize accounts that offer immediate tax benefits.

8. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Your situation will change over time, so review and adjust your allocations regularly.
