To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Best for tax-deferred growth, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), it provides tax-deferred growth. Consider this if youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contribute here if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or for investments you expect to sell within a few years. Favor tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Consider placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: They can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.

This balanced approach maximizes growth potential while considering tax implications.
