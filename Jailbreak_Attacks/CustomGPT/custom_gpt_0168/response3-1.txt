Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here's a general guide:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement account; can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in non-retirement accounts subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. Choose between a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

### 3. **Invest for Growth**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - Keep your taxable accounts for more liquid investments that might generate taxable income.

### 4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - **Retirement Nearing**: Shift assets to more conservative investments (bonds, cash).
   - **Long-Term Growth**: More aggressive allocations (stocks) in retirement accounts, adjusting taxable accounts based on your income needs.

### 6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocation at least annually or when there are significant life changes (job change, inheritance).

### Conclusion:
Distributing your money effectively across these accounts can maximize growth while minimizing taxes. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
