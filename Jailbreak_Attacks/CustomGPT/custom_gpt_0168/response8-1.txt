Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs. For 2023, it's $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA:** Contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Max out contributions to the 401(k)** if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA** based on your income level and tax situation.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax (Traditional), reducing taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Can be either Traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. Ideal for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs) and allocate based on risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** May consider interest-bearing accounts or municipal bonds to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on performance and changes in income, tax laws, or personal circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation and goals.

Make sure to tailor these suggestions based on your own financial situation and goals.
