I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol, processed foods, and excessive fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: If hepatitis is the cause, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These can help reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and adjust treatments as necessary.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may find benefits from supplements like milk thistle, but consult with a doctor first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
