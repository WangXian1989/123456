To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - Maximize employer matching in your 401(k) first for free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if considering a Roth for tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings if you've maxed out other accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Favor growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Income Generation:** Hold income-generating assets in taxable accounts to optimize tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

### Conclusion
- **Create a Balanced Approach:** Distribute your money considering tax strategies, investment timelines, and personal financial goals to maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities. 

Remember, personal circumstances vary, so consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
