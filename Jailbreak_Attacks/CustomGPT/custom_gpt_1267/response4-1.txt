To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Use this for higher contributions due to higher contribution limits.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider this if you want tax deductions now or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, benefiting from lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to minimize risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Align your investments with when you plan to access the funds, balancing risk accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Assess your financial goals and adapt your strategy as needed.
