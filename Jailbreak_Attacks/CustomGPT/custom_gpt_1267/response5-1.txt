Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: If you can afford it, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can be put into taxable accounts, especially if you need flexibility for withdrawals. Investment options in these accounts can include stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may be more favorable if you’re investing for the short term or have a lower income for the year. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax implications.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
