When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, maximizing tax advantages.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Use traditional accounts (like 401(k)s) if you want to lower your taxable income now.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time horizons can afford more risk; consider stock-heavy investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - In taxable accounts, consider more stable investments to avoid short-term capital gains.

4. **Withdrawals in Retirement**:
   - Strategically withdraw from accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Start with taxable accounts, then use tax-deferred accounts, and retire with Roth IRAs last if possible.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for risk and time horizon.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Reassess your distribution regularly based on market performance and personal financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor may also help tailor strategies to your specific situation.
