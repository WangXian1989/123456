Distributing money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement age or for additional growth. This is also where you could hold investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. 
   - Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified, spreading risk across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and geographic regions.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering changing market conditions and personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your entire financial picture.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
