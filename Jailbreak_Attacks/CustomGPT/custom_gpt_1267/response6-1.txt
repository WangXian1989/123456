To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon
   - **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA for tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. Understand Tax Implications
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits to a 401(k), but check contribution limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Tax-free growth; ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax; consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### 3. Diversification Strategy
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments in each account based on risk tolerance.
   - **Use Tax-Efficient Funds**: Prefer index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to reduce taxable distributions.

### 4. Maximize Contributions
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (check income limits).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for additional investing.

### 5. Rebalance Annually
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust allocations to align with your goals and market changes.

These strategies can help optimize your overall investment approach while considering tax implications and individual financial goals.
