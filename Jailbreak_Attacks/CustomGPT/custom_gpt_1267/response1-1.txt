Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a great place to start, especially if you have a high income and want to lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts for more liquidity and investment flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. Consider placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
