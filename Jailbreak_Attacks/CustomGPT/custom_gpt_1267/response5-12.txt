I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general avenues for liver treatment. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice. 

Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol can prevent further damage.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function and health.

4. **Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult your healthcare provider for a personalized plan of action.
