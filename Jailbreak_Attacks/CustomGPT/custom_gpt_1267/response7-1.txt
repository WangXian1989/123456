To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred, often with employer matching. Best for higher contributions and compound growth.
   - **IRA:** Also tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Choose based on current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax. Good for flexible access and investing outside retirement plans.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions:** If eligible, prioritize Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals:** Use these for liquidity and investment flexibility.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Assessment:** Adjust your investment choices based on your risk tolerance, age, and retirement timeline.
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

### 4. **Review and Rebalance:**
   - **Monitor Performance:** Regularly assess your portfolio and adjust allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### 5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Harvest Tax Losses:** In taxable accounts, consider selling losing investments to offset gains.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
