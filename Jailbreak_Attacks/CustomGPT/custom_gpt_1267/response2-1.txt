To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to it until you reach the employer match.
   - **IRA**: After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

3. **Invest for Growth**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments, as these accounts benefit from tax deferral (or tax-free growth in Roth IRAs).

4. **Pay Attention to Taxes**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends at favorable tax rates, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals, ensuring you're not overly concentrated in one area.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Younger investors often benefit from more aggressive investments, while those nearing retirement may want to shift to more conservative options.

7. **Keep an Eye on Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your savings effectively.

Finally, consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.
