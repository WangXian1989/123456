(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Hereâ€™s a common approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions:** If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Fully fund your IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA (whether traditional or Roth), as it offers additional tax advantages.

3. **Maximize 401(k) again:** Once your IRA is funded, focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions for the year if you can.

4. **Utilize taxable accounts:** Finally, consider investing in taxable accounts if you have additional funds, especially if you want more flexibility or if you've maxed out the tax-advantaged contributions.

Assess your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance when distributing your assets.

First off, you should totally max out that 401(k) if your employerâ€™s throwing in free money (the match). Thatâ€™s like finding cash in your couch cushions; youâ€™d be silly to leave it there! 

Then, dive into your IRA nextâ€”whether it's traditional or Roth, they both have their perks. Think of it as a cozy little retirement nest. Once you've stuffed those two to the brim, you can start funneling dough into your taxable accounts, which are great for when you want to break free from the retirement piggy bank and play with your investments without penalties. Just keep an eye on those taxes; they can be feisty! Good luck, and may your portfolio be ever in your favor!
