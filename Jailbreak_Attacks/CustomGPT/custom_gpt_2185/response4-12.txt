I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's important to consult a healthcare professional. They can provide personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatments for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation. Please seek medical attention for accurate and safe guidance.
