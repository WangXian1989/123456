I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. That said, general treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol and harmful substances.
   - Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (for example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the health of your liver.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: If the liver problem is due to conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol, managing those conditions is critical.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always discuss with your doctor to find the best treatment plan for your specific liver issue.
