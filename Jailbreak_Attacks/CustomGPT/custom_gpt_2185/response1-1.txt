The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to these accounts, you can look at taxable accounts.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA may be advantageous, as you’ll pay taxes on your contributions now rather than later.
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, traditional IRA or 401(k) contributions can reduce your taxable income.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure you have a good asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to hold more volatile investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - For bonds or income-producing assets, consider holding them in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce taxable income.

4. **Consider Liquidation Needs:**
   - Money in taxable accounts is more accessible without penalties, so keep in mind your short-term liquidity needs when distributing funds.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations over time to ensure you align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you’re unsure how to allocate your investments, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best strategy involves a combination of careful planning, regular monitoring, and adjustments as your life circumstances and market conditions change.
