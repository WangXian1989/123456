The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while for IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: Assess whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement. If you think your tax rate will increase, consider prioritizing Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversity of Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Your 401(k) may offer limited investment options, so use your IRA and taxable accounts for additional diversification.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement or for short-term goals, as they do not have the same restrictions as retirement accounts.

6. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that down before maximizing retirement contributions.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Revisit your investment strategy and asset allocation regularly to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your circumstances.

Make sure to evaluate your unique situation when making these decisions, as individual needs can vary greatly.
