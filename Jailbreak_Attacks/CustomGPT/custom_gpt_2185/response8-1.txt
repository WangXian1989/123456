The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some generalized guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, then consider maxing out this account as it grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a deductible Traditional IRA or prefer a Roth IRA (which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement), allocate funds here after maxing out your 401(k) contribution.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: If you plan to access the money before retirement, then prioritize investing in taxable accounts. This is especially relevant if you expect to need funds for goals like buying a home or funding education.

4. **Balance Risk and Return**: Diversify your investments within each account type based on risk tolerance. Younger investors might focus on growth-oriented assets (stocks), while those closer to retirement may prefer more conservative investments (bonds).

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) will be taxed upon withdrawal. 
   - Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so consider your expected tax bracket when investing here.

6. **Consultation**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique financial situation and objectives.

By using these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to efficiently distribute your funds across these accounts to maximize growth and minimize tax implications.
