Live Deeply! Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a crucial part of your financial strategy. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Employer Match First**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money!

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of any employer match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs can give you tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Brackets**: Look at your current tax bracket. If you're in a lower tax bracket, contributing to a Roth IRA might be beneficial for the long term.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure to have a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start putting money into taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may come with tax implications on earnings.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Don’t forget to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before overly investing—typically, 3-6 months of expenses in an accessible account can provide peace of mind.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation. Each individual's circumstances can be different, so aligning your distribution with your goals and risk tolerance is key.
