Live Deeply! Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding your financial goals, tax implications, and the specific benefits of each account type. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Assess Your Retirement Goals**:
   - Determine when you plan to retire and what kind of lifestyle you envision. 

2. **Maximize Employer Matching**:
   - If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, always contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money!

3. **Understand Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (lowering your taxable income) and grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide similar tax advantages as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t offer tax advantages upfront, but you pay capital gains taxes only when you sell investments for a profit.

4. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match, then max out your IRA contributions (especially a Roth IRA if you qualify). After that, funnel additional savings into your 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your needs.

5. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Typically, long-term investments should be held in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA), while more accessible funds (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts to manage tax implications better.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to adapt to changing financial situations or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you can, work with a professional who can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your savings and prepares you better for retirement. Feel free to dive deeper into any of these areas!
