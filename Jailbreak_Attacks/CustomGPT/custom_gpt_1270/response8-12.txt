It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. However, general treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial for managing any liver disease.

4. **Supportive Treatments**: This may include nutritional support or therapy for related symptoms (like managing fatigue or gastrointestinal issues).

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as cirrhosis or liver cancer, surgical options or potential liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for tailored advice and treatments.
