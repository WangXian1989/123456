Live Deeply! Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a crucial step in your financial planning. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free, respectively. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be particularly advantageous since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility, but capital gains will be taxable.

3. **Balance Your Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your financial goals to ensure you're not too heavily weighted in one account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals for retirement carefully; utilizing tax-efficient strategies can minimize taxes and prolong the lifespan of your accounts.

Ultimately, tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. It may also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to develop a plan that aligns with your needs.
