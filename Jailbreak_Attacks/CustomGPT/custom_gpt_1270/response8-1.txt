Finding the optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well. Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize Contributions by Tax Impact**:
   - **Contribute to tax-deferred accounts** (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA) first, which can help reduce your taxable income now.
   - If your income falls within eligible limits, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals later.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**:
   - Consider the types of investments in each account. Taxable accounts are better suited for investments that are less tax-sensitive, such as low turnover index funds or long-term investments. 
   - Investments generating ordinary income (like bonds or REITs) may be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Monitor Your Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep a consistent overall asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, regardless of the account type.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired allocation.

5. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw funds. Tax treatment will differ based on the account, so strategize to minimize taxes during withdrawal.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy that meets your long-term financial goals.
