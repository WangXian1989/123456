Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maxed it out yet, continue contributing until you reach your limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2023, plus $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax preferences. The annual limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you'll need in the short-term or if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Account Type**: Consider putting higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.
   
5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax bracket.

This strategy balances immediate benefits with long-term growth potential while considering tax efficiency.
