When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After hitting the match, focus on funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. For a Roth IRA, contributions grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA can be more beneficial. In higher brackets, a Traditional IRA might offer better upfront tax breaks.

4. **Diversify Tax Exposure**: Keep some investments in taxable accounts for flexibility and to manage taxes more effectively, as long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth, while holding more stable, income-producing assets in taxable accounts to optimize tax treatment.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios across these accounts to ensure alignment with your long-term goals.

7. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to manage your tax exposure effectively.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
