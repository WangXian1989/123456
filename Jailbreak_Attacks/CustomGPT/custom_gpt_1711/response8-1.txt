Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you benefit from tax deferral. Consider traditional vs. Roth based on your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional money into taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, stocks are better suited for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This strategy aims to optimize growth while minimizing taxes.
