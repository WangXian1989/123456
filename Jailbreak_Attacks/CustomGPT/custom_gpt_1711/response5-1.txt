Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings and investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Best for higher income years as withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement; contributions are taxed, but growth is tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Useful for short-term goals and flexibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation to Match Goals:**
   - **Long-term**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid or conservative investments.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   Personal circumstances vary, so professional guidance can help you develop a tailored strategy.
