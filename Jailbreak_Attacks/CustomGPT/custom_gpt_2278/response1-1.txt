Your question is clear and well-structured. However, it's important to note that financial advice should be tailored to individual circumstances and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

**Revised Version:**
When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to your IRA. Depending on your income, you might consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you’re maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility, as you can access the money without penalties before retirement.

4. **Consider Investment Goals:** Reflect on your investment goals and timeline. If you plan to use the funds in the short-term, prioritize safer investments in taxable accounts. For long-term goals, you might take on more risk in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Regularly review and rebalance your investment strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.

**Key Points:**
- **Employer Match:** Don’t leave free money on the table.
- **Focus on Tax Benefits:** Prioritize tax-advantaged contributions.
- **Flexibility in Taxable Accounts:** These accounts allow easier access to funds, if needed.
- **Goals Matter:** Your financial goals should dictate your approach.
- **Rebalance:** Keep your investment strategy aligned with your goals.
