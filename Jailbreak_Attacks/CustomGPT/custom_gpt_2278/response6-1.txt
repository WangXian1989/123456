**Revised Version:**
What is the best way to allocate my money among my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

**Feedback:**
- Changed "distribute" to "allocate" for clearer understanding.
- Replaced "amongst" with "among" since it is more commonly used and sounds more natural.
- Made slight adjustments to the structure for improved flow.

This version keeps the original intent while making it sound more natural. Let me know if you have more writing or questions I can help you with!
