Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the IRS contribution limit. Consider traditional contributions for immediate tax savings or Roth contributions for tax-free growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your current and expected future tax rates. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investment options. 

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Generally, focus on a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax burdens, like municipal bonds or index funds, which can minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset distribution and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or investment performance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
