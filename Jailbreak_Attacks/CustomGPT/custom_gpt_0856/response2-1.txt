Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored Plans First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contribution. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction now.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or for long-term investments held for more than a year to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) and taxable accounts for safer, income-generating investments (e.g., bonds).

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account contributions and market performance.

6. **Plan for Withdrawal**:
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy for retirement, keeping in mind the tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's beneficial to work with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.

By following these principles and regularly reviewing your financial situation, you can optimize the distribution of your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
