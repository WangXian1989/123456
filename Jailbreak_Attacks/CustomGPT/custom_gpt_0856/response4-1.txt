Determining the best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After getting the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA and/or Roth IRA. IRAs can provide tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals, depending on the type.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, while tax-advantaged accounts defer taxes until withdrawal (or provide tax-free growth). Generally, itâ€™s advisable to hold investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts before maxing out contributions to retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts and growth stocks in taxable accounts to manage tax liability efficiently.

6. **Adjust for Retirement Timeline**:
   - If retirement is many years away, lean towards higher-risk, higher-reward investments in tax-advantaged accounts. As you approach retirement, consider a more conservative approach.

7. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes to minimize risk.

8. **Annual Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
