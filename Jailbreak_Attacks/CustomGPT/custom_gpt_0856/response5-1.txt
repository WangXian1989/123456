Creating an effective distribution strategy for your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key considerations: your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to capture the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep in mind that tax treatment can influence your investment choices. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Tax Bracket Consideration**: 
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, it might make sense to prioritize Roth contributions, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Traditional accounts might be more beneficial.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you get closer to retirement, strategize about withdrawals from these accounts to manage tax implications while ensuring you have enough liquidity.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary. 

6. **Consulting a Financial Planner**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

Always tailor your strategy to fit your unique financial landscape and preferences.
