Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowable limit to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments with high expected returns or those that generate high income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Utilize losses in taxable accounts to offset gains and reduce your tax burden.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawals:**
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw from these accounts. Generally, youâ€™ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations as your financial situation or goals change, ensuring they remain aligned with your evolving needs.

Before making any decisions, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an approach that fits your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach, leveraging the benefits of each account type, while accounting for your unique financial situation, is essential for optimizing your investment strategy.
