To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Use your 401(k) and IRA contributions first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Aim to max out the contributions yearly if possible.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for funds you might need soon. They’re more flexible but come with capital gains taxes.
   - **IRA and 401(k)**: Grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals in retirement can be managed for tax efficiency.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth assets, such as stocks or mutual funds, since you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, which can have favorable tax treatment.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation periodically based on market performance and your changing risk tolerance.

6. **Professional Advice**: Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.

This diversified approach can help you optimize your returns while considering your liquidity and tax implications.
