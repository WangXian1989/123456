When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth on withdrawals, but contributions are made with post-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for investments with higher liquidity and strategic tax management. Capital gains and dividends are taxed each year, so keep potential tax impacts in mind.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that within each account type, your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on when you plan to withdraw funds. Longer-term investments can be more aggressive, while those needed in the near term should be more conservative.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

6. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, favoring Roth accounts can be advantageous. Conversely, if you anticipate a lower bracket, Traditional accounts may be better.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account before heavily investing.

In summary, start with employer matches, weigh tax implications, diversify your investments, consider your timeline, and regularly rebalance to achieve an effective distribution strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances can also be beneficial.
