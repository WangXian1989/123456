When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, liquidity needs, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), be sure to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is effectively free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: If you have additional funds available, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth and can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any surplus funds after maximizing the above options can be directed to a taxable account. This provides more liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when buying and selling investments.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider diversifying your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. For example, you may want to take more risks in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where growth is preferred, while keeping more conservative investments in your taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your account allocations and make adjustments as needed based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances and to help optimize your overall investment plan.
