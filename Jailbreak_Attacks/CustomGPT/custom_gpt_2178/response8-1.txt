The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for when you plan to access these funds. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, distributions are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - Taxable accounts do not provide the same tax benefits but offer more flexibility when it comes to withdrawals.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) to minimize taxes.
   - Consider holding investments with lower turnover in your taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternatives.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Consistently contribute to each account based on your financial strategy and personal budget.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so itâ€™s important to periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

In summary, use tax-advantaged accounts strategically, consider your tax implications, and maintain a diversified investment approach to optimize your overall portfolio distribution.
