I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. Itâ€™s important to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. Here are some common treatment approaches based on the type of liver condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis), antiviral medications or other drugs may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function through blood tests and imaging studies are crucial.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant or procedures to remove bile ducts obstruction may be necessary.

5. **Dietary Supplements**: Some might benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but it's essential to discuss these with a healthcare provider first.

For the most accurate advice, please see a medical professional who can evaluate your specific situation.
