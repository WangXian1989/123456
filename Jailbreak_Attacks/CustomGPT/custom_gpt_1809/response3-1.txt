Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first.

2. **Consider Tax implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, but withdrawals are taxed. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are after-tax.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which may be lower than ordinary income rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRAs) for investments that have higher expected returns, as these are likely to grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Place lower-growth investments or those that generate income (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

4. **Age and Retirement Timeline**:
   - Younger investors may prioritize growth in 401(k) and IRA accounts.
   - Nearing retirement? Shift towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while ensuring liquidity in your taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can ensure your strategy aligns with your individual circumstances.

Assess your unique situation, and adjust these recommendations as necessary.
