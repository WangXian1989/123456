Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts efficiently depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, investment preferences, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer matching, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out contributions (up to the limit set by the IRS).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it ideal for younger savers or those expecting higher future tax rates.
  
### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) rather than income (like bonds) to minimize taxes on dividends and interest. 
   - Utilize capital losses to offset taxable gains if you have investments that have declined in value.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Allocate funds across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 
   - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy for retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRAs), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRAs).

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts requires careful consideration of your personal financial situation, goals, and investment strategy. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your circumstances change.
