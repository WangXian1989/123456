Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Matching Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, so prioritize this if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Favor this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have sufficient savings for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match, then fund an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts.
3. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.
