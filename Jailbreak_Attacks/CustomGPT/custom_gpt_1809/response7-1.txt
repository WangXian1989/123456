Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRAs, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Focus on this if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Also tax-deductible in many cases, similar to a 401(k).

### 3. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Your Needs**
   - **Short-term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need sooner (like buying a home or funding a major expense).
   - **Long-term Growth:** Max out tax-advantaged accounts first for long-term retirement savings.

### 4. **Assess Asset Allocation**
   - Stock-heavy investments may be better in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Fixed income investments can be suitable for taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor your investments annually and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, considering your unique financial situation, involving a financial advisor can help maximize your strategy.

Balancing these accounts based on your specific situation will help you grow your wealth over time while optimizing your tax situation.
