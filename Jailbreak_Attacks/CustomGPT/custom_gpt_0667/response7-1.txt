Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals and can hold investments that might benefit from favorable capital gains treatment.

3. **Diversification of Tax Treatment**:
   - A balanced approach might involve putting a mix of assets in each type of account based on how long you expect to hold them and your planned tax strategy.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Pay attention to the types of investments included in each account. For example, it may be beneficial to hold higher-growth, more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks), while keeping stable income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, consider gradually shifting toward more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - If you have a longer timeline, you might prioritize growth assets in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, your asset allocation may drift due to market movements. Regularly rebalancing can help maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This strategy should provide a good balance of growth potential while considering tax implications and withdrawal flexibility.
