Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Max out 401(k):**
   - If you're able, contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) after securing the match. This reduces your taxable income and accelerates your retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, allowing for favorable tax treatment. This can include index funds or ETFs.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - For long-term goals, lean more towards tax-advantaged accounts. For medium-term goals, a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial.

6. **Diversification and Risk Assessment:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and evaluate your risk tolerance. Generally, more aggressive investments may go into your tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Withdrawals Strategy:**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, addressing which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes.

8. **Revisit Annually:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and goals change.
