Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax rate, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth IRA if your income allows, as this offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends at lower tax rates. This can include stocks or mutual funds that you may hold long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### 3. **Diversify Across Account Types**
   - Distributing funds across all account types can help manage tax liabilities and provide flexibility for withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Update your contributions based on life changes (e.g., salary increases, changes in financial goals) and market conditions.

### 5. **Work with a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your investment strategy to align with your specific financial goals and risk tolerance.

By balancing contributions to these accounts and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy for long-term growth and retirement readiness.
