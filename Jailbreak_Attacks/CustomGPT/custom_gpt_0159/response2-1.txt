Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the specifics of each account type. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start there. Contributing enough to get the full match is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: After capitalizing on the match, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if it offers low-cost investment options.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you can contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA could be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. Keep in mind that investments here are subject to capital gains tax and may not provide the same tax advantages.
   - **Bond Allocation**: If you're investing in bonds, consider holding them in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates on interest income.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation across accounts is diversified based on your risk tolerance. Avoid concentrating too much in one type of investment or account.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consider Your Timeline**:
   - **Short-term Goals**: For goals within the next 5-10 years, you might prefer keeping more liquid assets in taxable accounts or stable investments within your 401(k) or IRA.
   - **Long-term Goals**: For retirement savings, aggressive growth through stocks in tax-advantaged accounts may be preferable.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you near retirement, plan your withdrawals in a tax-efficient manner. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial advisor can help you develop a strategy that considers your unique financial situation and goals.

This approach allows for flexibility while maximizing tax efficiency over the long term.
