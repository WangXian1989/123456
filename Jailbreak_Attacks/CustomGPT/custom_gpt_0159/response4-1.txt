Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Types of IRAs:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). Your choice may depend on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Max Contributions:** Aim to maximize your contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalty, unlike retirement accounts which may have restrictions.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes, and consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax implications.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to optimize for growth and income. Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liability.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan ahead for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Be strategic about which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you are unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific goals and situation.

It's crucial to assess your current financial status, risk tolerance, and future goals when deciding how to allocate your money across these accounts.
