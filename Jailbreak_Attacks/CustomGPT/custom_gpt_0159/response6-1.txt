To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Focus on Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest in growth-oriented assets (like stocks) for long-term growth since you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), you might also lean towards growth, understanding that Roth IRAs can provide tax-free income in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize for investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or municipal bonds) to manage the tax implications of capital gains and dividends.

3. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**:
   - Ensure that your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it can be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize your tax burden in retirement.

5. **Stay Informed and Adjust Accordingly**:
   - Regularly review your investment performance and adjust your distribution as needed based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

By strategically distributing your contributions and maintaining an efficient asset allocation, you can optimize your overall investment portfolio for both growth and tax efficiency.
