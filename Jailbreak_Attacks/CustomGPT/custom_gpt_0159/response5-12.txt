Some common liver problems include fatty liver disease, hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Treatment options may involve lifestyle changes such as adopting a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may be prescribed depending on the liver condition, and in severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Depending on what's going on, your treatment can range from cutting down on greasy foods and booze (like, seriously, help your liver out!) to possibly getting some meds if things are really sideways.
