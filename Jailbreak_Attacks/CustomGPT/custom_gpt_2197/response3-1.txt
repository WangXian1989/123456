Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeframe, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before directing funds to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Both Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages. A Traditional IRA provides a tax deduction on contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments like bonds or high-dividend stocks, which are less tax-efficient and may incur higher taxes if held in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance. This can help in achieving steady growth and managing risk.

5. **Review Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-advantaged accounts, depending on your tax situation.

6. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so review your account distributions and investment strategies periodically to ensure they align with your current needs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best approach for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your goals and financial circumstances.

In conclusion, a balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while considering your overall investment strategy is often the best way to distribute money among your accounts.
