When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have access to a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. Focus on this if you have high-income in the current year, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth contributions can be beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility in accessing funds and can be beneficial for long-term investments.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account to manage risk. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help ride out market volatility.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Your investment strategy may vary based on how far you are from retirement. If you're young, you can afford to take more risks; as you get closer to retirement, you might want to shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investment allocations and adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

It’s often a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your unique situation.
