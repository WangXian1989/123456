The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional) after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Tax Considerations:** Taxable accounts can be more flexible for accessing funds but are subject to capital gains taxes. Investments in taxable accounts should focus on tax-efficient funds or investments to minimize taxes, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification:** Aim to diversify your investments across all accounts. Use tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) for higher-growth investments, as you won’t pay taxes on those until withdrawal. Use taxable accounts for investments expected to have lower growth or those that generate income that will be taxed.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation. This can help manage risk and ensure your investments align with your goals.

6. **Long-Term Strategy:** Consider your retirement timeline. If you’re years away from retirement, you might prefer growth-focused investments. If retirement is approaching, you might want to shift towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexity of individual circumstances, it may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan specific to your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, balancing contributions across these accounts can help you attain your retirement goals while optimizing for taxes and growth potential.
