Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications
- **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (with a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50). Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
- **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 catch-up) for 2023. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

### 2. Determine Your Investment Goals
- **Long-term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize growth.
- **Flexibility**: Use a taxable account for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for short-term financial goals.

### 3. Create a Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts.
- **Balance Contributions**: After maxing out any matches, consider putting additional funds into an IRA, with a focus on Roth accounts for tax-free growth.
- **Fill Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that generate income or for future expenses, such as buying a home or funding education.

### 4. Regularly Review and Adjust
- **Rebalance Portfolio**: Annually review your allocations and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
- **Tax Management**: In a taxable account, consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains and minimize tax liabilities.

### Conclusion
By assessing your contributions, understanding tax implications, and aligning with your goals, you can devise an efficient strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
