The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to at least get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Also offers potential tax deductions upfront, but taxes are due upon withdrawal. Alternatively, a Roth IRA involves post-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on realized gains, dividends, and interest. They offer more flexibility but less favorable tax treatment compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure a portion of your savings is liquid (i.e., in a taxable account or savings account) for unexpected expenses.

4. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**: 
   - If your goal is retirement, consider maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts if you anticipate high returns, as these will compound without immediate tax implications.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation remains diversified across different account types to balance tax efficiency and risk.

It's often beneficial to review your strategy periodically or consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
