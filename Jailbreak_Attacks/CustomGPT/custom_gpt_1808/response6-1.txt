When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Ensure you are contributing enough to receive your employer's full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Investment Options**: Choose investments that have lower fees and higher growth potential within your 401(k) to maximize returns over the long term.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Deductibility**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductibility.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Assess whether a Roth IRA may be beneficial based on your expected future tax rate versus your current rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Flexibility**: Maintain a balance in this account for liquidity needs or short-term goals, as it allows for easier access to funds without penalty.

**General Distribution Advice**:
- **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess and rebalance your allocations according to market performance and changes in personal circumstances.

Ultimately, the specific distribution depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance.
