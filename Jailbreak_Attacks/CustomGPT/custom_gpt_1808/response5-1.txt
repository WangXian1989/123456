(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Generally, it's beneficial to max out contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match. Following that, you can contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax-advantaged growth. Any additional savings can then go into your taxable accounts. It's essential to also consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance, so consulting a financial advisor would help tailor the distribution to your specific situation.
