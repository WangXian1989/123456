When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should take into account factors like your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer match in your 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Once you've maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable accounts:** If you have maxed out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. Keep in mind that capital gains are taxed differently than ordinary income, which can impact your overall tax strategy.

4. **Balance your investment strategy:** Diversify your investments across all accountsâ€”consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments that generate dividends or capital gains.

5. **Think about withdrawals:** Consider your anticipated withdrawal strategy during retirement. Tax-advantaged accounts typically have rules and penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts allow for more flexibility.

It's also advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that best fits your individual circumstances.

#### Investment Distribution Example:

- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match, then further contribute up to the annual limit if your budget allows.
  
- **IRA:** After maximizing your employer match, contribute to an IRA up to its annual limit.

- **Taxable Account:** Allocate any additional funds towards a taxable investment account where you can manage risk, diversification, and capital gains tax implications.

Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals.
