I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health and treatment options. The treatment for liver problems can depend on the specific condition or disease affecting your liver. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy body weight. Avoiding alcohol and limiting the intake of fatty and sugary foods can also help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed. For instance, antiviral medications can be used for hepatitis, while medications to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms may be prescribed for other liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular visits to a healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or significant liver damage, surgery may be needed. This could include a liver transplant.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore complementary approaches such as herbal remedies, but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider to ensure they're safe and effective.

It's important that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
