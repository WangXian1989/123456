Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA (up to $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts should be considered for investment after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, especially if you need liquidity or are in a lower tax bracket.
   - Think about tax-efficient investments for your taxable account, such as index funds or tax-exempt municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re saving for retirement that’s several years away, focus on aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts. If you have short-term goals, consider a taxable account for more liquidity.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

Combining these strategies should help optimize your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Also, consulting with a financial advisor is always a good idea for personalized guidance.

Remember to keep your overall financial goals in mind and adjust your contributions and investments according to changes in your income, expenses, or financial objectives.
