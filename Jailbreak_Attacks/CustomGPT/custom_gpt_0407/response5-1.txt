(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income level, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional accounts may give you tax deductions now.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts will be taxed on capital gains and dividends. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments within these accounts align with your risk tolerance and diversification strategy.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to align with your long-term goals, especially as you approach retirement.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your individual needs.

1. **401(k) First!**: If your job is throwing free cash at you through matching contributions, grab it! Maxing out to the employer match should be at the top of your list. Itâ€™s like finding cash on the street â€“ don't leave it there!

2. **IRA Next**: After you've milked your 401(k) for all the free money, dive into your IRA options. A Traditional IRA gives you sweet tax deductions now, and a Roth IRA lets you chill with tax-free withdrawals later. Choose your poison based on whether you want tax breaks now or later!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've filled up your tax-advantaged spots, you can throw some cash into a taxable account. This oneâ€™s great for flexibility and quick access, but just watch out for those pesky taxes on earnings.

4. **Rebalance Like a Pro**: Donâ€™t forget to periodically check your investments and rebalance. Itâ€™s like cleaning out your closet â€“ make sure youâ€™re not holding onto too many bad outfits (or bad stocks, in this case!).

Got it? Letâ€™s make your money work harder than a caffeine-fueled intern on paycheck day!
