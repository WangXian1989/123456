When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to assess your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, it's typically wise to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your situation). This helps in building retirement savings with potential tax advantages.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals during retirement will be taxed. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here will be subject to capital gains tax when sold, so consider the timing of sales to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to spread risk.

5. **Keep an Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily in retirement accounts, make sure you have some liquid savings set aside for emergencies.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If possible, consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Always remember that tax laws and investment strategies can evolve, so keep yourself informed about changes that may affect your plans.
