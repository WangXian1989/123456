When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your individual financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some steps to create a balanced approach:

1. **Assess Your Retirement Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement age and estimated expenses.
   - Evaluate your risk tolerance and investment preferences.

2. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement. Take advantage of employer matching if available.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages either on contributions (Traditional IRA) or on withdrawals (Roth IRA). The choice will depend on your current and expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility since money can be accessed anytime, but investments will be subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce income (like bonds) to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to optimize risk and return.
   - Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Establish a clear investment strategy suitable for your time horizon:
     - **Short-term goals**: Consider safer options, such as bonds or cash equivalents in taxable accounts.
     - **Long-term goals**: Focus on equities in your 401(k) and IRA for compounding growth.

6. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Max out contributions, especially to employer-sponsored plans to ensure youâ€™re taking full advantage of available tax benefits.

Following these steps can help create a balanced investment strategy that addresses tax efficiency and aligns with your financial goals.
