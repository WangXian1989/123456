The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA, in particular, offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it a great option if you qualify based on income limits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have capacity after maxing out your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit. This could be beneficial for high-income earners due to potential tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've fully funded your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This could be good for more flexible money access and potentially lower capital gains taxes on long-term investments.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your investment holdings (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep an eye on the tax implications of your investments, particularly in taxable accounts where you'll be subject to capital gains taxes.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your investment strategy and asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
