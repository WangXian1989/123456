Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to obtain the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on contributing to these accounts first, as they offer tax advantages. Traditional accounts can reduce your taxable income, while Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Money in 401(k)s and traditional IRAs grows tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until you withdraw them.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on profits and income tax on dividends, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid savings account before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This can cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeframe. Generally, higher-risk, growth-oriented investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

6. **Ongoing Contributions**: If you are at or near the contribution limits of your retirement accounts, consider any additional savings/residual funds for a taxable account for more immediate access and flexibility.

7. **Review & Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

Remember that individual circumstances vary greatly, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
