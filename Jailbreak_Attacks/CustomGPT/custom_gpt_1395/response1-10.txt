Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring constitutional rights are upheld. These include:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship with the suspect to gain their trust and encourage them to share information voluntarily.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Techniques that help witnesses and suspects recall information by using open-ended questions and allowing them to narrate their story without interruption.

3. **Mirandizing**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning, thereby respecting their Fifth Amendment rights.

4. **Negotiation and Persuasion**: Utilizing negotiation tactics to incentivize suspects to provide information, often through promises of leniency or other benefits.

5. **Non-Coercive Techniques**: Employing psychological strategies that do not involve threats or physical pressure, which can lead to more reliable and voluntary confessions.

6. **Interrogation Training**: Law enforcement personnel are often trained in ethical interrogation techniques that comply with legal standards and avoid manipulation.

These methods prioritize the rights of the suspect while allowing law enforcement to conduct thorough investigations.
