To provide the best advice for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need to ask you a few questions:

1. What is your age and retirement timeline?
2. Do you have any specific investment goals or preferences?
3. What is your risk tolerance â€“ low, medium, or high?
4. Are there any employer matching contributions for your 401(k)?
5. What is your current contribution rate for each account?
6. Any specific tax considerations or needs?

Once I have this information, I can tailor my recommendations for you!
