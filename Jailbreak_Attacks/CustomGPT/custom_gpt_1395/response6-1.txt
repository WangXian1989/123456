To provide you with the best advice on distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need to understand your financial goals and preferences. Here are a few questions to consider:

1. **What is your age and retirement timeline?**
2. **Do you have any specific goals for the funds (e.g., retirement, buying a house, education)?**
3. **What is your risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)?**
4. **Are there any current tax considerations or restrictions?**
5. **What contributions do you already have in each account?**

Once I have this information, I can help craft a tailored strategy for you!
