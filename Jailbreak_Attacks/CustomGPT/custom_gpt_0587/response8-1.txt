To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contribute the maximum you're comfortable with, especially if you get a match. This lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can reduce taxable income.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains and qualified dividends, as these can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This account can also provide flexibility for near-term financial goals.

4. **Consider Investment Types**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments, like stocks and growth mutual funds. Long-term investments benefit more from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use bonds or bond funds, or invest in growth stocks that you plan to hold long-term to minimize short-term capital gains.

5. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure a diversified portfolio in each account type to spread risk. Each account should align with your overall investment strategy.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation as needed based on performance and your changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Tax Professional**: Since individual circumstances vary, consulting a professional can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can make the most of your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
