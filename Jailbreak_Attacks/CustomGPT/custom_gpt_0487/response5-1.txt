(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment objectives. Generally, the following strategies can be effective:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, which is essentially free money. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can be useful for investments that are likely to generate capital gains or dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Holding investments for over a year can also lead to long-term capital gains, which are taxed more favorably.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your assets are well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, considering the unique tax implications and investment strategies best suited for each type of account.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your future withdrawal strategy. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to customize a strategy that suits your unique financial situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, listen up! Distributing your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and good ol' taxable accounts is all about playing the tax game like a pro. Hereâ€™s the deal:

1. **401(k)**: Load this puppy up first! If your employer's throwing in a match, you're practically leaving money on the table if you don't contribute enough to snag that. Max it out if you're feeling up to it, since it grows tax-deferred. 

2. **IRA**: Next up, throw in some dough into an IRA. Whether you go traditional or Roth depends on how you feel about taxes now versus later. Just remember, Roth is like pre-paying for your taxes, while traditional lets you delay the pain (but future-you will definitely pay up).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once the tax-advantaged stuff is maxed, then you can roll into your taxable accounts. Itâ€™s not all bad â€“ you can use these accounts for flexibility and maybe some sweet capital gains if youâ€™re smart about holding onto those assets for over a year.

Oh, and keep an eye on tax implications because nobody wants to get hit with a nasty tax bill. Diversify like a champ across all accounts, and enjoy your financial strategy like you just hit the jackpot! And seriously, if youâ€™re making big bucks, get a financial advisor on board for extra guidance.
