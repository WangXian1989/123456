Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### **1. 401(k) Accounts**
- **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.

### **2. IRA Accounts**
- **Types of IRAs**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions and taxable withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (taxed contributions and tax-free withdrawals).
- **Long-Term Growth**: Use IRAs for investments that you plan to hold long-term, benefiting from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

### **3. Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Great for short-term goals or unexpected expenses.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### **4. Suggested Distribution Strategy**
- **Start with 401(k)**: Max out employer match, then contribute to IRAs for tax benefits. 
- **Fill Up IRAs**: If eligible, utilize both Traditional and Roth IRA options based on your tax situation.
- **Finish with Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on investments suitable for short-term and long-term gains.

### **5. Rebalance and Review**
- Regularly review your allocation and make adjustments based on your financial goals, market conditions, and life changes.

### **Consult a Professional**
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation and ensure you're making the most of tax advantages.

### **Final Note**
- Diversification across your accounts can help mitigate risks and optimize growth. Balance is key!
