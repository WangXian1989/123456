When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After securing the employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
     - **401(k)**: If you're under 50, the contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500; if you're 50 or older, it's $30,000.
     - **IRA**: For traditional or Roth IRAs, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k), traditional IRA): Money grows tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts** (Roth IRA): Contributions are made with post-tax money, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed as capital gains, either short-term or long-term, depending on how long the investments are held.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors can generally afford a more aggressive approach since they have time to recover from market fluctuations.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments within each account type to manage risk.

5. **Accessibility Needs**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, while funds in retirement accounts often have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawal. Consider your liquidity needs when allocating funds.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your retirement goals, market conditions, and life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio that suits your retirement planning needs.
