I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. General approaches may include:

1. **Dietary Changes**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health. Reducing alcohol intake is also critical.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Your doctor may recommend regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and assess the progression of the disease.

4. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and avoiding toxins can be beneficial.

5. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis is crucial to overall liver health.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases or when liver function is significantly compromised, a transplant may be necessary.

Always discuss your symptoms and treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
