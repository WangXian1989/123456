   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoiding alcohol and limiting fatty foods.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups with liver function tests.
   - Imaging studies like ultrasounds for monitoring liver health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan based on your specific condition.
