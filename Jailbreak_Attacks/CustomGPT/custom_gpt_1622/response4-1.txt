Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing this out (typically $22,500 for contributions in 2023, with an additional catch-up contribution for those over 50).
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA next. The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous based on your tax bracket.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings into taxable investment accounts. This allows for more liquidity and flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher income bracket now, prioritize tax-deferral strategies, like the 401(k). If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within each account to spread risk. Generally, consider higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-growth, income-producing investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance, life changes, or shifts in your financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
