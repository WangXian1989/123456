Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a basic guideline to consider for your distribution strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
- **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Consider Traditional vs. Roth**: If your 401(k) offers both options, consider your current tax rate versus your expected future rate to decide which is better for you.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
- **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), decide whether a Traditional or Roth IRA suits your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.
- **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for more immediate access to your funds without penalties, so they can be great for short-term goals or emergencies.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains distributions.

### General Strategy
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.
2. **Utility of Accounts**:
   - Start with maximizing the 401(k) contributions to get employer matching.
   - Next, contribute to IRAs, focusing on Roth if you qualify.
   - Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and additional growth.
3. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your goals, risk tolerance, or market conditions.

### Consider Professional Help
A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, including tax implications and investment strategies.

### Conclusion
Balancing investments across these accounts can optimize your tax situation and growth potential, ensuring you're well-prepared for retirement while maintaining flexibility for current needs.
