Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which means your taxable income is reduced.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but you can access your money anytime. Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals:**
   - Short-term vs. long-term: If you need money in the short-term, consider keeping more in taxable accounts.
   - Retirement timing: If retirement is decades away, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you can—prioritize Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. A common approach is a balanced allocation across stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Review & Adjust:**
   - Monitor your allocations and rebalance as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 30% of total investment, focus on maxing out contributions and getting employer match.
- **IRA:** 30% with flexibility to choose between Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 40% for liquidity and flexibility, held in diversified, tax-efficient investments.
