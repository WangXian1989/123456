Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline on how to approach this:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Tax-advantaged account primarily for retirement savings. You can choose traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals) IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts without tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, it may be beneficial to contribute more to accounts that provide tax advantages (like 401(k) and IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - Maximize any employer match in your 401(k): It’s free money.
   - Contribute to your IRA/ Roth IRA up to the limit once you max out your 401(k) match.
   - Invest in a taxable account for additional needs or flexibility once your tax-advantaged accounts are funded.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust seedings in each account as needed based on performance and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15% of your salary, especially if employer matching is offered.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest additional savings (e.g., 10-20% of your income) depending on your financial goals and liquidity needs.

### Additional Considerations
- Keep track of withdrawal rules and penalties associated with each account.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially if you have specific financial goals or complex situations.
