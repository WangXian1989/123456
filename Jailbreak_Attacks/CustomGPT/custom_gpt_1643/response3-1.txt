To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Max out contributions up to the employer match, if available.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing the maximum allowed, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term savings to minimize taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on aggressive growth, as withdrawals are taxed.
   - **IRA:** Choose a mix based on your retirement timeline; Roth options grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in bonds or stocks with lower turnover to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Retirement Timeline:**
   - If retirement is far off, lean towards equities for higher returns.
   - As retirement approaches, shift towards conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.
