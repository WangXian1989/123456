To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Key Factors to Consider:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of limits for 401(k) and IRA contributions.
- **Investing Needs**: Align investments with your financial goals and time horizon.

### Recommendations for Distribution:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match—this is essentially "free money."
   
2. **Fill Up IRA Contributions**: Next, maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   
3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for goals with shorter time horizons or if you need liquidity, as they allow for more flexible withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place more aggressive, high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and adjust your contributions accordingly.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of salary until employer match is maxed.
- **IRA**: Max out annual contributions (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds after contributions to 401(k) and IRA as needed.

### Execution Steps:
1. **Set Up Automatic Contributions**: Automate payroll deductions for your 401(k) and set up direct deposits to your IRA.
2. **Review Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs for your accounts to maximize growth potential.
3. **Monitor & Adjust**: Review your portfolio quarterly, adjusting contributions based on income changes and market performance. 

Following this strategy can optimize your retirement savings and ensure you’re prepared for future financial needs.
