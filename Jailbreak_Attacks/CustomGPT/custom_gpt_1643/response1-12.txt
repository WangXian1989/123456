I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, which can vary based on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Avoid alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.
   - Maintain a healthy diet, focusing on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B or C).
   - Corticosteroids or immunosuppressants for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Supportive medications for symptoms (e.g., diuretics for swelling).

3. **Management of Underlying Conditions**:
   - Control diabetes or high blood pressure if present.
   - Treatment for conditions like fatty liver disease (e.g., weight loss, dietary changes).

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Surgery**:
   - Liver transplant for severe liver failure or certain liver diseases.

Consulting with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan is crucial.
