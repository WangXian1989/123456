Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

### 1. Prioritize Your Accounts
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if financially feasible.
  
- **Contribute to an IRA**: After the 401(k), contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax bracket and retirement goals). Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deferral.

- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments after maxing out retirement accounts. This is especially true if you plan to access funds before retirement age.

### 2. Tax Considerations
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred, allowing your investments to compound without immediate tax implications.
  
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here may incur capital gains taxes upon selling. Consider holding long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts. 
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk/return profile.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
- Personal circumstances vary widely. A financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.

By strategically allocating your contributions across these accounts, you can optimize growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
