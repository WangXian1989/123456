Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll pay taxes on earnings and capital gains, but you have more flexibility in withdrawals and investments.

### 3. **Target Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Specific Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on long-term growth investments here since you won’t need to access these funds for many years.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for shorter-term goals or if you want to have more flexibility in accessing your money without penalties.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance**
   - Match your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account according to your risk tolerance. Higher risk (stocks) could be allocated to accounts intended for long-term growth.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjust**
   - Revisit your allocation periodically and adjust based on changing circumstances, market performance, and age.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (up to match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible (e.g., $6,500 per year for 2023)
- **Taxable Account:** Any remaining income after 401(k) and IRA contributions

### Execution Steps:
1. **Set up automatic contributions** to your 401(k) and IRA.
2. **Open a taxable brokerage account** to streamline additional investments.
3. **Regularly monitor your investments** and adjust allocations based on performance and your evolving financial situation.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach considering tax implications, employer benefits, and personal financial goals will yield the best results. Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
