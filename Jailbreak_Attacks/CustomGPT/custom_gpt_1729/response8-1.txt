Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

2. **Fund an IRA**:
   - If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50+). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs give you upfront tax deductions.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. These accounts are great for short-term goals due to their liquidity, but keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each type of account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified distributions from Roth accounts are tax-free.

6. **Adjust for Your Goals**:
   - Tailor your allocation based on your retirement plans, expected income needs, and the time until retirement.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
