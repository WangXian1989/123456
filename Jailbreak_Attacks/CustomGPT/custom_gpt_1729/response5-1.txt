(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on maxing out your contributions if your finances allow.

2. **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your current and future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that might produce taxable income or for savings goals that are shorter-term. This can also be a good place for investments that benefit from favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, here’s the deal. First off, crush that 401(k)! Get those employer matches like they’re going out of style. That’s basically free cash thrown at you. Once you've snagged that, if you're young and hip (or just savvy), look at a Roth IRA—tax-free money in your hands later? Yes, please!

Now, taxables are your wild card. Use them for anything that doesn't fit in the other buckets. Think of them as your “fun” account or your stash for a new ride or whatever floats your boat. Just remember to keep an eye on those taxes—nobody wants Uncle Sam crashing the party! For the nitty-gritty, get yourself a financial guru to whip up a game plan that's as unique as your financial vibes.
