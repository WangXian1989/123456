To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income now, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Consider placing assets with high growth potential (but not yielding high income) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is appropriate for each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust contributions as needed.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, so ensure you have sufficient funds available for short-term needs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and retirement goals.

By strategically distributing your investments while understanding the tax implications, you can optimize your overall financial growth.
