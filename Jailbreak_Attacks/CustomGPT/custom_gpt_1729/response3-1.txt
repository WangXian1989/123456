The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax (for traditional) or after-tax (for Roth), which can help reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Traditional or Roth**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA might be preferable. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, consider a Roth IRA, where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If you can, aim to max out contributions to your IRA after making sufficient contributions to your 401(k) to get the match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investing Beyond Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional savings into a taxable account.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that are tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Guidelines**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Review Diversification**: Keep track of your asset allocation across accounts to ensure you’re not over-allocating to certain types of investments.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Each financial situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that best fits your needs.
