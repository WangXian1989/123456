When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if it's a traditional 401(k) to defer taxes.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Look for low-cost index funds or target-date funds for diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Maintain sufficient cash in your taxable account for short-term needs or emergency expenses. This helps avoid penalties from early withdrawal in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Long-Term Strategy**
   - Continuously reassess your investment mix and contributions. Adjust based on market changes, your financial goals, and life stages.

### 5. **Estate Planning Considerations**
   - Think about the tax implications for heirs, as IRAs and 401(k)s have specific rules about distributions compared to taxable accounts.

By applying these strategies, you can optimize your portfolio for growth, minimize taxes, and provide for future liquidity.
