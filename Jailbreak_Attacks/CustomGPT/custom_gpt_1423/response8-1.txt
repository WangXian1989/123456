Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maxing out employer matching, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, lean more towards Roth accounts. If you think your tax bracket will be lower, Traditional accounts might be more beneficial.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term or for investments that benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates, such as long-term investments.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure that your investments are well-diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your distribution annually or after major life events to reflect changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
