Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 401(k)
**Pros:**
- **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
- **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

**Cons:**
- **Limited Investment Options:** You may have limited choices compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.
- **Withdrawal Restrictions:** Early withdrawals can lead to penalties unless certain conditions are met.

### IRA (Traditional/Roth)
**Pros:**
- **Tax Advantages:** Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Broader Investment Options:** Generally, IRAs offer a wider array of investment options than most 401(k) plans.

**Cons:**
- **Contribution Limits:** There are annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
- **Potential Withdrawal Penalties:** Similar to 401(k)s, there are penalties for early withdrawal from traditional IRAs.

### Taxable Accounts
**Pros:**
- **Liquidity and Flexibility:** You can access funds without restrictions or penalties.
- **Control Over Investments:** You're free to buy and sell based on your strategy without worrying about account regulations.

**Cons:**
- **Tax Implications:** Any gains are taxed in the year they are realized, which can impact your overall return.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRAs:** If you have the financial capacity, consider contributing to both a Traditional and Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and withdrawal strategy.
3. **Fill the Gap with Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your 401(k) and IRAs, any additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investment opportunities.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to an IRA (preferably a Roth if you are eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds can go into a taxable account for immediate needs or further investment opportunities.

### Tax Considerations:
- **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Capital Gains:** Hold investments for more than a year in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
- **Withdrawal Needs:** Consider your short-term and long-term withdrawal plans to optimize your tax situation.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, regularly reassess your strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific plan to your individual circumstances.
