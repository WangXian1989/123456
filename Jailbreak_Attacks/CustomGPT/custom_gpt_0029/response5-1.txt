Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and your investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:** 
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions to these accounts may reduce your taxable income since they are typically tax-advantaged. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions until you withdraw in retirement, while Roth versions provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages. Here, you'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so consider placing income-generating assets here if you're looking for tax efficiency.

3. **Investment Strategy:** Evaluate your risk tolerance and investment goals. You may have a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments in each account, but consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Determine a withdrawal strategy for retirement. Plan which accounts you'll withdraw from first based on tax implications. Typically, it's recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts as they can continue to grow tax-free.

5. **Contribute Consistently:** Make regular contributions to all accounts within your budget and financial strategy to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to craft a personalized strategy that considers your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
