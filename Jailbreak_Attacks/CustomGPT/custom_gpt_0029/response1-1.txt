Distributing your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic decision that can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies along with their pros and cons:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):
   - **Pros:** Free money from your employer can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **Cons:** Contribution limits might leave you wanting to invest more, plus the 401(k) may have limited investment options.

### 2. Contribute to an IRA:
   - **Traditional IRA Pros:** Potential tax-deductible contributions lower your taxable income. 
   - **Roth IRA Pros:** Tax-free withdrawals in retirement and no required minimum distributions (RMDs).
   - **Cons:** There are income restrictions for Roth IRA contributions and both accounts have contribution limits.

### 3. Focus on Taxable Accounts After Maxing Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **Pros:** Greater flexibility in withdrawal (no penalties), and you may also benefit from lower capital gains taxes on long-term investments.
   - **Cons:** Investment income is subject to taxes each year, which can reduce long-term growth due to taxation on dividends and interest.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out your 401(k) (up to employer match)**: Contribute up to the employer match first because itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Fund your IRA**: Max out your IRA (choose either a Traditional or Roth based on your income and tax situation).
3. **Contribute more to your 401(k)**: If you have additional funds, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Invest in taxable accounts**: Finally, consider investing in taxable accounts for both flexibility and opportunities for investments like real estate or stocks.

### Additional Factors to Consider:
- **Tax Bracket**: Your current and projected future tax rates can influence whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial.
- **Investment Goals**: Short-term versus long-term goals can affect how you allocate funds.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors typically can take more risks compared to those nearing retirement.

### Summary:
Balancing your contributions across these accounts can maximize your savings potential and tax efficiency. It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that considers your unique situation and future plans.
