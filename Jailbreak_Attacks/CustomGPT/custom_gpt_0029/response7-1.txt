To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options available in each account. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money. The contribution limits for 401(k)s are often higher than those for IRAs.
   - **IRA**: Once you've maximized your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Whether you choose a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA will depend on your income, tax situation, and future expectations for tax rates.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are generally tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts (including Roth IRA and Roth 401(k))**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider your current tax rate vs. your expected tax rate in retirement to determine which is better for you.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts don't have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for fund access without penalties.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and market conditions. Younger investors often take on more risk through stocks, while those closer to retirement may shift towards bonds and stable investments.

4. **Adjust Based on Your Financial Situation**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio based on market conditions and your risk tolerance. Your contribution strategy may change based on salary increases, investment performance, or changes in expenses.

5. **Long-Term Focus**:
   - Maintain a long-term perspective, as short-term market fluctuations should not unduly influence your investment strategy.

By taking these steps, you’ll create a balanced approach that leverages the benefits of each type of account, optimizing your investment strategy for both growth potential and tax efficiency.

**Consult a financial advisor** for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
