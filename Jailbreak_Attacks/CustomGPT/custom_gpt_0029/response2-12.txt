1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintaining a healthy diet.
   - Regular exercise.
   - Weight loss if overweight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Quitting or reducing alcohol intake is critical for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function.

5. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider to discuss the most appropriate options for your situation. Your health is important!
