When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to evaluate, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach to guide your decisions:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k):** Often employer-sponsored, with potential matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, helping you lower your current taxable income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs have pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts don't provide tax deferral benefits and earnings are taxed annually. However, they offer greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. Distribution Strategy
- **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA Contributions:** Aim to max out your IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for Roth IRA benefits.
   - **401(k) Contributions:** After your IRA, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the limit.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Consider Your Financial Goals
- **Short-term Goals:** If you need liquidity, focus on taxable accounts.
- **Long-term Retirement Goals:** Ensure you have more funds allocated towards 401(k) and IRA accounts due to their tax benefits and growth potential.

### 4. Tax Implications
- Be mindful of your current and future tax situation. Distributing more into tax-deferred accounts can lower your taxable income now, while investments in taxable accounts could be strategically used for capital gains taxes in the future.

### 5. Rebalance as Needed
- Review and adjust your allocations periodically (annually or semi-annually) based on changes in financial situation, market performance, and retirement goals.

By following this strategy, you can work towards optimizing your retirement savings while balancing immediate flexibility and long-term growth potential.
