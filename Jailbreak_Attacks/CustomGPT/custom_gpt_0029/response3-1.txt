Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of each option with pros and cons to guide you:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
**Pros:**
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
- **Employer Match:** Many employers match contributions up to a certain percentage, which is essentially free money.
- **Higher Contribution Limits:** Generally, you can contribute more to a 401(k) than to an IRA.

**Cons:**
- **Limited Investment Choices:** You may have fewer investment options compared to IRAs.
- **Withdrawal Restrictions:** There are penalties for early withdrawal (before age 59½), with some exceptions.

### 2. **Traditional IRAs**
**Pros:**
- **Tax Deductibility:** Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and filing status.
- **Wide Range of Investments:** IRAs typically offer more investment options compared to a 401(k).

**Cons:**
- **Contribution Limits:** Lower maximum contributions compared to 401(k)s.
- **Withdrawal Rules:** Like 401(k)s, early withdrawals can incur penalties.

### 3. **Roth IRAs**
**Pros:**
- **Tax-Free Growth:** Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
- **No Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):** You are not forced to withdraw money at a certain age.

**Cons:**
- **Income Limits:** Higher income earners may not be eligible to contribute directly.
- **No Immediate Tax Break:** Contributions do not reduce your taxable income in the year they are made.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
**Pros:**
- **Flexibility:** You can withdraw money without penalties, making it accessible for goals like buying a house or emergencies.
- **No Contribution Limits:** You can invest as much as you want.

**Cons:**
- **Tax on Gains:** Investment earnings (interest, dividends, capital gains) are taxable in the year received.
- **Less Protection from Taxes:** Compared to retirement accounts, there are no tax advantages.

### **Recommended Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's free money.
2. **Consider IRAs:** If eligible, open a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and future income expectations.
3. **Balance Contributions:** Once you've secured the match and contributed to your IRA, return to your 401(k) or consider taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and investment strategy.
4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals, as they provide easy access to funds.

### Conclusion
The best approach often involves a mix of all three types of accounts, optimizing for employer matches and tax implications. Additionally, it would be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique financial situation and goals.
