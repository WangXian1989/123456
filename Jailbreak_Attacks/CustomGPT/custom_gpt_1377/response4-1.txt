Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors: your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to help guide your allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. Consider maxing out contributions if possible, as this reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After utilizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. 

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts for investments that generate higher taxable income (e.g., bonds), as this delays taxes until withdrawal.
   - Place investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends) in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles suited to your risk tolerance and goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, start considering how you'll withdraw funds. Generally, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow for as long as possible.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your accounts as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.
