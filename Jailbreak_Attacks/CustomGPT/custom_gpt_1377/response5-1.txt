To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, as these accounts offer tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional flexibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions reduce taxable income now, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free, making it a valuable option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for more liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes, so be mindful of your investment choices and holding periods.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance. Higher-risk assets may be suitable in tax-advantaged accounts where long-term growth is prioritized.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified. Holding bonds or safer investments in taxable accounts can minimize tax liability from capital gains.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Strategy Adjustments**
   - **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds from each account type, keeping tax implications in mind.

### Final Thoughts
Every individual's financial situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific goals and needs.
