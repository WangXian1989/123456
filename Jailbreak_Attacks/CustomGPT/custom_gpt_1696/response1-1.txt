Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. This allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your taxes to be higher in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After hitting the match, continue adding to your 401(k), especially if it has low fees and good investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for money you'll need before retirement. These accounts can offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Different accounts may have different investment timelines and risk profiles.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of each account type. For instance, placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts may help minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
