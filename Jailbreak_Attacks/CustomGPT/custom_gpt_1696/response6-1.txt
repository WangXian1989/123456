To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matches if available. This can provide immediate returns on your investment.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider whether a Roth or traditional IRA fits your tax strategy better.

2. **Balance Tax Exposure**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds or higher-yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts to shield from taxes.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for flexibility and immediate access.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and goals, placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and increasing bond allocation in taxable accounts for stability.

5. **Review Periodically**:
   - Adjust your contributions and investment mix as your financial situation and goals evolve.

By strategically leveraging the benefits of each type of account, you can optimize your overall investment returns while managing tax implications effectively.
