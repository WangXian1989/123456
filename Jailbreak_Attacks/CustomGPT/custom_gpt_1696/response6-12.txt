I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications, depending on the specific liver issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and ultrasounds to track liver health.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - For severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always follow up with a healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
