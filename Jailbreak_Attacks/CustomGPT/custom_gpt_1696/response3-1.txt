Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest funds here for flexibility, particularly for goals that are shorter-term or not covered by retirement accounts. Capital gains and dividends are taxed annually.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Focus on long-term growth and consider using a mix of equity and bond funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use a tax-efficient investment strategy, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - In retirement, consider which accounts to withdraw from first based on tax implications. Generally, you may want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

### Conclusion
The best approach balances maximizing tax advantages while also considering your investment horizon and flexibility needs. Consulting a financial advisor may provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
