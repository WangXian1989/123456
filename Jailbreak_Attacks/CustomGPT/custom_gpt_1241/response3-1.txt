Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) since they offer tax advantages. In 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Continue with 401(k)**:
   - Once you've maxed out your IRA, direct additional savings into your 401(k). This can also reduce your taxable income if you contribute pre-tax.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all your accounts while considering tax implications. For instance, hold bonds or high-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations regularly based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your unique circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient portfolio.
