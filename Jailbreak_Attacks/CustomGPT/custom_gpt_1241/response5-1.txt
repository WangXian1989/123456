To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out your employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable limit if you can. 401(k) plans often have a variety of investment options, so choose a diversified mix that aligns with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, prioritize funding a Traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions on contributions. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals with shorter time horizons or if you exceed contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your circumstances.

This structured approach can help you balance growth and risk while taking advantage of tax efficiencies.
