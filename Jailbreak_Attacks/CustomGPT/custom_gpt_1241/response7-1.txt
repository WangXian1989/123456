Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if offered. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) after taking advantage of the match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. Here, consider:
   - **Tax-efficient investments**: Municipal bonds or index funds with low turnover can help minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Balance your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when funds will be withdrawn in retirement to optimize tax implications.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
