To best distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Tax Advantages
1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket now compared to retirement.

2. **Diversify Tax Treatment**:
   - Balance contributions between pre-tax (401(k) and traditional IRA) and after-tax (Roth IRA) accounts to manage your tax liability in retirement.

### Investment Strategy
1. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use your 401(k) for equities if youâ€™re younger and can afford risk; favor bonds as you approach retirement.
   - Allocate more volatile investments in tax-sheltered accounts, while holding lower-growth bonds in taxable accounts.

2. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering market performance.

### Withdrawal Strategy
1. **Tax-Efficient Withdrawals**:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first (to benefit from long-term capital gains) before tapping into tax-deferred accounts.

2. **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**:
   - Plan for RMDs starting at age 72 from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs to avoid penalties.

### Additional Tips
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help optimize your specific situation.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep abreast of tax laws to adapt your strategy as needed.

By strategically allocating your investments while considering taxation, you can enhance your retirement readiness and financial security.
