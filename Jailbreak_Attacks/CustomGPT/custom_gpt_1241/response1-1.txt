Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions but tax you on withdrawals.
   - Factor in your current vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separately accessible account.

4. **Debt Management**:
   - Pay off high-interest debts before heavily investing.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify within your accounts to manage risk. Consider stocks for growth in retirement accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains, or for liquidity needs.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust contributions and allocations based on market performance and your changing goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
