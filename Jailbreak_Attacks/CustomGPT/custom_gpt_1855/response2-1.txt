Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA is often tax-deductible, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** The limit is generally $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). 

### 3. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in a diversified portfolio, keeping an eye on capital gains tax. Consider tax-efficient funds, like index funds.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Keep a balanced approach across your accounts. For instance, you might want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - The right distribution can change based on your income, tax brackets, and investment performance. Review your allocations regularly and adjust as necessary.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It may be beneficial to seek professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

By implementing a strategy that focuses on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first, you can effectively grow your savings while minimizing tax liabilities.
