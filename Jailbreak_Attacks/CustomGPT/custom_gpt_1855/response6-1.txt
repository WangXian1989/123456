Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals with a shorter time horizon (like saving for a home or travel). They offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Location**: Hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Establish an Overall Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk.
   - **Revisit Contributions**: Regularly assess your investments and adjust allocations based on market changes or life events.

### 4. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can tailor a strategy to your individual needs, taking into account factors like risk tolerance and market conditions.

By strategically allocating funds, you can optimize growth and minimize tax liabilities over time.
