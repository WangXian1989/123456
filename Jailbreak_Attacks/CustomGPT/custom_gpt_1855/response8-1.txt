To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit after maximizing any match. If possible, consider a Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages can compound over time.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Generally, tax-efficient investments, such as index funds, are better held in taxable accounts.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Monitor your investments and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation and goals.
