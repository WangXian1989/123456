Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - Focus on maxing out contributions if possible, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. 
   - Consider the investment options and fees available.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Traditional IRAs offer upfront tax breaks; consider this if you are currently in a high tax bracket.
   - Aim to max out contributions if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term (like buying a house) since you can withdraw without penalties.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### General Strategies:
- **Diversification**: Balance your investments across accounts for risk management.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that suits your specific situation.
