Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Traditional contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth 401(k) contributions are taxed now but grow tax-free.
   - **IRAs**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Use them for short-term savings or investments with lower turnover to minimize taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investment types that are less tax-efficient, such as bonds, which generate interest taxable as ordinary income.

4. **Pay Attention to Withdrawal Strategies**: In retirement, strategically withdraw from accounts to minimize taxes and maximize income. This can involve taking from taxable accounts first and allowing tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Revisit your allocations periodically to align with your changing financial situation, goals, or market performance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
