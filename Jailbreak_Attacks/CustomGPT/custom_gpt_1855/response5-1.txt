The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. You'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals (if eligible).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold and may incur taxes on dividends. It's best to hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (if under 50) and $30,000 (if 50 and older); the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Aim for a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, but consider where to place certain investments based on the tax implications.
   - High-growth investments might be better suited for Roth IRAs or taxable accounts, while bonds might fit better in tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Establish an Emergency Fund**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses accessible in a savings account.

### Conclusion
It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation or market conditions change.
