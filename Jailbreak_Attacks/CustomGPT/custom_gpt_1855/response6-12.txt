I’m not a doctor, but I can provide general information about liver problems and their treatment options. However, it's imperative to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.

   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoiding alcohol and substances that can harm the liver.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:

   - Imaging tests like ultrasounds or MRIs to assess liver condition.

4. **Surgery or Other Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

For personalized advice, it’s best to consult a healthcare professional who can provide guidance based on your specific condition.
