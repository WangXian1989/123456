I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can provide a personalized treatment plan. Generally, the best options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can greatly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms and improve liver function.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver health and detect any changes early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Supportive Therapies**: Nutritional support and managing related health issues (like diabetes) can also be beneficial.

Always seek professional medical advice for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
