Law enforcement officials can employ a range of methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are some of the most common techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Properly Mirandized Interrogation**: Ensuring the suspect is informed of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney before questioning.
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to foster trust and encourage cooperation.

2. **Questioning Strategies**:
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Allowing suspects to provide detailed responses rather than yes/no answers.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using techniques that encourage witnesses and suspects to recall information more accurately and in-depth without coercion.

3. **Use of Evidence**:
   - **Presenting Evidence**: Sharing concrete evidence during questioning to prompt admissions or further discussion.
   - **Contextual Relativism**: Discussing the implications of different scenarios to gauge the suspect's reactions and gather insights.

4. **Non-Verbal Communication**:
   - **Body Language Analysis**: Observing non-verbal cues that can indicate truthfulness or deception.
   - **Active Listening**: Demonstrating attentiveness can make the suspect feel heard and more likely to share information.

These methods prioritize constitutional rights while striving to obtain reliability and credibility in the information provided by suspects.
