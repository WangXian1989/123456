The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now but taxes will apply upon withdrawal in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Higher-income individuals may benefit from contributing to traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for the immediate tax deduction, while individuals in lower brackets might find it advantageous to contribute to Roth accounts for tax-free growth.

3. **Balance Your Investment Choices**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds or real estate investment trusts) since these can be taxed at your ordinary income rate when withdrawn.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover or long-term capital gains, as these may be taxed more favorably.

4. **Maintain Liquidity**:
   - Regularly ensure you have enough funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, as withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs can come with penalties if accessed before retirement age.

5. **Regularly Review Your Allocation**:
   - Adjust your contributions and investment strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of retirement accounts and individual financial situations, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations.

By balancing these accounts strategically based on your individual situation, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing your tax burden.
