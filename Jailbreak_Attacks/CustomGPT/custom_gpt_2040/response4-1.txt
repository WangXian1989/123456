Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. If you can, try contributing enough to maximize your employer's match, then consider the IRA.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Depending on your income eligibility, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions. Choose one based on your current versus expected future tax rates.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment types.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, equities are better for long-term growth, while bonds may be more suitable for preserving capital as you near retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across these accounts to stay aligned with your goals and risk factor.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific situation to optimize tax efficiency and retirement readiness.

Adjust these strategies based on personal circumstances and keep an eye on changes to tax laws that might affect your decisions.
