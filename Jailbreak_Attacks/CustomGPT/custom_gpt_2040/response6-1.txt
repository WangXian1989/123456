**To provide you with the best distribution strategy for your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need to understand your financial goals and situation better. Could you please clarify:**

1. **What are your retirement goals (e.g., age of retirement, desired income)?**
2. **Are you currently maximizing employer contributions to your 401(k) or any tax advantages from your IRA?**
3. **What is your current tax bracket and how does it influence your investment decisions?**
4. **Do you have a preference for risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)?**
5. **Are there any specific timelines or liquidity needs for your investments?**

Answering these questions will help tailor a strategy that best suits your financial needs.
