The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money. Contribute up to the maximum limit if you can.

2. **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your income levels and tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use after youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer more flexibility in withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when allocating assets among these accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
