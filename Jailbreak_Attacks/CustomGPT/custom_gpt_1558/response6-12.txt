I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferons or direct-acting antivirals may be prescribed.
   - **Liver Supplements**: Such as milk thistle may support liver function.

Always consult a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
