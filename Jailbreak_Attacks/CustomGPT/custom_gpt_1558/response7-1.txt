The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k) plan, especially if there is a matching contribution. This allows for tax-deferred growth, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the earnings until withdrawal.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides current tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like growth stocks) or for purposes where you need flexibility. Taxable accounts do not offer the same tax advantages, but they provide liquidity and can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

**Recommendation Strategy**:
- Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions if possible.
- Allocate additional funds to taxable accounts to ensure liquidity and meet short-term needs.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your personal financial situation.
