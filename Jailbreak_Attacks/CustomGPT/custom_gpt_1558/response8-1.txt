It's generally advisable to prioritize contributions based on tax advantages and your specific financial situation. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement account contributions, allocate excess funds here for flexibility and immediate accessibility.

Always consider diversification and consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.
