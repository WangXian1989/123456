Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA to reduce your taxable income now.

### 2. **Balance Your Investments**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) to minimize tax impact. Consider holding bonds and other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a higher bracket later, prioritize Roth accounts.

### 4. **Think About Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how and when you'll access funds. Tax-advantaged accounts typically have penalties for early withdrawal, influencing your distribution strategy.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to 401(k) (up to the match) and IRAs for tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that can minimize tax implications.
- Adjust based on personal financial goals and expected future income.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your specific circumstances.
