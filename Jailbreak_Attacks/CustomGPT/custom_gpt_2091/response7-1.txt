Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally, these have fewer tax advantages but offer flexibility. Theyâ€™re good for short-term goals or investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - **Dividends and Capital Gains**: Be mindful of how gains and dividends are taxed in taxable accounts versus the tax-deferred growth in your 401(k) and IRA.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance; consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative options in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on gains.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

4. **Long-Term Views**:
   - **Retirement Horizon**: The longer your investment timeline, the more aggressive your allocation can be. Adjust your investments as you approach retirement.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and personal goals.

### Suggested Distribution Example:
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match, then contribute 10-15% of salary.
- **IRA**: Max out yearly contribution once 401(k) match is secured.
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate any additional savings here, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your strategy to fit your specific circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor to optimize your distribution further.
