Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after obtaining the full employer match. Contributions are often tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Next, focus on a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer more liquidity and flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (e.g., index funds, ETFs) are better suited for taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Higher tax-impact investments** (e.g., bonds) might be better placed in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Adjust According to Your Situation**: Regularly review your investment strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investment accounts effectively.
