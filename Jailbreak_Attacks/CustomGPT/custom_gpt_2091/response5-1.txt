Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These accounts allow your investments to grow without immediate tax implications, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Perfect for long-term growth, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or as a place to invest in strategies that may generate lower tax liabilities.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio in each account type. This could mean holding different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) according to your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Adjust for Withdrawal Timing**
   - Plan withdrawals based on account types—consider tapping into taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Everyone’s financial situation is unique. A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific needs.

### General Guidelines
- **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions up to the match, then max out your IRA.
- **Roth IRA**: Excellent for long-term growth; prioritize if you're in a lower tax bracket now.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for flexibility and short- to medium-term goals, but focus on tax-efficient investments.

By maintaining a balance in contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investments across these accounts.
