Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum limit, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, otherwise use a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice aligned with your specific circumstances.
