Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Hereâ€™s a fun breakdown:

### 1. **401(k) Contribution:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full match; it's free money!
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce taxable income now.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Diversification:** Consider a Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Aim to max out contributions, especially in a Roth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use for short-term needs or to fund goals like buying a home.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider holding ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust percentages based on your comfort with risk in each account.
- **Regular Rebalancing:** Keep your allocation aligned with your goals over time.
