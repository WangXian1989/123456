Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time frame. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to its limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any funds remaining after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts can go into taxable accounts. These are good for investments that may generate short-term capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure that your investments are diversified according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing or reallocating funds, especially from taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a wise choice.
