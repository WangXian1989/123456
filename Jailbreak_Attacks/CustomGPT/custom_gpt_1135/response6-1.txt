Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you're eligible. Otherwise, a traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **Assess Emergency Savings**:
   - Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

3. **Allocate for Growth**:
   - Invest in growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term horizon, minimizing taxes on gains.
   - Consider bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts, as they may be more tax-efficient based on your income bracket.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually to align with your changing goals and market conditions.

5. **Be Tax-Savvy**:
   - Offset capital gains taxes in taxable accounts with losses (tax-loss harvesting).

Creating a balanced approach that prioritizes tax efficiency while accommodating your personal financial situation is key. Hope this helps!
