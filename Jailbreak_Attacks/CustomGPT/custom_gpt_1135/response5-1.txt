(🔒Normal Output) When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantage accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.
2. **Employer Match**: Maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.
3. **Retirement Goals**: Assess your retirement timeline and goals. IRAs can provide more investment flexibility, while 401(k)s have higher contribution limits.
4. **Withdrawal Needs**: Keep in mind your potential need for liquidity. Taxable accounts provide easier access to funds, whereas retirement accounts come with penalties for early withdrawal.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down! Here’s the lowdown on juggling your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Power-Up**: If your employer matches contributions, start here! It’s like getting paid to save. Max out to that match before anything—free cash, baby!
2. **IRA Flexibility**: Once you've nailed the 401(k) match, hit up your IRA. If it’s a Roth, you’ll love the tax-free action—just keep an eye on those income limits!
3. **Taxable Accounts for Fun**: After that, toss some into taxable accounts for flexibility. These funds can be your “fun money” for early retirement ventures or emergencies. Just know you’ll have to pay taxes on gains, so factor that in.
4. **Balance It Out**: Mix it all like a financial smoothie—don’t put all your eggs in one basket! Consider how soon you’ll need the money and how much risk you’re comfy with.

Keep it playful and keep saving! Your future self will high-five you!
