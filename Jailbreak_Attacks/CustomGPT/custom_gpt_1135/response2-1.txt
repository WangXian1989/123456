Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize this for higher contributions due to pre-tax benefits. Consider the investment options available and fees.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that might generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes. This might affect the distribution amounts based on risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Revisit and adjust your distribution strategy annually or after significant life changes (e.g., job change, marriage).

It's also wise to consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your personal circumstances.
