Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket since this will reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After your 401(k), contribute to an IRA. Choose a **Traditional IRA** for upfront tax deductions or a **Roth IRA** for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts with funds that may have lower tax implications, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes. Utilize tax-loss harvesting when possible.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. 
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Keep funds in taxable accounts if you need liquidity.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes to reduce risk.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. For example, withdrawals from a Traditional IRA are taxed as income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially to capture employer matching.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit (consider a Roth for tax-free growth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest leftover savings focusing on low-tax impact investments.

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution based on your specific situation. Consulting a financial advisor can help align your strategy with your goals.
