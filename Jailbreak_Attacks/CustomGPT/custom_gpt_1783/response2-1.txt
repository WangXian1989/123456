To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit (or match) to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, you might hold higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains are sheltered from taxes.

5. **Periodic Reviews**: Regularly assess and adjust your distribution based on performance, changes in income, and retirement goals.

6. **Consider Fees and Efficiency**: Keep an eye on fee structures in each account type and aim for low-cost index funds when possible to maximize returns.

A balanced approach tailored to your financial situation will help optimize growth and minimize taxes over time.
