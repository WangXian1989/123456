To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible (traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings you may need access to before retirement. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax liability.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stocks can grow in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds may be better in taxable accounts to avoid high tax on interest.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains and dividends in taxable accounts. Place high-growth or high-income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique financial situation.
