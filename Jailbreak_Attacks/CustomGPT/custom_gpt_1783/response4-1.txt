To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to reach the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. The contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for savings goals that are under five years away or for flexibility. Focus on investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes (like index funds).

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Generally, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax exposure.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation annually to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.

By following these steps, you can optimize tax benefits while managing risk and liquidity effectively.
