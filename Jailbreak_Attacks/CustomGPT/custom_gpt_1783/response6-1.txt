To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is often considered "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Max out contributions to your IRA once your 401(k) is matched, as it offers tax advantages.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Roth IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, keeping in mind the tax implications.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Diversification:** Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account type.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how to draw funds from each account in retirement for tax efficiency.

### Conclusion:
Focus on maxing tax-advantaged accounts first, then leverage taxable accounts strategically to balance your overall tax exposure.
