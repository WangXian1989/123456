I'm not a doctor, but I can outline some common treatment options that may be considered for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver), antiviral medications or steroids may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like a liver biopsy may be necessary to assess the damage or condition.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe cases where the liver is failing, a transplant might be the only option.

Itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
