To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Roth or traditional) for additional tax benefits. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Funds in taxable accounts grow but are subject to capital gains and income taxes. Keep investments that produce high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding long-term growth investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all account types to mitigate risk. Each account can hold different assets based on your overall strategy.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Savings**: Keep enough liquid funds in your taxable account to cover emergencies or short-term goals, ensuring you donâ€™t have to tap into retirement accounts prematurely.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation is also a wise choice.
