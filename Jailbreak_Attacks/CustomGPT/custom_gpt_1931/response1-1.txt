To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match contributions first. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can provide a tax deduction now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable events, like stocks with high volatility or investments that pay dividends. Consider tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to minimize risk.

5. **Rebalance**: Periodically assess and rebalance your investment allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your unique situation would also be beneficial.
