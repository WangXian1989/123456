The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on which is more beneficial for your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: Once your IRA contributions are maximized, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limits.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, use an appropriate asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment timeline. Typically, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding less tax-efficient investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust as needed based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, or personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies suited to your unique situation.
