I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for your liver problem. Depending on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.), treatments may range from lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, to medications or even procedures. It's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action tailored to your individual needs.

For personalized advice, please reach out to your doctor or a specialist who can provide guidance based on your medical history and current condition.
