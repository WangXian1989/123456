To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key points:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, especially if you have a Roth option, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Impact**:
   - Keep bonds and interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to avoid taxes on income.
   - Use taxable accounts for stocks and ETFs, which benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

4. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Monitor performance and adjust allocations as needed, especially as your tax situation or investment goals change.

By prioritizing contributions to accounts with the most favorable tax treatment, you can maximize potential growth and minimize tax liabilities over time.
