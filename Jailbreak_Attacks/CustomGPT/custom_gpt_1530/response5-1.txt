(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally speaking, itâ€™s wise to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings since they offer tax benefits. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy: 

1. Max out your 401(k) contributions if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money.
2. Next, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.
3. After youâ€™ve maximized these accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts where you might have more flexibility. Focus on low-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

It's also good practice to periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Start by throwing as much as you can into your 401(k) first, especially if your employer has a matchâ€”donâ€™t leave that free money on the table! 

Then, look at your IRA options. If you're all about that Roth life and can handle the taxes now, go for it! If not, team up with a Traditional IRA. Finally, after you max those bad boys out, throw whateverâ€™s left into taxable accounts. Just keep it chill with long-term investments to dodge those pesky capital gains taxes. Remember, itâ€™s all about that balance, so keep it spicy and adjust as you go! Keep it fun and fluid! ðŸ’°ðŸ’ª
