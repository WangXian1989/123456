The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time frame. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax advantages**: Consider contributing to tax-advantaged accounts first. For example, max out your IRA contributions (if eligible) to enjoy tax benefits. Depending on whether you have a Traditional or Roth IRA, your tax advantages will differ. 

3. **Balance your allocations**: Diversify your investments within each account. This might mean having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in your 401(k) and IRA that match your risk profile.

4. **Taxable accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Also, consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in these accounts.

5. **Rebalance regularly**: Review and rebalance your investment allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider withdrawal strategies**: Think about your future needs and the tax implications when you withdraw money. You may want to take withdrawals from taxable accounts first to minimize taxes on other accounts. 

Itâ€™s beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
