The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to this account since withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial for long-term growth.

3. **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Use your 401(k) and traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement, as these accounts don't have withdrawal penalties and offer more flexibility.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. For instance, it's often beneficial to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and keep high-turnover investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified to manage risk.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your investment strategy as your financial situation or market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
