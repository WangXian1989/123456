To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  
### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Preferred Accounts First**: Generally, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts, since they offer tax benefits that can enhance growth.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation:
     - **If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement**, a Roth IRA may be advantageous.
     - **If you aim to lower your taxable income now**, a Traditional IRA could be more beneficial.

### 3. **Balance Based on Retirement Goals**
   - **Assess Future Needs**: Consider how much you need to save for retirement, then distribute contributions to reach that goal efficiently.
   - **Age Considerations**: Younger investors might lean more towards a higher percentage in growth-oriented investments (often in taxable accounts), whereas older investors might prefer more stable, income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments in each account with your risk tolerance. For example:
     - Aggressive growth stocks in a 401(k) for long-term growth.
     - Bonds or dividend stocks in an IRA for income.
     - A diversified mix in taxable accounts for flexibility.
  
### 5. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**
   - **Annual Review**: Regularly review asset allocation based on market conditions, life changes, and retirement goals to ensure your strategy remains effective.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach tailored to your individual circumstances, tax situation, and retirement goals will yield the best results. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance aligned with your specific financial situation.
