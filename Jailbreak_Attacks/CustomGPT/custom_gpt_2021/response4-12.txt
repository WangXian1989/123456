I'm not a doctor, but if you have concerns about your liver health, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems can include medication, lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and sometimes more serious interventions like surgery or liver transplant, depending on the specific condition. Always seek professional medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
