Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide additional tax advantages depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Generally, you should prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free under certain conditions. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on realized profits.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk effectively.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might prioritize growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement might focus on preserving capital. Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

7. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your distribution and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that considers your specific circumstances.
