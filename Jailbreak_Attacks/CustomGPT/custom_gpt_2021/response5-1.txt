(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a balanced approach involves prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA Accounts:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The choice between the two depends on your tax situation and future tax expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** If you still have funds to invest after your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider adding to taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts might be beneficial.

5. **Diversification of Investments:** Ensure that your investment allocation within each account reflects your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
