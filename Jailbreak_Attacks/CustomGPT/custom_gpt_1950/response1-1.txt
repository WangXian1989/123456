When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings over time.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 401(k)s, the limit is higher compared to IRAs. Make sure you're maximizing these limits where possible.

4. **Diversification**: Within these accounts, ensure you're diversifying your investments. This could mean a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Tax Implications**: Understand that taxable accounts might incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Consider where to hold different types of investments based on their tax implications.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Think about your long-term financial goals. If you anticipate needing funds soon, you might want to keep more money in taxable accounts. Conversely, if you're investing for retirement, lean more into your 401(k) and IRA.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: As time goes on, make sure to review and rebalance your investments periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

A good rule of thumb is to start with maximizing your 401(k) contributions, then fill your IRA, and use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, while always keeping your overall financial goals in mind. It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal situation.
