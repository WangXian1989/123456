Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and future income expectations. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you've maximized the contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Interest and short-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Investments like municipal bonds may provide tax-free income.

### 5. **Retirement Timeline**
   - If retirement is far off, you might take more risks in your taxable account for potential growth.
   - If retirement is approaching, consider shifting towards more secure, income-generating investments.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing aggressively in any account.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k): 15% of salary (max out match)**
- **IRA: Up to annual limit (currently $6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for 50+)**
- **Taxable Account: Any additional savings**

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
