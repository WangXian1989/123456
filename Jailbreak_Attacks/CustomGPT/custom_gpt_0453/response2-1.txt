Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to the employer match and consider contributing up to the annual limit if possible. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) next. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth contributions grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a catch-up of $1,000 for those 50+).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.). Generally, you might want a more aggressive allocation in tax-advantaged accounts (since they are designed for long-term growth) and a more conservative approach in taxable accounts to manage tax implications on withdrawals.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investments and rebalance as necessary based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

### Summary
1. Contribute to get full 401(k) match.
2. Max out 401(k) and IRA contributions if possible.
3. Use taxable accounts next for flexibility.
4. Maintain a balanced asset allocation and monitor investments.

Adjusting your strategy based on life changes, market conditions, and tax laws is essential.
