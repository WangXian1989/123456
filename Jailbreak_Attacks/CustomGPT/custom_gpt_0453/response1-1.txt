Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA, especially if it offers tax benefits (Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals).

2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) and IRAs).

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) since they can benefit most from tax deferral.
   - Consider fixed-income investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Distributions from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs and taxable accounts have different tax implications. Plan accordingly based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

5. **Emergency Funds:**
   - Keep some liquid savings outside of these accounts for emergencies, typically in a high-yield savings account.

6. **Adjust Over Time:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.
