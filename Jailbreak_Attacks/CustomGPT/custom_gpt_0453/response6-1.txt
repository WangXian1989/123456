Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Invest more in tax-advantaged accounts since growth in these accounts isn't taxed until withdrawal (Traditional) or may be tax-free (Roth).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for greater liquidity, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Within Accounts**
   - Maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to balance risk and return.

### 4. **Monitor Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate if held long-term.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**
   - Reevaluate your distribution strategy annually or after major life events (marriage, job change, etc.).

By tailoring your distribution strategy to these factors, you can maximize your investment growth while minimizing taxes.
