To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, focus on maxing out your IRA. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions available if you're over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any funds beyond the tax-advantaged accounts can go into taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals but have different tax implications.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments to manage risk and aim for a balanced portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.
