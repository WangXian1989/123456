To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contribution if possible (limit set by the IRS).
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages depending on your income and future tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends for better tax treatment.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Good for high-income earners who expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Diversify Investment Types:**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more liquid investments or alternative assets, keeping in mind tax implications for withdrawals.

4. **Strategic Withdrawals:**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on your tax situation in retirement to minimize taxes. Use taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your target asset allocation, taking care to consider tax implications when rebalancing taxable accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
