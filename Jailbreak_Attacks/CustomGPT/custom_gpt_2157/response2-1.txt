To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match firstâ€”it's free money. Aim to max out if possible, especially if you have a high income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (if eligible) or a traditional IRA for tax deductions. This can be a good option if you're in a lower tax bracket now compared to your retirement.

2. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Make sure to have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds that you may need in the short term and to invest in assets that benefit from long-term capital gains (e.g., stocks or ETFs).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds, which can minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments by spreading them across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target investment strategy, especially if market conditions change.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Focus on long-term growth, but be mindful of fees and tax implications associated with each account type.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By using a combination of these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments.
