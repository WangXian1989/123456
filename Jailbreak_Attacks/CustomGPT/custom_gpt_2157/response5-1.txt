(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. 

1. **Max out your 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
3. **Taxable accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest any additional funds in a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

Consider your overall asset allocation and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired investment balance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s get real about your money! The best way to manage your cash flow among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like a game of chessâ€”strategy is key.

1. **401(k) First:** Scoop up that employer match like it's the last piece of pizza. If theyâ€™re offering free cash, donâ€™t leave it on the table! Max it out if you can.
2. **IRA Time:** Then, dive into an IRA. A Roth is great if you think youâ€™ll be earning more down the line because you pay taxes now and enjoy that sweet tax-free growth later. Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income nowâ€”pick your poison!
3. **Taxable Accounts Last:** Anything extra goes into taxable accounts. Here, you can play the field with stocks, ETFs, or whatever floats your boatâ€”but be ready for those capital gains taxes!

Always keep an eye on your long-term goals and change your strategy if your financial game changes. Rebalance that portfolio like a boss!
