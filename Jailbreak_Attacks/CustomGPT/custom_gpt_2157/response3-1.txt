Distributing your money wisely across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax bracket, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) to minimize taxes. 
   - Consider keeping higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before maximizing contributions to avoid dipping into retirement accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Think about how withdrawing from different accounts will affect your taxes in retirement. Having a mix of account types can provide flexibility.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
