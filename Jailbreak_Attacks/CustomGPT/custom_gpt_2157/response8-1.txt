To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If possible, aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Balance Between Accounts**:
   - Aim to allocate more funds to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth, while keeping some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less tax liability (like index funds or ETFs) and hold more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Consider stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds for stability.
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation matches your investment goals, regardless of the account.

4. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to your accounts to stay consistent.
   - Annually review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about your strategy, a financial advisor can offer personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across these account types while maximizing tax efficiency and growth potential.
