To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize this first.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for shorter-term goals. This allows your tax-deferred accounts to grow without immediate tax implications.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to minimize risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals for retirement to minimize taxes; consider taking from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, then tax-free accounts last.
