To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which have lower tax rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Balance Growth and Risk**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for stable, income-generating investments.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

### Action Steps:
- **Set annual contribution goals** for each account type.
- **Diversify investments** across asset classes to mitigate risk.
- **Consult a financial advisor** for personalized strategies based on your situation.

By strategically distributing your money, you can maximize growth while minimizing taxes.
