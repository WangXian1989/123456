Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - Contribute to a **Traditional or Roth IRA**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider this option.
     - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, this can be advantageous for tax-free growth.
   
### 3. **401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing the IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your **401(k)**, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.

### 4. **Assess Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as:
     - **Long-term investments** (stocks or ETFs).
     - **Tax-efficient funds** or index funds that minimize capital gains distributions.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside of your investment accounts.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocation based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out your contribution (currently $6,500 per year for individuals under 50).
3. **401(k)**: Continue contributing until you hit the annual limit ($22,500 for individuals under 50).
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Pour additional savings into these accounts for short-term goals or additional retirement savings.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is tailored to your specific financial situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice considering your complete financial picture.
