Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs being tax-deferred and Roth IRAs allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Less tax-efficient for long-term growth but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Set Priorities:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Retirement Goals:** Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Account Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
     - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA.
     - If eligible, prioritize Roth contributions for tax-free growth.
   - **Balance Contributions:**
     - If you have extra funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, direct those funds into a taxable account.
   - **Consider Asset Location:**
     - Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxation.
     - Keep stocks in taxable accounts for long-term capital gains tax benefits.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Assess your current and projected tax rates when choosing between traditional and Roth accounts.
   - For taxable accounts, consider realizing gains and losses strategically to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reevaluate your allocation and strategy annually or whenever your financial situation changes (e.g., salary increases, major life events).

### Sample Distribution: 
- **Priority 1:** Max out employer match in 401(k) 
- **Priority 2:** Max out IRA contributions
- **Priority 3:** Additional savings in a taxable account

### Conclusion:
Tailor this approach based on your circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific financial situation.
