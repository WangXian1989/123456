Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment strategy. A balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can be beneficial.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place tax-efficient investments like index funds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - **Periodic Review**: Reevaluate your distribution strategy annually or after significant life changes (e.g., marriage, job change).
   - **Flexibility**: Stay adaptable to changing tax laws and market conditions. 

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - **Order of Withdrawals**: In retirement, consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type. Typically, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**:
   - **Separate Investments**: Keep short-term funds in liquid, accessible accounts, while funneling long-term funds into retirement accounts to benefit from compounding interest.

### Conclusion
It's often advantageous to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts to maximize growth and tax savings. Regular assessment and reallocation of assets according to your financial situation and market conditions are key to maintaining an effective distribution strategy. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a tailored approach based on your individual circumstances.
