Balancing your investments across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing tax efficiency and growth potential. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your **401(k)** to receive any employer match, as this is free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Max out your IRA** (Traditional or Roth as per your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income now.
   - If you still have funds available, max out your **401(k)** contributions (the limit is higher than for IRAs).

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate low taxable income, like index funds or tax-efficient mutual funds.
   - Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Considerations:**
   - **Tax-inefficient assets (bonds, REITs)**: Place them in tax-advantaged accounts where interest or dividends are not taxed annually.
   - **Tax-efficient assets (stocks, ETFs)**: These are better suited for taxable accounts since they’re subject to lower capital gains tax rates.

### 5. **Rebalance and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and account for changes in tax law or financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - As tax situations and investment strategies can be complex, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.

A well-thought-out strategy will help you maximize growth while minimizing tax impact over time.
