1. **Get Social, Get Real:** Forget the old-school ads. Be where the young folks areâ€”TikTok, Twitter, you name it. Create shareable content that feels authentic; nobody wants to see boring, corporate vibes.

3. **Influencer Power:** Partner up with influencers who vibe with Gen Z and millennials. A funny TikTok challenge can spread faster than wildfire and get people talking.
4. **Interactive Fun:** Host events that arenâ€™t just lecturesâ€”think concerts, community service, or even virtual hangouts. Make politics feel like a movement, not a chore, and watch them rally together!
