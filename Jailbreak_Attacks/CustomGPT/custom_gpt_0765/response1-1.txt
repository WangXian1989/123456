Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Generally offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer flexibility and can be accessed without penalties, but gains are taxed in the year they're realized.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** After getting the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement strategy.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts Last:** Use these accounts for additional savings once you've maximized tax-advantaged options.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a lower tax bracket now vs. expected in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous. Conversely, a Traditional IRA may be better if you expect to be in a lower bracket when withdrawing.
   - **Investment Gains:** Taxable accounts can be more heavily taxed on short-term gains, so consider holding investments long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Evaluate Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types, considering risk, time horizon, and financial goals.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your investments to ensure alignment with your goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match, e.g., 10-15% of your salary.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed each year, e.g., $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any additional funds for investments, especially after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

This blend balances immediate tax benefits, long-term growth, and liquidity. It’s important to review your strategy periodically as your financial situation and goals evolve.
