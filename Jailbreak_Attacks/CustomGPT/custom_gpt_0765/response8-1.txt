The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. IRAs often have more investment options than 401(k) plans.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Both 401(k) and Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth. Contributions can lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made after taxes, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments, but you have flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts where you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal. For taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that assets across all accounts are diversified to minimize risk and enhance potential returns.

6. **Reassessment**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation changes, market conditions evolve, and you approach retirement.

It’s often wise to consult a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific circumstances.
