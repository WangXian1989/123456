Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning they lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings (interest, dividends, capital gains) are taxed in the year they occur, typically at capital gains rates.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - Max out employer matching in your 401(k) first, as this is effectively "free money."
   - Consider maxing out Roth IRA contributions (if eligible) for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - After maximizing benefits from retirement accounts, focus on additional 401(k) or IRA contributions, then taxable accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - Consider holding lower-growth, income-producing investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Hold high-growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable capital gains tax rates.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Adjust contributions and reallocate investments as needed, considering each account's growth and tax implications.

### 5. **Consider Your Timeline and Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep in mind your retirement timeline. Funds in 401(k) and IRAs are generally better suited for long-term growth.
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a taxable account or easily accessible savings vehicle.

### 6. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation Yearly**
   - Tax laws change, as do your financial circumstances. Review your approach annually or when significant life changes occur (like a new job, marriage, etc.).

### Determining the Right Mix
- **Short-term Goals:** More funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Long-term Goals:** Aim for heavier contributions to tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth and tax benefits.

### Summary
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your unique financial situation and goals. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
