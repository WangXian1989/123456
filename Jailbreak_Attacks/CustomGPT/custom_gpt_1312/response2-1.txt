Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute the maximum to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax advantages.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you're close to the contribution limit.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Roth Accounts**: Consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Keep a balanced mix of equities and fixed income across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a cash reserve before heavily investing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider talking to a professional who can assess your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
