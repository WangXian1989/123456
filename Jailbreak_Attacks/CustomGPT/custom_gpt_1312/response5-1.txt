(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your age, financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Generally:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k), especially if they offer matching contributions. These grow tax-deferred, which is beneficial for long-term growth.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify, consider opening a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. Diversifying your retirement accounts can provide tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you may want to access before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! First off, maximizing your 401(k) is a no-brainer, especially if your employer matches contributions. Free money? Yes, please! Aim to hit that max contribution limit if you can.

Next up, the IRA game: both Roth and traditional IRAs have their perks. If you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later, go for a Roth. Tax-free withdrawals? Count me in! For the taxable accounts, think tactical with investments. Index funds and ETFs are your friends hereâ€”they're usually more tax-efficient. Just remember: the earlier you strategize, the better your nest egg will grow. Happy investing! ðŸ’¸
