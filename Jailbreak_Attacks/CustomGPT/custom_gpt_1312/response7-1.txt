To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This effectively gives you free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts can provide tax benefits that enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Pay Attention to Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2024, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $23,000 (plus $7,500 catch-up if you're 50 or older) and for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, but distributions will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k) in tax treatment.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll be taxed on dividends and capital gains, so consider holding more tax-efficient investments here (like index funds).

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before locking money away in long-term investments.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your savings across different accounts while minimizing your tax burden and maximizing growth potential.
