To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - This ensures you're taking full advantage of free money.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:**
     - Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first (consider both traditional and Roth IRAs based on your tax situation).
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use this for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as stocks or index funds.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance & Time Horizon:**
     - Allocate high-risk, growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Bonds & Income-Generating Investments:**
     - Consider placing these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower taxes on long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help you manage tax brackets and defer withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Final Tips:**
- **Review Regularly:** Adjust your allocations as needed based on your financial goals and changes in tax laws.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Professional guidance can help tailor your strategy to specific tax implications and personal goals.

This balanced approach allows you to optimize both growth and tax efficiency through your investment vehicles.
