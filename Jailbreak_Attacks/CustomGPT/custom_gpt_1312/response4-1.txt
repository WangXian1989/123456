Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for tax deferral. Consider traditional vs. Roth options based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This could be useful for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Different types of accounts can hold different types of investments:
   - **401(k)**: Higher growth assets (e.g., stocks) can be suitable since taxes are deferred.
   - **IRA**: A mix of growth and income-generating assets can work, considering your retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Calculate Tax Impact**: Be mindful of how withdrawals from these accounts will impact your tax situation in retirement, particularly with required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.

By following this structured approach, you can optimize your savings across different types of accounts while planning for a secure retirement.
