Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this is beneficial.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deduction benefits; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you prefer tax breaks now or later.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate funds across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to balance risk and reward.
   - Utilize your 401(k) for tax-advantaged growth, and consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are less tax-efficient, like stocks for long-term gains or municipal bonds. This account can also hold short-term investments.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on market performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: In retirement, strategize from which accounts to withdraw first based on tax implications.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
