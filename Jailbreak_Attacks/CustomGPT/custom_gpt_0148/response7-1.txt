To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. With a Traditional IRA, consider your tax bracket since contributions are often tax-deductible.

2. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes, potentially pulling from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts as needed.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized guidance based on your financial goals and tax situation.

### Summary:
1. Maximize 401(k) contributions (especially for employer match).
2. Fund IRAs (Roth if eligible).
3. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.
4. Rebalance your portfolio.
5. Get professional advice if needed.

This strategy helps optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
