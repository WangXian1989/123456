Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth potential, tax implications, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) (Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plan)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually a good return on investment).
   - **Investment Options**: Typically offers a selection of mutual funds or other investments. Aim for a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Eligibility**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals or a Traditional IRA for upfront tax deductions.
   - **Contribution Limit**: Stay within annual contribution limits ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for 50+ in 2023).
   - **Investment Strategy**: Choose investments with growth potential, such as stocks or ETFs, as these can benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: Use for savings goals outside retirement (e.g., home purchase, emergencies).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds). Be mindful of capital gains taxes on sales.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks, which may be more tax-efficient in these accounts.

### **General Tips**
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations based on market performance and life changes.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: Hold income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings for immediate needs before heavily investing.

### **Consult a Professional**
Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your individual situation and goals.
