To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match and consider increasing contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Use these for liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth assets (stocks) due to deferred taxes.
   - **IRA**: Depending on tax brackets, choose between Roth (tax-free growth) or Traditional (tax-deferred growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals based on your retirement timeline:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
   - Consider tax implications for Traditional IRA withdrawals versus Roth.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and rebalance your portfolio annually to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance.
