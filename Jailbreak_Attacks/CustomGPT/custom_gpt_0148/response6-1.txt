To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially for Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency in Investment Choices**
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - **Hold Tax-Efficient Investments**: Opt for index funds or ETFs with minimal turnover, which incur fewer capital gains taxes.
     - **Utilize Tax Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains with losses to reduce your taxable income.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
     - **Higher Growth Assets**: Place assets that are expected to grow significantly here, as they won't be taxed until withdrawal.

### 3. **Balance and Rebalance**
   - **Regularly Review Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline, adjusting as necessary.

### Conclusion
Strategic allocation can enhance returns while minimizing tax implications, ensuring long-term growth.
