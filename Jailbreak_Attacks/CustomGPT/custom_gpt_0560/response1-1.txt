Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. 

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you expect a lower tax bracket, a traditional IRA may be better.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out your IRA contributions if possible since these accounts offer tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Use these for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have access to liquid funds outside of retirement accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.

In summary, prioritize employer matches and tax advantages while considering your financial goals and tax implications.
