(üîíNormal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is effectively free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be advantageous for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for assets that generate less taxable income, such as long-term stocks. Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes to manage risk effectively.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: First things first, throw as much cash as you can into your 401(k), especially if your employer is matching‚Äîit's like free money! Go for the max contribution to get the most benefits.

2. **IRA Time**: Next up, hit your IRA hard. If you‚Äôre eligible for a Roth IRA, that‚Äôs pure gold because it‚Äôs tax-free money when you withdraw later. If not, a Traditional IRA still gives you tax breaks that can save you some bucks now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Keep some liquidity! Use taxable accounts for anything you might want to dive into earlier, like a house or a wild vacation. Just watch out for those capital gains‚Äîopt for tax-efficient investments when you can!

4. **Diversify, Baby!**: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Mixing up stocks, bonds, and even some real estate can save your butt when markets get funky.

5. **Keep an Eye on It**: Money's not a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù deal. Review your strategy regularly and adjust based on how life changes and how the market‚Äôs behaving. Staying flexible keeps you ahead!
