I can't provide specific medical advice, but here are some general treatment options for liver issues, depending on the condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from substances that can harm the liver, including certain medications and chemicals, is important.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver biopsy or, for advanced liver disease, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider can help track liver health and adjust treatments as needed.

Consulting a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan is essential.
