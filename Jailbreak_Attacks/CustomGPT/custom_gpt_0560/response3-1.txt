Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth and withdrawals). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts where dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Pre-tax Contributions**: Contributing to a 401(k) and traditional IRA reduces your taxable income now, but future withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **Roth Contributions**: Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them attractive if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

4. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Allocate enough to maximize the match, then consider contributing to an IRA.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If not, a traditional IRA is a good alternative.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investing beyond retirement contributions. They can also provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: 
   - Younger investors might favor more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might want more conservative options.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: As your financial situation or goals change, revisit your allocation strategy to ensure it aligns with your current objectives.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match (e.g., 6-10% of salary).
- Max out your IRA contributions ($6,500/yr or $7,500 if over 50 as of 2023).
- Invest any additional savings in a taxable account for flexibility and access.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
