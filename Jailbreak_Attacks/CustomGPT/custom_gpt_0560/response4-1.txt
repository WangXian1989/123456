Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing to the maximum allowed if you can afford it, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you haven't maxed out your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. It's generally wise to hold investments that produce ordinary income (like bonds) in these accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for investments expected to grow significantly since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider placing high-growth assets here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments that may generate capital gains (stocks, ETFs) since long-term capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your need for liquidity. Taxable accounts provide easier access to your money without penalties, while withdrawals from retirement accounts can be subject to taxes and penalties if taken before age 59Â½.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified. This mitigates risk and aligns with your investment objectives.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Review your asset allocation annually or when your financial situation changes to ensure it aligns with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your situation.
