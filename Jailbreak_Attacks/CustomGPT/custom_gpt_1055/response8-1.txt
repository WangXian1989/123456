Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. Consider a Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. Taxable accounts can be useful for short-term goals or if you may need access to funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are aligned with your risk tolerance and timeline. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, but be mindful of tax implications (e.g., holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts may be more beneficial).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Traditional accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a tailored strategy, consider working with a financial advisor who can help you optimize your investment distribution based on your individual needs.

It's essential to align your strategy with both your short-term financial goals and your long-term retirement objectives.
