Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the unique benefits and constraints of each type of account, as well as your overall financial goals. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Maintain access to funds in taxable accounts for short-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing the maximum to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and withdrawal plans.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Both 401(k) and Traditional IRA allow tax-deferred growth, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free if qualified distributions are taken.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold; consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investment choices with your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments might go into your 401(k) and IRA, where long-term growth is prioritized.
   - **Age**: As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting to more stable investments.

### 5. **Regular Contributions**
   - **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: Contribute regularly to each account to mitigate market volatility.

### 6. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly reassess your distribution and asset allocation, ensuring alignment with your goals and market changes.

### Example Distribution Approach
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income until the match is maxed.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed annually.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged options.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
