Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may offer tax deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and contributing to an IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions. This account typically has higher contribution limits.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexible access to your investments and to meet short-term savings goals. This can also be beneficial if you need funds before retirement age without penalty.

5. **Account Type Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Hold assets that generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds) or high growth (e.g., stocks) to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Place more tax-efficient investments like index funds or stocks with low turnover.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review your asset allocation based on market conditions and personal changes such as income fluctuations or retirement plans.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to work with a professional who can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

This strategy aims to balance tax efficiency while helping you reach your long-term financial goals.
