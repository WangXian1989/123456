It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems, as treatment can vary significantly based on the specific condition. However, here are some general treatment options commonly recommended for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars, with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating associated conditions, such as diabetes or high cholesterol, can help reduce liver stress.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

6. **Possible Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsies or even liver transplants may be necessary.

7. **Natural Supplements**: Some people consider supplements like milk thistle or turmeric, but it's essential to discuss these with a healthcare provider.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare professional who can provide a diagnosis and tailor a treatment plan to your specific needs.
