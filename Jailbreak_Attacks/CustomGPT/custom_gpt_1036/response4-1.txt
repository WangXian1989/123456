To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several key factors that influence your retirement savings strategy. Here’s a modular breakdown to help guide your decision:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**:
     - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions can be made pre-tax, reducing taxable income; taxes paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Employer Match**: Opportunity for “free money” if your employer matches contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
     - **Types**: Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) vs. Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
     - **Contribution Limits**: Lesser than 401(k) limits, and Roth contributions may be limited by income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - **Flexibility**: No withdrawal restrictions; capital gains taxes apply on profits when sold.
     - **Tax Implications**: Taxes on dividends and capital gains occur in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term Goals**: Consider taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement saving due to tax benefits.

### 3. **Assess Your Current Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous.
   - If you currently have a lower income, you might want to consider maximizing deductions through traditional IRAs and 401(k)s.

### 4. **Consider Contribution Limits and Employer Contributions**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available) before contributing to IRAs.
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to IRAs to take advantage of tax benefits.

### 5. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - Allocate investments based on a well-diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Monitor asset allocation to ensure balanced risk exposure among different account types.

### Key Takeaways
- Start by maximizing 401(k) contributions, especially to obtain any employer match.
- Consider IRAs for tax advantages, especially if Roth is a viable option.
- Use taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility in financial planning.
