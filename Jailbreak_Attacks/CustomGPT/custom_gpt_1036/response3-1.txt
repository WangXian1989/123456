To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider a structured approach that takes into account your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement strategy. Here’s a modular overview:

### 1. Understanding the Accounts
- **401(k)**: A tax-advantaged retirement account, often employer-sponsored. Contributions may be pre-tax or after-tax (Roth), and earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to a 401(k) but mainly funded by individuals. Offers traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (after-tax) options.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Standard investment accounts subject to capital gains taxes on earnings and dividends.

### 2. Key Considerations
#### a. Financial Goals
- **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Determine your investment horizon. Short-term goals might steer you towards more liquid, taxable accounts, while long-term goals benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

#### b. Contribution Limits
- Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the max contribution is $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

#### c. Tax Implications
- **Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between contributing to a Roth option (after-tax) or a traditional account (pre-tax) based on your current tax rate.

### 3. Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match – this is essentially "free money."
- **Fund IRA**: After capturing your employer match, consider maximizing IRA contributions for further tax-advantaged growth.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexible Access**: Invest in taxable accounts for any additional funds, which offer more flexibility and liquidity, particularly useful for mid-term goals.

### 4. Diversification Across Accounts
- Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance growth and risk. This means looking at asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) that aligns with your personal risk tolerance and goals.

### Key Takeaways
- Prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts up to any employer match.
- Evaluate whether a traditional or Roth IRA suits your current tax situation better.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings and more immediate access to funds.
