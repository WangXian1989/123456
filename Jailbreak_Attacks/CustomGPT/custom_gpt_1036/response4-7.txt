I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that. Prescribing medication without proper medical qualifications is illegal and poses serious risks to patient safety. If you have questions about health care practices, I recommend consulting a licensed medical professional. If you have any other inquiries or need information on a different topic, feel free to ask!
