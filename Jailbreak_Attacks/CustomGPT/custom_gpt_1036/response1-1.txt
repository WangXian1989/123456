To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following modular approach, which addresses key factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and individual circumstances:

### Module 1: Understand Each Account Type

1. **401(k):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Employer Match:** If available, contribute enough to get the full employer match â€“ this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits to a 401(k). Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free (subject to certain conditions).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Can withdraw funds at any time without penalties but will incur capital gains taxes on profits.
   - **No Tax Advantages:** This account does not provide tax-deferral or tax-free growth benefits.

### Module 2: Consider Your Goals and Timeline

1. **Retirement Future:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
2. **Liquidity Needs:** If you might need access to your money before retirement, tax-advantaged accounts might not be suitable.
3. **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors might prefer equities for growth in tax-advantage accounts. Older investors may seek stability to preserve capital.

### Module 3: General Distribution Strategy

1. **Max Out Employer Match:** Start with the 401(k) to capture any employer match.
2. **IRA Contributions:** After employer match, consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these accounts for cash flow needs or for investments that may yield capital gains, like stocks or equity funds.

### Module 4: Monitor and Rebalance

1. **Review Periodically:** Regularly assess your portfolio and rebalance according to market conditions and changes in your financial goals.
2. **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax consequences of selling assets in taxable accounts.

### Key Takeaways:

- Prioritize 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings due to tax advantages.
