To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here's a modular breakdown:

### 1. **Understanding Each Account Type**

- **401(k)**: 
  - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), reducing taxable income now or allowing tax-free withdrawals later.
  - **Employer Match**: If available, contribute at least enough to get the full employer match â€“ it's essentially "free money".

- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: 
  - **Types**: Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
  - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 in 2023 for under 50; $7,500 for 50+).

- **Taxable Accounts**: 
  - **Flexibility**: No contribution limits or early withdrawal penalties, allowing for easy access to funds.
  - **Investment Choices**: More diversified investment options compared to retirement accounts.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**

- **Short-term vs. Long-term**: 
  - For short-term goals (within 5 years), prioritize taxable accounts for accessibility.
  - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**

- **Tax Efficiency**: 
  - Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA first due to tax advantages.
  - Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **General Distribution Strategy**

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Ensure you are contributing enough to get any employer match offered.
   
2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Focus on either a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
   
3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue with contributions to your 401(k) until reaching the contribution limit.
   
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any excess funds for investments in taxable accounts. This can provide liquidity, and you can manage your tax liability through capital gains.

### 5. **Key Takeaways**

- Leverage employer matches in 401(k) plans.
- Prioritize contributions to retirement accounts (IRA, 401(k)) for tax efficiency.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility, especially for short-term goals.

### 6. **Questions for You**

- What is your current financial situation and income level?
- Do you have immediate financial goals or are you focused solely on retirement?
- Are you considering working with a financial advisor for personalized advice?
