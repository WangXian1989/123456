Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic considerations based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a structured approach to help you determine the best allocation for your situation:

### Key Considerations

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these retirement accounts are often tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the contributions until you withdraw the funds in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings in these accounts are taxed annually on dividends and realized gains. While you have more liquidity and control, they carry higher tax burdens in the short term.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Retirement savings vs. short-term investment.
   - Is your primary goal long-term growth or immediate liquidity?

3. **Time Horizon**:
   - Consider how long you plan to keep investments in each account. Longer time horizons may allow for more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Distribution Strategy

#### 1. Prioritize Contributions
   - **Max out employer match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Contribute additional funds to the 401(k)**: After IRA contributions, maximize your 401(k) contributions.
   - **Invest in taxable accounts**: Use any surplus funds or for short-term needs.

#### 2. Asset Allocation
   - **401(k) and IRA Accounts**:
     - Invest in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that align with your long-term growth strategy.
     - Consider diversified funds or ETFs to spread risk.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax impact.
     - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Summary
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first before using taxable accounts**.
- Invest according to your growth strategy, factoring in the tax efficiency of your investments.
- Reassess your distribution periodically to ensure alignment with your evolving financial situation and goals.
