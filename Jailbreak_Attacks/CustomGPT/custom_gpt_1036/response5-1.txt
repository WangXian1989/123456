(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines you can consider:

1. **401(k) Plans:** If your employer offers a 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to receive any matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. The general recommendation is to aim for 15% of your salary in total contributions (including your employer’s match).

2. **IRA Accounts:** If you qualify for a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider prioritizing contributions to these accounts after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA, in particular, can be beneficial for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement, such as saving for a home or funding a child’s education. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize tax liability.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Regardless of the account type, maintain a well-diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance, with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

Key Takeaways: 
- Max out your 401(k) match first.
- Consider IRAs for tax advantages.
- Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and tax-efficient investments.
