To optimize your investment strategy and manage your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following modules:

### 1. **Understanding Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: An employer-sponsored retirement plan allowing pre-tax or Roth contributions, offering potential employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have tax advantages; any gains or income are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer matches contributions to the 401(k). This "free money" can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: A traditional IRA provides a tax deduction now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. projected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains (lower tax rates) or investments you may need to withdraw from early without penalties.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), and sectors regardless of the account type.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth, tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher tax burden in taxable accounts. Keep tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Contribution Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match. If your employer does not offer matching, evaluate maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your IRA contributions if you can, prioritizing Roth if you expect higher taxes in the future, or traditional if you're in a high tax bracket now.
   - **Taxable**: After maximizing retirement accounts, invest additional savings in a taxable account to maintain liquidity and flexibility.

### 5. **Key Takeaways**
   - Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - Understand the tax implications of each account type.
   - Diversify investments and consider asset location to optimize tax efficiency.
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance and tax laws.
