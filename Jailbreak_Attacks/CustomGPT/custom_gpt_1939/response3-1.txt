Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Diversification**
   - **401(k):** Traditional contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Roth options (if available) use after-tax dollars for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), you can choose a traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (after-tax) IRA. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rate when selecting.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but they provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 3. **Investment Vehicles and Growth Potential**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to shield gains from taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs), which may distribute fewer capital gains.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals for retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions each year or as your financial situation changes.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, consult with a financial advisor who can consider your unique situation.

Overall, aiming for a balanced approach that considers both growth potential and tax implications will help optimize your money distribution strategy.
