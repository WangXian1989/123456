Allocating your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** Depending on your income level, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **Continue with 401(k):** After maxing out contributions to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) to your desired limit. This might also help lower your taxable income.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you have additional funds, consider taxable investment accounts for flexibility in accessing your money without penalties for early withdrawals, unlike retirement accounts.

5. **Tax-Efficient Investment Choices:** Be mindful of the types of investments placed in each account. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) are often suited for taxable accounts, while higher-growth or income-generating assets may be better for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon:** If you’re closer to retirement, it may be wise to shift towards more stable investments in your retirement accounts, whereas taxable accounts could hold more growth-oriented investments if time allows.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Monitor your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and market conditions.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual needs and circumstances.
