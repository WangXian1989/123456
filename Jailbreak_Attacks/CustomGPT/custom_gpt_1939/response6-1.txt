Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for tax optimization and retirement planning. Here’s a brief guide on how to approach this allocation:

### Key Considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, with taxes deferred until withdrawal. Consider maxing out employer match if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax on profits. Suitable for short-term goals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your investment timeframe (short-term vs. long-term) to better understand your investment risk profile.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:

- **Max out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Always take advantage of any employer contributions—free money!
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, allocate any remaining funds here for shorter-term goals or for access before retirement.

### Suggested Allocation:

- **401(k)**: 20-30% of your total investment savings
- **IRA**: 20-30% of your total investment savings
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40-60%, adjusting based on your liquidity needs

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first, you can maximize your tax benefits and savings potential over time. Always tailor this strategy to your personal financial situation and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
