The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** Once you’ve funded your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you still have funds left to invest once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short- to medium-term goals, as funds here can be accessed without penalties.

5. **Consider Taxes:** Keep in mind the tax implications of drawing from each account type in retirement. Distributions from traditional accounts may be taxed as ordinary income, whereas Roth accounts provide tax-free growth.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of the account type, diversifying your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts is key to managing risk and achieving growth.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
