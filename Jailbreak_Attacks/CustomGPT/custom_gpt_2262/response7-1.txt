Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general framework to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a diversified mix of investments within the 401(k) that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
  
2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you want to lower your taxable income now, a Traditional IRA might be better.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions if you can, as they have tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for shorter-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Investments here don’t have the same tax benefits but can be access easily.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable events.

### Key Considerations:
- **Time Horizon**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term savings and use taxable accounts for short-term needs.
- **Tax Bracket**: Assess your current and expected future tax situation. Balancing contributions can help minimize your overall tax burden.
- **Diversification**: Ensure that your entire portfolio is diversified across asset classes and investment vehicles.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional).
- Place any additional savings into a taxable account, focusing on long-term investments.
