Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Consider taxable accounts for short-term expenses.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to your IRA for additional tax advantages.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred; withdrawals taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Options**: If eligible, Roth IRA contributions can grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Adjust based on risk tolerance and timeline; maintain a balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring liquidity for short-term needs.
