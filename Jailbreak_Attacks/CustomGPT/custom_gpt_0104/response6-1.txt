To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Then aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may provide liquidity or require withdrawals before retirement age. This includes stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes, while holding higher-growth assets (like individual stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for deferred tax growth.

4. **Continuous Review**:
   - Regularly assess your contributions and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

By prioritizing these areas, you can optimize growth while managing your tax implications effectively.
