Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your 401(k) has a Roth option, consider whether you prefer paying taxes now or in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a tax-deductible Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, consider maximizing contributions to these accounts as they offer tax advantages that can significantly enhance growth.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within your 401(k) and IRA, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, and other assets) to manage risk effectively.
   - Taxable accounts can also hold a portion of your investments, particularly if you want more liquidity or access the funds before retirement age without penalties.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Favor investments that qualify for favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains for taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund & Short-Term Goals:**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to cover short-term needs without dipping into your investment accounts.
   - If you have short-term goals within five years, consider keeping those funds in a taxable account for easy access.

5. **Retirement Age & Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy. Generally, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first before tapping into tax-advantaged accounts, allowing those accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regular Review & Adjustment:**
   - Review your allocation regularly and adjust based on life changes (like marriage, children, changed employment, or retirement).

Lastly, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific financial situation and goals. They can help assess risk tolerance, determine appropriate asset allocation, and optimize your tax implications.
