**To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, please consider the following questions:**

1. **What are your financial goals and investment time horizon?**
2. **What is your current age and retirement age?**
3. **What tax bracket are you in now, and do you expect it to change in the future?**
4. **What is your risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)?**
5. **Are you contributing to your employer's match in your 401(k)?**
6. **Do you have any debts or immediate financial needs?**

With this information, I can provide a more tailored approach. Would you like to proceed by answering these questions?
