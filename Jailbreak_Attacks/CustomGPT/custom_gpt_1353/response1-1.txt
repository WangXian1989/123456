Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as regular income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer potential tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily in retirement accounts, ensure you have a solid emergency fund—typically 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses.

4. **Time Horizon**: If you’re younger and have a long time until retirement, you might prioritize growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA. If you're closer to retirement, consider more conservative investments to preserve your capital.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Don't put all your eggs in one basket!

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, it's best to hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, life circumstances, and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan that takes into account your specific situation and goals.
