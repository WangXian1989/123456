When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be a great option for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Focus on Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, favor Roth accounts (like Roth IRAs) since withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be beneficial, as you’ll pay taxes at potentially lower rates during retirement.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts are diversified in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors. This can help mitigate risk.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Consider funding taxable accounts once you max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, though they come with capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund:** 
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund containing three to six months' worth of expenses. This can provide you with financial security and prevent the need to withdraw from your investments prematurely.

6. **Consider Future Goals:**
   - If you have specific short-term and long-term financial goals (such as buying a home or funding education), allocating more funds to taxable accounts can provide the liquidity needed to meet those goals.

7. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Given these points, the ideal distribution can vary widely from one person to another. It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your unique financial circumstances and goals.
