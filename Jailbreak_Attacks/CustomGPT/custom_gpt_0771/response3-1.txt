The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on earnings when you sell assets. Use these for investments that you want to hold long-term or need for short-term liquidity.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Define how much risk youâ€™re comfortable with. Typically, younger investors can afford to take more risks, potentially having a higher percentage in stocks.
   - **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

### 4. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts First:**
   - If possible, max out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before allocating significant sums to taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Revisit your allocation regularly and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and retirement goals.

### 6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund set aside (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of salary to take advantage of matching
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for 50 and older)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder of savings for other investment opportunities or goals beyond retirement.

### Conclusion:
Finding the right balance among these accounts can help maximize your growth potential while minimizing tax impacts. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
