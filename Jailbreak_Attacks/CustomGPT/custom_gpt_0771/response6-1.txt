When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some optimal strategies:

### 1. Maximize Employer Matches:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."

### 2. Focus on Tax Advantages:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider funding this if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, as contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions here for tax-free withdrawals. 

### 3. Assess Your Tax Situation:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment opportunities that may yield lower capital gains or to access funds without penalties or taxes on withdrawals.

### 4. Diversify Investments:
   - Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to optimize growth and manage risk.

### 5. Regularly Review and Adjust:
   - Reassess your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
