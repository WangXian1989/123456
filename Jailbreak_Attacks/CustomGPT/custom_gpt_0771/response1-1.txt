Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions, especially if your employer matches. Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings that you might need before retirement. They provide flexibility without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Invest based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term growth, consider equities in your retirement accounts and blend in more conservative investments in your taxable account.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and rebalance your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Every situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to seek personalized advice.

Remember, this is a general guide—tailor your approach based on your specific circumstances.
