To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Your Tax Situations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this to maximize free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can also provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals. Decide based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't have tax advantages but allow for more flexibility. They can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age.

2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Long-term investments (e.g., retirement) should be focused on accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
   - Shorter-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, cash) across accounts to manage risk. Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Remember the annual contribution limits for each account. Maximize contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs first before moving money to taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to manage tax implications.

Speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation and goals.
