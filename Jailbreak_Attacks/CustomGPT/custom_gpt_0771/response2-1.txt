Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Use low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available. 

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions if possible. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains tax.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Short-term Goals**: Keep more money in taxable accounts for liquidity.
2. **Medium- to Long-term Goals**: Maximize 401(k) and IRA contributions for tax advantages.
3. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Regular Review:
- Adjust your contributions and allocations yearly or as your financial situation changes.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances is often a good idea.
