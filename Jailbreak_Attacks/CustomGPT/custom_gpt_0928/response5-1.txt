Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your investment goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **Investment Options**: Typically, 401(k) plans offer limited investment options. Choose a mix of funds that align with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).
   - **Diversification**: IRAs generally offer a broader range of investments compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide greater flexibility in trading and withdrawals without penalty.
   - **Tax Management**: Capital gains taxes apply, so consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### **General Strategy**:
- Start by maxing out your 401(k) match, then consider fully funding an IRA.
- Use your taxable account for investing after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.
- Diversify investments across all accounts based on your overall strategy.
- Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as needed.

### **Key Considerations**:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may allocate more to stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds to reduce risk.
- **Future Tax Implications**: Consider your expected tax rate in retirement when choosing between a Traditional IRA and Roth IRA.
