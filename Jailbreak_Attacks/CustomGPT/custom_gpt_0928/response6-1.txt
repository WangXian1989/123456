Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and overall financial strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Prioritize Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you'll need before retirement or for investments that generate dividends or short-term gains, as these are taxed at ordinary income rates.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Ensure a balanced investment approach across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Adjust asset allocation based on account type: more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative ones in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure.

### 4. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### 5. **Seek Professional Guidance:**
   - A financial advisor can help tailor your distribution strategy to your specific circumstances, ensuring optimal long-term growth and tax efficiency.

By balancing contributions across these accounts and considering tax implications, you can build a robust financial strategy for retirement.
