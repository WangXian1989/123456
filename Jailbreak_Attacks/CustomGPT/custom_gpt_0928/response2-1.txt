Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Plan**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match (it’s free money). If you're under 50, the contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500, and $30,000 if you're 50 or older.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older.
   - **Choice Between Traditional and Roth**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, a Traditional IRA may provide a tax benefit now.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, allocate money to taxable accounts. These can provide more access to funds without penalties for withdrawal.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient (like bonds) to mitigate tax implications.

### 3. **Diversity of Investments**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.
   - Consider using tax-efficient investment strategies in your taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains and taxes.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.

### Summary
A typical order might look like this:
1. Max out 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to IRA (Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
3. Invest in taxable accounts for additional growth and flexibility.

Tailoring this approach to your unique situation is key!
