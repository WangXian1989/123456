Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you can consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth; employer contributions may be available. Good for high contributions with potential employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages either through traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth) contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. Useful for medium-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; typically, this is free money.
   - **Max IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (especially Roth if you qualify).
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: If you have money left after maxing your IRA, consider contributing more to your 401(k), especially if it offers low-cost investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use any remaining funds for a taxable account to ensure liquidity for short- to medium-term needs.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth with a diversified mix of equities and bonds, depending on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Revisit and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, goals, and market conditions.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): Max out to employer match + additional contributions.
- IRA: Max out contributions if possible.
- Taxable: Use leftovers for flexible investing.

By following this strategic approach, you'll effectively distribute your money to work toward retirement and other financial goals while considering tax implications.
