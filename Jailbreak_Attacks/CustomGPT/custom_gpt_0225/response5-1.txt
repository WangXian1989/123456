(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially "free money."
2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate higher capital gains or dividends, as you'll pay taxes on those in the current year.

Balancing contributions based on tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs is key. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

1. **401(k)**: Max out that employer match. Seriously, itâ€™s free money! Hit that limit as fast as you can.
2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, go all-in on a Rothâ€”tax-free gains are like finding the holy grail of investing. Even if you canâ€™t, traditional IRAs are still golden for tax breaks.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once those are maxed out, letâ€™s stash some cash here. This is where you get more flexibility, but watch out for those tax hits. Use it for shares with lower turnover to minimize taxes.

Mix it up based on your goals, how much you want to save for retirement versus spending now, and definitely think about chatting with a pro if you're feeling overwhelmed!
