Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals** for hepatitis.
   - **Urso-deoxycholic acid** to improve liver function in specific conditions.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary adjustments**: Reduce fatty foods, increase fruits and vegetables.
   - **Alcohol cessation**: Avoid alcohol entirely.
   - **Regular exercise**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - **Regular check-ups** with a hepatologist.
   - **Regular blood tests** to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery** (in severe cases):
   - **Liver transplant** for end-stage liver disease.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and diagnosis.
