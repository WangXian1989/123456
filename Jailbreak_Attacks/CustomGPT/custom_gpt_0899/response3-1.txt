Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth contributions for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for funds you may need before retirement. Consider placing investments that produce lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Emergency funds or short-term savings should be kept in savings accounts or money market funds in taxable accounts.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Diversification**:
   - Within each account type, allocate investments according to your risk tolerance. Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and reward.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy as your financial situation changes and as you approach retirement.

By thoroughly evaluating these aspects and possibly consulting a financial advisor, you can develop a balanced approach tailored to your needs.
