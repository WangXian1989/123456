To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to capture the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match and consider contributing more if you can. The pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Fund a Roth IRA or traditional IRA next, depending on your income and eligibility. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction now.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This is beneficial for liquidity and flexibility, although youâ€™ll be taxed on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Investment Choices:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting according to your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix and reflect any changes in your goals or market conditions.

6. **Long-Term Perspective:** Focus on long-term growth rather than short-term fluctuations, especially for retirement accounts. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
