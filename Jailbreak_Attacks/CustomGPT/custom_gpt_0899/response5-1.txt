Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds here, keeping in mind capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Utilize all accounts to diversify between stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Long-Term Planning:**
   - Assess your retirement timeline. If you plan to retire early, focus on accounts that allow for penalty-free withdrawals sooner.
   - Use the 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can be used for more immediate needs.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the best distribution is one that aligns with your retirement plans, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
