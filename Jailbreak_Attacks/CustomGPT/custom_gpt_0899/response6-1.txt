To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth and possible employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Allows for tax-deductible contributions (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provides flexibility for withdrawals but incurs taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)).
   - Maximize 401(k) contributions to take advantage of employer matches and tax deferral.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate different asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.
   - Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., stocks in 401(k), bonds in IRAs) to maximize tax efficiency.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and market conditions.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay within annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize benefits. 

By blending these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to managing your investments and tax implications.
