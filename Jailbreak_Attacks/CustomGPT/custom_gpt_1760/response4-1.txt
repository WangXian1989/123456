To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
    - **401(k)**: Since contributions are made pre-tax, this is beneficial for reducing your taxable income. Focus on higher-risk, higher-growth investments here since you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
    - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
    - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate income (like bonds) or investments that you may need to access before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains distributions.

3. **Investment Choices**:
    - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where you benefit from tax deferral.
    - Keep income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on withdrawals from the tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and adjust your contributions accordingly to maximize your savings without exceeding limits.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

Itâ€™s important to tailor your distribution strategy based on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
