To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential employer matches, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that offers tax advantages, with lower contribution limits than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but you pay taxes on realized gains and dividends.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**  
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If possible, contribute the maximum allowable to your IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Continue with 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, emergency funds, or to achieve specific short-term goals.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and target-date funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you may have a broader range of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax implications.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold bonds and high-dividend stocks here, as they may be taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Assess your allocations at least annually. Rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

### 6. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Align your investment strategy with your long-term retirement goals. Use tools or consult a financial advisor to tailor your plan.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy depends on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your allocations will help you stay on track towards your retirement goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
