Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs, in particular, can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) to reach the annual contribution limit, especially if your employer continues to match.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you maximize tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable brokerage accounts for additional investing. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility if you need funds before retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider varying the asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Regularly reassess your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
