It's great that you're thinking about how to allocate your investments! Here are a few general strategies to consider when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can allow for tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, you might want to lean more toward a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - In contrast, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can distribute funds in a taxable account.
   - Use this account for investments that may benefit from capital gains tax rates or dividend income.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Consider placing more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes while holding less volatile investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where they are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Since individual circumstances can vary widely, personalized advice from a financial planner can be very beneficial.
