(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a balanced approach involves:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing at least enough to get the full match, then decide on an additional amount based on your budget and retirement goals.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. The Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investment options, particularly if you've already maxed out your contributions to retirement accounts. This is also a good place to hold investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation, especially regarding asset allocation and tax implications.

1. **401(k)**: Go hard on this if your employer matches. That's free money, baby! Aim to max out or at least stack what your employer will match. Itâ€™s like getting paid to save!

2. **IRA**: Next up, initialize your IRA game. Roth is awesome for future tax-free cash-outs, while Traditional saves you some tax dough now. Aim for the maximum contribution when you canâ€”but donâ€™t neglect to enjoy life!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve hit those juicy tax-advantaged accounts, throw some bucks into taxable accounts. You can dip into these whenever you want, but keep an eye on capital gains tax; it can sneak up on you!

Mix and match like a DJ at a party, but also consider your own risk tolerance and timeline. And yeah, maybe consult a pro if your finances get a bit too wild! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’¸
