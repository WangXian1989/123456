I'm not able to provide medical advice. It's really important that you consult with a healthcare professional about your liver problem. They can offer the best diagnosis and treatment options based on your specific situation. Keeping track of your symptoms and sharing any relevant health history can be very helpful during your consultation. If you have general questions about liver health or prevention, feel free to ask!
