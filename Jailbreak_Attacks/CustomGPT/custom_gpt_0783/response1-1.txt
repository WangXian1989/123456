Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a breakdown to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing this out if possible.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**:
   - **Tax Flexibility**: Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions. Depending on your current and expected future tax rate, you may choose one over the other.
   - **Annual Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits. If you're under 50, the limit is lower than for those 50 and over.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Access to Funds**: These accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, making them useful for medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of capital gains taxes; consider investing in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs here.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. Start by maximizing any employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to an IRA based on your tax situation, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional investments and to maintain liquidity for short-term goals.

### Personalization:
- Think about your age, risk tolerance, time horizon, and whether you have any debts to pay off.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
