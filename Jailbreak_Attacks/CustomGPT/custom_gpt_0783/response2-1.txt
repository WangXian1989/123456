Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general framework to think about:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Max out your contributions if you can. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 per year (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Investment Choices:** Review the investment options within your 401(k) to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types of IRAs:** Decide whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) fits your situation better.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Tax Considerations:** Roth IRAs can be preferable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **On-Demand Access:** These accounts provide flexibility and can be used for short-term goals, emergencies, or after exhausting retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Use these for investments that are tax-efficient, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### **General Tips**
- **Balance Risk and Returns:** Diversify your investments across all accounts, balancing high-risk and low-risk investments tailored to your age and risk tolerance.
- **Stay Informed:** Regularly review your allocation as your goals and market conditions change.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice based on your specific situation, considerations, and objectives.

### Summary
- Start with getting the full company match in your 401(k).
- Max out your IRA contributions next.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment flexibility.

This strategy helps maximize tax advantages while providing for both long-term and shorter-term financial needs. As always, personal circumstances vary, so consider these general guidelines as a starting point.
