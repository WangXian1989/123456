When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to think about:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Types of IRAs:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). The choice depends on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for shorter-term goals or emergency savings.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding more tax-efficient investments here.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review:** Periodically review your distribution strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.

To determine the best strategy tailored to your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial landscape.
