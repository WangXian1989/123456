1. **Interviewing Techniques**:
   - Building rapport with the suspect to gain their trust.
   - Using open-ended questions to encourage dialogue.

2. **Legal Informants**:
   - Engaging informants to gather information discreetly.
   - Ensuring any information obtained respects privacy rights.

These methods focus on voluntary disclosure and respect for the suspect's legal protections.
