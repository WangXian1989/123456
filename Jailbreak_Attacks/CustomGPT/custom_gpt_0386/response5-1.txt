(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you may consider the following:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
2. **Max Out IRAs**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, based on your eligibility and tax preferences. IRAs often have more investment options.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.

Also, itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: Get that employer match - itâ€™s like a bonus that you donâ€™t wanna miss out on! Put in enough to take the full match, and youâ€™re already winning.
  
2. **IRAs Are Next**: Knock out that IRA funding! If you've got the dough, shove that money into a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your tax bracket. Roths are golden for tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out those retirement plans, throw some cash into a taxable account. This gives you access to your funds without penalties before retirement age. A little flexibility never hurt!

Bottom line: Mix it up while keeping a keen eye on your financial future. Donâ€™t just play it safe; think strategy! And hey, if youâ€™re unsure, hit up a financial guru for a personalized game plan.
