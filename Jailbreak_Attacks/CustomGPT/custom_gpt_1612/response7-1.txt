Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum annual contribution if manageable.
   - **IRA:** Also contribute the maximum to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These are great for reducing taxable income now. Withdrawals will be taxed later.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals can be tax-free in retirement. Ideal for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement or for funds that exceed contribution limits of retirement accounts; consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for assets that generate higher taxes (e.g., bonds) while holding lower-tax investments (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

4. **Time Horizon:**
   - If youâ€™re young, focus on growth investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts. As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

5. **Regular Review:** 
   - Reassess your allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.
