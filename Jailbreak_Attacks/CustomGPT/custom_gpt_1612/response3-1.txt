Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit (and utilize any match). Consider if your plan offers Roth options.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These are flexible for withdrawals and can be advantageous for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets suitable for your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Taxes**: 
   - Higher income can lead to increased tax rates, so prioritize tax-deferred accounts when your salary is high. 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxable income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance them to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized plan can maximize your tax efficiency and align with your retirement goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced strategy for distributing your investments.
