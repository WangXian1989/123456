Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match—this is often considered "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out traditional or Roth IRA contributions, depending on your eligibility and retirement goals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed annually, so use these for more accessible funds or investments that generate minimal income.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth investments (stocks, ETFs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize tax efficiency.
   - **Income Generation**: If you are investing for income (dividends), consider placing these investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Periodically assess your allocations based on market performance, contributions, and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
A balanced strategy might be to heavily fund your 401(k) and IRA first, then use taxable accounts for additional investment diversification. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
