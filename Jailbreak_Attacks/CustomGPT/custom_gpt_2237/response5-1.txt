Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, deferring taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Tax advantages vary. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Emergency Savings and Short-Term Goals**
   - Keep a portion of your assets in **taxable accounts** for liquidity. This might include savings for emergencies or short-term goals.

### 4. **Long-Term Investment Growth**
   - Focus on maximizing your contributions to **tax-advantaged accounts** first (401(k) and IRAs), especially if your tax rate is higher now than you expect in retirement.

### 5. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (especially a Roth if you expect higher taxes later).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds for short-term needs or tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds).

### Regular Review:
- Periodically reassess your strategy as tax laws, financial goals, and market conditions change.
