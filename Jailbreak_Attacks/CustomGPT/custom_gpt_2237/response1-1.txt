To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Tax Benefits of Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maximizing employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are less tax-efficient, but they offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Consider your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and retirement accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify investments according to your risk tolerance. Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts due to their interest income being taxed at higher rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Use taxable accounts first, then traditional IRAs, and finally, Roth IRAs to manage your tax bracket strategically.

5. **Regular Reviews:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and contributions. Rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider seeking advice tailored to your situation for personalized strategies.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth while minimizing taxes.
