Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After getting the match, consider contributing to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly enhance your savings.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** If you still have room in your budget, continue maximizing your contributions to your 401(k). Higher contribution limits than IRAs make it easier to save more.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've contributed enough to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional savings or investment flexibility. These accounts can provide liquidity and allow for investments in different asset classes without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Investments in these accounts can be sold, triggering a tax bill based on profits.

6. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Reassessment:** Periodically review your allocations as your financial goals, market conditions, and personal circumstances change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these general guidelines to your specific situation.
