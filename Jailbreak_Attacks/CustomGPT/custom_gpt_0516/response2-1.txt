Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs (Traditional or Roth) before adding to taxable accounts. This helps in tax deferral or tax-free growth.

3. **Account Type Consideration**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, these accounts are pre-tax, meaning your contributions lower your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Consider higher growth investments here.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with income limits on deductibility. Good for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free. Ideal for long-term growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments based on performance and changes in financial goals or risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth (higher equity allocation), while those nearing retirement may shift towards more conservative investments (bonds and fixed income).

6. **Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts when buying and selling investments. Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains when possible.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Have a plan for withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax impacts, including withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and then Roth accounts last.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specifically to your situation.
