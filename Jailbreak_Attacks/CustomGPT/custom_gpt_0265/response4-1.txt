To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like index funds), since capital gains tax applies.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust asset allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals and the associated tax implications, especially from tax-deferred accounts.
