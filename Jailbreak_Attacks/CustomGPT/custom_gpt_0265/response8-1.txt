To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages and increased investment options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments based on risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Typically, keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Place dividend-paying stocks or high-interest investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income in the current year.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
