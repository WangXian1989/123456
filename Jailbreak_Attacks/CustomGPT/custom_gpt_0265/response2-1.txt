Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribute enough to get any employer match.** This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Traditional or Roth IRA**
   - **Choose based on your tax situation:**
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest in tax-efficient assets** here, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Use for short-term goals** or needs that may arise before retirement.

### 4. **General Allocation Tips**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies outside of investment accounts.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your allocations based on your comfort with risk.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across various asset classes.

### 5. **Revisit Annually**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing life circumstances.
