Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts allow for more flexibility with withdrawals, though they might incur capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, focus more on Roth contributions. If you expect to be in a higher bracket later, prioritize traditional accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes in each account to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund to avoid tapping into retirement accounts prematurely.

### 7. **Regular Review**
   - Revisit your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your unique circumstances.
