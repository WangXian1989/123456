Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Balancing contributions here can help manage tax liabilities in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and can be tapped without penalties before retirement age.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in long-term capital gain assets or tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on earnings.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Short-Term Goals**: Prioritize taxable accounts for easier access.
- **Medium to Long-Term Goals**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
- **Regular Reviews**: Adjust your allocation annually based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Additional Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings outside of these accounts.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can provide clarity based on your specific situation.
