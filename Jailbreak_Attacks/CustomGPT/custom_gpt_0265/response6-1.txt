Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in stocks, ETFs, and other assets with lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Maintain Liquidity Needs:**
   - Allocate some funds to a taxable account for short-term needs, allowing easy access without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Goals:**
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Typically, longer-term investments can be riskier.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance to stay aligned with your investment goals.

By balancing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and accessibility.
