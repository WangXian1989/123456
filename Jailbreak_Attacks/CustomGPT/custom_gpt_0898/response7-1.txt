Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **High Contribution Limits:** The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), allowing for significant tax-advantaged growth.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Choose Based on Income and Tax Situation:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals and investment selections.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes and dividends are taxed as income. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.
   - **Fund Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for shorter-term financial goals or if you need liquidity before retirement.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Build an Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before heavily investing.
2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before funding taxable accounts.
3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:** Balance your contributions based on your current tax bracket and expected future bracket.
4. **Diversify Investments:** Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and account types to optimize tax efficiency and risk management.

### Final Considerations:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs and circumstances.

By managing your contributions wisely across these account types, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
