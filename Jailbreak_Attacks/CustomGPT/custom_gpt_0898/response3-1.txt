Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but has income limits. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now, which can be beneficial depending on your tax bracket.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: If you can afford it, increase your contributions to your 401(k) after maxing out your IRA, focusing on reaching the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider transferring any excess funds to taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility and access, but you'll need to manage the tax implications of capital gains.

5. **Investment Choices**: Diversify your investments within each account type. Typically, hold more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA since they have tax advantages for long-term growth. In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocation based on your changing financial situation and goals.

For personalized advice, consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
