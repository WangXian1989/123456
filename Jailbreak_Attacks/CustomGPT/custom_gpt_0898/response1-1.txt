Distributing your money among different accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now but tax you on withdrawals later.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or income, which could be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. This is also a good place for funds you might need before retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your goals or market conditions change.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of tax implications when choosing investments for each account. For example, put high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider getting personalized advice from a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your goals while optimizing tax efficiency.
