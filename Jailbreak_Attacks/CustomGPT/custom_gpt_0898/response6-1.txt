Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals
   - **Short-term needs:** Aim to have sufficient funds in taxable accounts for immediate access.
   - **Long-term growth:** Focus on contributing more to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement.

### 2. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match if available, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider fully funding your IRA to take advantage of tax deductions or tax-free growth (for Roth IRAs).

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Typically suitable for high-growth assets (stocks) since you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal (traditional) or never (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on income-generating investments (bonds, dividend stocks) to manage tax implications effectively.

### 4. Diversification and Risk Management
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting risk based on investment horizon and individual risk tolerance.

### 5. Monitor and Rebalance
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, life changes, or changes in financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
- Next, contribute to an IRA until you reach the annual limit.
- Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance, as individual circumstances can greatly influence the optimal strategy.
