To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: You have both Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free) options. Evaluate based on your current tax situation and retirement goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for funds needed before retirement or for liquid investments. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when withdrawing.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider the time horizon for each account. Funds for long-term retirement should be more aggressive, while those needed in the short term should be conservatively allocated.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

4. **Annual Limits**: 
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Ensure you're maximizing tax-advantaged accounts before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Summary Strategy:
1. **Max out your 401(k)** (especially to the employer match).
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (consider using Traditional or Roth based on your tax bracket).
3. **Invest any additional funds** into a taxable account.

### Regular Review:
Reassess your allocations regularly to align with changes in your financial situation and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific circumstances can also enhance this strategy.
