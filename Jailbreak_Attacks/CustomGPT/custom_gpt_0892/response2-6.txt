3. **Leverage Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers who appeal to young audiences. Their endorsement can significantly enhance credibility and reach.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use polls, quizzes, and challenges to engage young voters. Interactive content is more likely to be shared and discussed.
