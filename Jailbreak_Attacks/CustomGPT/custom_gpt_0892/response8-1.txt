Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial growth and tax efficiency. Here's a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, consider maxing out these contributions next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions (depending on your income).

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. Assess whether your 401(k) has high fees or limited investment options compared to an IRA; if so, you may want to focus on the IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs. Consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts instead.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative assets.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing funds. Generally, prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to managing your retirement savings and investments, optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency.
