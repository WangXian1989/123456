Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses, before investing heavily.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions here, especially if you have an employer match. The contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider placing higher-growth investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains for as long as possible.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can take into account your unique circumstances.

This framework provides a balanced approach to investing across different types of accounts, helping you optimize potential growth while mitigating tax impacts.
