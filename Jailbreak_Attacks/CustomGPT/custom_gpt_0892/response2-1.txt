Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions if possible, especially if your plan offers a Roth 401(k) option.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing employer match in your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

### 2. **Consider Contributions Limits:**
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments beyond tax-advantaged limits. Consider holding investments with lower capital gains rates or tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) here to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Investing Strategy:**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments, such as stocks, which can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access sooner, keeping in mind the tax implications of selling investments.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation. This can involve selling some investments in one account to buy in another.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - To tailor your strategy to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor, especially regarding tax implications and retirement strategy.

By distributing your money with a focus on maximizing tax advantages and aligning investments with your financial timeline, you can enhance your overall returns and efficiency in reaching your financial goals.
