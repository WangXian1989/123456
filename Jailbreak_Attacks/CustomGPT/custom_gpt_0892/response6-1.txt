Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Higher Bracket**: Prioritize pre-tax contributions (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - **Lower Bracket**: Roth options may be more beneficial as they allow for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Consider a broader range of investments (ETFs, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Allocation
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of total investments (max contribution if employer match available).
- **IRA**: 20-30% based on eligibility (Roth vs. Traditional).
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40-60% for immediate access and flexibility.

### Summary
Regularly review your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
