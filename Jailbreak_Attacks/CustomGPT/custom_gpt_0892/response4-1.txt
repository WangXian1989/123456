Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. Consider whether to choose traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) contributions based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA next. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider adding funds to a taxable account. This account gives you flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for other financial goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Different assets should be distributed across accounts:
   - **Higher Growth Assets (like stocks)** may be better suited to tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - **Bonds** might be better held in taxable accounts as they may be taxed at a lower rate depending on your situation.

5. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market performance.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
