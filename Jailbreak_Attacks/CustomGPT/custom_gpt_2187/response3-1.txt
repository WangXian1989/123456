Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Pre-tax or Roth contributions depending on the plan.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxable investment accounts for more flexible access to funds, but capital gains taxes apply.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, particularly a Roth IRA if you qualify. This can provide tax-free growth.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Balance contributions based on current and future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts may be more beneficial. If you anticipate a higher future tax bracket, consider Roth accounts.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications. Keep income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

### 6. **Consider Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you may need access to funds in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts for more flexibility without penalties.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations across accounts to stay in line with your investment strategy and adjust for market changes.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of salary up to the employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 in 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Fill gaps based on cash flow and investment strategy after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

By strategically distributing your money this way, you can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential while ensuring you meet your financial goals.
