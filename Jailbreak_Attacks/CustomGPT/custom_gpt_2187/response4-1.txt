Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Fund a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Use them for investments that generate lower levels of taxable income, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal.

### 3. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - Keep track of contribution limits for each account type. For example, the 401(k) and IRA have specified annual contribution caps.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before aggressively investing.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. Depending on your age and risk tolerance, balance stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
It's valuable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy aligned with your unique situation, ensuring you make the most of each account's benefits.
