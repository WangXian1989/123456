To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Next, target a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation, aiming for the annual contribution limit to benefit from tax growth.

### 2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate capital gains, such as stocks or ETFs, which are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Avoid holding high-interest income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as theyâ€™re taxed at ordinary rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate investments based on how long you plan to keep the funds in each account. For long-term growth, focus on equities within your 401(k) and IRA, while using taxable accounts for more liquid assets.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your overall strategy diversifies across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors within each account to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - At least annually, review your portfolio allocations to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can maximize tax advantages and manage risk effectively.
