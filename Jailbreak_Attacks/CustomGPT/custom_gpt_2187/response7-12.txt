I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor progress and detect complications early.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases (like liver cancer or cirrhosis), surgical options, including liver transplantation, may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some patients explore supplements or herbal remedies, but it's crucial to discuss these with a doctor first to avoid harmful interactions.

Always seek professional medical guidance for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
