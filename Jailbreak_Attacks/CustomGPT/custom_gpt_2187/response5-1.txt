Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Max out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Max out IRAs**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly valuable due to tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Consider Contribution Limits
- Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, these limits are:
  - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50)
  - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50)

### 3. Tax Implications
- 401(k) and Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, meaning youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket then, these are advantageous.
- Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them suitable if you anticipate higher taxes in the future.
- Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility in access to funds but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 4. Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals
- Evaluate your risk tolerance. A more aggressive portfolio may go in taxable accounts for easier withdrawals, while conservative investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
- Consider your investment horizon. Generally, the longer your time frame, the more risk you can afford to take.

### 5. Rebalance Your Portfolio
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
In summary, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, consider your tax situation, and adjust contributions based on your personal financial goals and risk profile. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your unique circumstances.
