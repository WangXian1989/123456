Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're offered an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out this account if you can.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.

2. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time horizons may allow more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (where growth isnâ€™t taxable until withdrawal).
   - Shorter-term goals may dictate a more conservative approach, especially in taxable accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds, which generate interest income subject to ordinary income tax) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for more liquid investments, or investments meant for short- to mid-term goals. Consider tax-efficient index funds or ETFs since they typically generate fewer taxable events.

5. **Rebalance and Review**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your preferred asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation, ensuring you optimize your tax implications and investment strategy.

By combining these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for long-term growth while minimizing taxes.
