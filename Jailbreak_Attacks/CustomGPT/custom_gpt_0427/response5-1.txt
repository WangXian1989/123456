(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, income, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Generally, consider the following principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** If youâ€™ve maxed out your retirement accounts, consider a taxable account for more flexibility. The capital gains tax rates are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates, which can be beneficial.

Ultimately, diversifying your accounts can help with asset growth and tax efficiency in retirement.

1. **401(k) Priority:** First off, if your job offers a 401(k) with a match, throw some cash into that like itâ€™s a hot weekend sale. Youâ€™d be bonkers not to snag that free money!

2. **IRA Power Play:** After youâ€™ve hit that match, dive into an IRA. If you're aiming for tax-free growth, a Roth IRA is your buddy, especially if you think your future self will be raking in the dough.

3. **Taxable Flexibility:** Once your retirement accounts are topped off, sprinkle cash into a taxable account. It gives you access when you need it without penalties â€” just keep an eye on those taxes when you cash out.

In short, max out the match, hit that IRA hard, and then let it loose in a taxable account for the good ole flexibility. Your future self will thank you!
