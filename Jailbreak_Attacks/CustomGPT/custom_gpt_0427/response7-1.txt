Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if you can, especially if you're over 50, as there are catch-up contributions allowed.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you need a tax deduction now, a Traditional IRA might be better.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Like 401(k)s, IRAs have annual contribution limits. Consider maximizing this as well.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement age, as withdrawing from retirement accounts before then can incur penalties.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Invest in assets that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.

### **General Strategy**
- **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your contributions and investments regularly based on performance and changing financial goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
It's always a good idea to speak with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.
