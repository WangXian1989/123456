Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Prioritize Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can afford to take on more risk with equities since the growth is tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth).
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (such as index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, contributing to a Roth IRA might be better, as you'll pay taxes on contributions at a lower rate.
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket later, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA) might be more advantageous.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts have different tax implications upon withdrawal. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your specific situation.
