Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a simplified breakdown:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k). Some plans have high fees or limited options.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) and a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions). A Roth can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits. For 2024, it’s $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50) for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. They’re great for goals that are shorter-term, such as buying a house or funding education.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Considerations**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund to avoid dipping into retirement accounts.
   - **Debt and Expenses**: Pay down high-interest debt before contributing heavily to retirement accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.

By following a balanced approach and regularly reassessing your distribution as your circumstances change, you can optimize your financial growth and security for the future.
