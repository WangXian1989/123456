To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Determine Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Traditional Accounts:** Funds in a 401(k) or traditional IRA are tax-deferred, making them beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxes or capital gains, such as index funds.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Diversification:**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### Action Steps:
- **Contribute to 401(k):** Start with contributions to receive any employer match.
- **Max out IRA:** If possible, prioritize Roth IRA contributions.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds:** Consider taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity based on your expenses and investment goals.

Evaluate these strategies regularly to adjust for changes in your financial situation or tax laws.
