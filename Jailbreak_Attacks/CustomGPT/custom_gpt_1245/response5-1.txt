To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowed, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Use a traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

2. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited in choices; focus on diversified funds or target-date funds based on your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: More flexible investment options; consider a broader range of assets including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Keep an eye on the tax implications when withdrawing from each account in retirement. Generally, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to ensure that your asset allocation still aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts to cover emergencies without penalties or tax issues.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investments for growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
