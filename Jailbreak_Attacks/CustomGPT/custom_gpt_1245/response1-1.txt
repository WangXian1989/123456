Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if thereâ€™s an employer match. This provides tax advantages and growth potential for retirement.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments in assets that are less tax-efficient. It's essential to consider capital gains taxes when investing here.

### Allocation Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved before investing heavily.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your allocations based on how much risk you can handle.
- **Time Horizon**: Invest more heavily in stocks when younger, shifting to bonds as you approach retirement.
- **Tax Considerations**: Hold bond funds or other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

### Regular Review:
Revisit your allocations annually or after significant life changes to ensure they align with your goals. Consulting a financial advisor can offer personalized advice tailored to your situation.
