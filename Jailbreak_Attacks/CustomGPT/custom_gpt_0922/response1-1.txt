Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it before directing additional funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase. Traditional IRAs may give you an immediate tax deduction.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to your desired limit. This can offer tax-deferred growth as well.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. This provides accessibility for short-term goals but be aware of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual circumstances.
