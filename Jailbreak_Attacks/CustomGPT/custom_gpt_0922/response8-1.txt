Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your IRA and 401(k) first, as they offer tax benefits (traditional accounts may reduce taxable income, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth).

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as income later. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for investments that might generate taxable income (e.g., dividend-paying stocks), taking into account tax-efficiency strategies.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw from each account in retirement. Typically, it might make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, max out if possible.
- **IRA**: Max out traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds.

### User Input:
- What are your current contributions to each account?
- What are your long-term financial goals?
