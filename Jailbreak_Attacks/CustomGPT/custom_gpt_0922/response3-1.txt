Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires a balanced strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Each Account's Purpose**
   - **401(k):** Primarily for retirement savings, often offers employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Another retirement savings vehicle with tax advantages—Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs feature tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible accounts for investments that don’t offer the same tax advantages but allow for more accessible withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income (dividends/capital gains) is taxed in the year it is realized, typically at a lower capital gains tax rate.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer matching—this is essentially "free money."
   - **Fund IRA:** After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA offers greater flexibility in withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Account Investments:** Use these for funds beyond retirement contributions and for shorter-term goals, allowing more liquid access to your money.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate assets depending on your risk profile—stocks for growth in long-term accounts, bonds for stability.
   - **Time Horizon:** Longer horizons (more than 10 years) can afford more aggressive allocations, while shorter horizons might necessitate more conservative approaches.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance, making adjustments as necessary.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out employer match, then contribute up to IRS limits.
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the limit, prioritizing Roth if eligible for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings or funds earmarked for goals within the next 5-10 years.

By taking a structured approach and considering tax advantages, you can create a balanced distribution of your investments that aligns with your retirement and financial goals.
