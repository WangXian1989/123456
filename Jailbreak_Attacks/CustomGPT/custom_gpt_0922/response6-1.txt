Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic way to approach this:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute up to the employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
     - If your budget allows, consider maximizing your contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**:
     - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Use these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or municipal bonds, since these can minimize capital gains.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**:
     - Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities across all accounts.
     - Consider placing higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for when you’ll need to access funds and prioritize withdrawals from accounts based on tax implications. Generally, you want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocation annually or after major life events to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 50% of retirement contributions
- **IRA**: 30% of retirement contributions
- **Taxable Account**: 20% of retirement contributions

### User Input
- What is your current age and retirement timeline?
- What are your financial goals (e.g., buying a house, education savings)?

This approach will help you create a balanced distribution strategy tailored to your individual financial situation.
