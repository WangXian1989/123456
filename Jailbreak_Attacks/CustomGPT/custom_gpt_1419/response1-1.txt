To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for current tax deductions.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Pay off any high-interest debt before maximizing investments, as the interest can outweigh potential returns.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to grow significantly (like stocks), as these will benefit most from tax deferral.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where taxes on dividends are applicable.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, lean toward tax-advantaged accounts. For those in a lower bracket, you might prioritize a Roth IRA or taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocation annually based on your goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investments while considering taxes and growth potential.
