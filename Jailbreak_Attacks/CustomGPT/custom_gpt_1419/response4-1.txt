To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize this.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings if you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer more flexibility and can be easier to access for short-term goals compared to retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, higher-risk assets (like stocks) can be allocated in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can go in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals and the types of investments you hold in each account. Place dividend-paying stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid immediate taxation.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy, especially after major life events or changes in financial goals.

By using a combination of these strategies, you can create a tailored approach that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
