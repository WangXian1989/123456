To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax benefits, depending on your income situation.

### 2. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) that benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Consider placing high-growth assets here, as withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more liquid investments. Consider asset types that generate lower taxable events, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Monitor Performance**: Adjust allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications when rebalance taxable accounts, aiming to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Conclusion
Maintaining a balanced approach while considering tax implications can enhance your overall investment strategy. Regularly review your allocations to align with both market conditions and personal objectives.
