Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your investment growth and minimize your tax burden. Hereâ€™s a systematic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Fund your 401(k) first** to at least the level that gets you the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **If eligible**, contribute to an IRA next. The tax benefits (tax-deferred growth for Traditional IRAs or tax-free growth for Roth IRAs) can provide significant advantages.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Consider your current tax bracket versus what you expect in retirement. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - After meeting the match and funding your IRA, **increase your contributions to your 401(k)** up to the annual limit. This could be particularly effective if your employer offers a good selection of low-fee investment options.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might incur high taxes or for investing funds you may need access to before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) that generate less taxable income.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversify your investments** across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) focusing on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Keep in mind that tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds that generate frequent capital gains) should generally be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. 

### 7. **Professional Guidance**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

### Conclusion
This is a general framework; your ideal distribution may vary based on factors like income, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Always consider your unique financial situation when making investment decisions.
