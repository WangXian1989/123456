Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) and fees associated with it.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: If you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and still want to save, consider a taxable account. This is also useful for goals that are closer in time, as you can access these funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. For instance, withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you’re diversifying your investments across these accounts to manage risk according to your age, risk tolerance, and goals.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changing financial situations and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
