Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth IRAs) since they offer tax advantages.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to shelter them from taxes.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may produce interest income that is taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, Roth IRAs may be more beneficial, as withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - In higher tax brackets, traditional IRAs or 401(k)s can provide upfront tax deductions.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Evaluate Your Retirement Goals**:
   - Consider your retirement timeline. Longer time horizons can afford more risk, while shorter timelines may require stability. 

6. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Itâ€™s often a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
