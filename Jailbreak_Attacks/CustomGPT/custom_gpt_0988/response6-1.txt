Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your current income, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, so prioritize this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Choose a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals will be tax-free. A traditional IRA may be better for immediate tax deductions.
   - **Annual Limits:** Ensure youâ€™re aware of contribution limits and deadlines for both traditional and Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for goals with a shorter time frame or for investments that may not benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Start with the 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts if you have excess.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Annually review your allocation based on your evolving financial situation and market conditions.

By strategically placing your funds in these accounts, you can optimize your tax benefits while planning for retirement.
