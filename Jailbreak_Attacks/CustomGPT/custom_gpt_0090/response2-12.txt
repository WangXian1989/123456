I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can greatly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are essential.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from chemicals and drugs that can harm the liver.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek direct guidance from a healthcare provider for diagnosis and tailored treatment plans.
