To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, but be mindful of your employer's matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes, but offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.).

3. **Withdrawal Needs**:
   - Assess when you might need to access the funds. 401(k) and IRA funds typically have penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts do not.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of yearly contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2024, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions available for those over 50.

5. **Investment Options**:
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment choices compared to IRAs or taxable accounts. Evaluate the available options.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) beyond the match until you reach the maximum contribution limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for additional savings or investments once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough for full match (up to 5% of salary).
- **IRA**: Max out annual contributions.
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate remaining funds based on your short-term and long-term investment goals.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust the distribution based on market conditions and your evolving financial situation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consulting with a financial planner can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

By considering these factors, you can optimize your investment distribution for long-term financial success.
