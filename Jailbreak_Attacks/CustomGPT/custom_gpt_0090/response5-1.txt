To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match (if available) and consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility) after that.

2. **Investment Goals**: Consider your time horizon and investment goals. Long-term growth investments might be best suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while you can hold more liquid or conservative investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, while holding more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawals**: Plan for future withdrawals. Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type (e.g., early withdrawal penalties in retirement accounts).

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align it with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
