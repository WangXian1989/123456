To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Prioritize Taxable Accounts Last:** Since investments in taxable accounts incur taxes on dividends and capital gains, focus on them after maxing out retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure diverse investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

3. **Contribution Levels:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, prioritize contributions up to the match limit.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider a Roth IRA if eligible, for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate a higher tax bracket in retirement.

By balancing these factors, you can create a tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
