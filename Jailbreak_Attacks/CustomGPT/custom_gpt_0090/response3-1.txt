You're looking for the optimal strategy to allocate your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here’s a breakdown to help you make an informed decision:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free” money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which may reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can either defer taxes or withdraw tax-free in retirement.
   - **Investment Choices**: IRAs often offer a wider array of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Capital gains taxes will apply, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Investment**: This can be good for tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-free bonds.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Max out your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Contribute to your IRA (consider a Roth for tax-free growth if eligible).
- Invest any additional savings in your taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Considerations:
- Adjust contributions based on your risk tolerance, retirement timeline, and financial goals.
- Review your investment allocations periodically to ensure they align with your long-term strategy.

This approach balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential while maintaining liquidity.
