Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This gives you flexible withdrawal options without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be aware of capital gains taxes on investments.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution to your specific circumstances.
