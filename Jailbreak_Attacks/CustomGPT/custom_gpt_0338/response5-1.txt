To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If you have a high tax bracket, prioritize contributions here for immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Invest in an IRA or Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Use a traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement; use a Roth if you expect to be in the same or a higher bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These are great for long-term investments, especially if you plan to withdraw money before retirement.

4. **Investment Type:** Consider the tax implications of your investments. Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Review:** Periodically reassess your allocations based on tax law changes, income fluctuations, and retirement goals.

This strategy balances long-term growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
