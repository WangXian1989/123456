Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) based on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: If you still have funds to contribute, continue to max out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility if you have additional funds. This can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, aim for a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance. 

6. **Adjust as Needed**: Reassess your distribution strategy annually, especially after major life changes or shifts in the market.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
