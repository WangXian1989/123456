Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, aim to contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age without penalties. They also allow for more investment options without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free. Keep more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to utilize lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your future withdrawals. Typically, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your distribution strategy annually or after significant life changes to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15% (or enough for the match)
- **IRA**: 10% (or maximum contribution limit)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 75%

Tailor this based on your risk tolerance, age, and financial objectives. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide a personalized approach.
