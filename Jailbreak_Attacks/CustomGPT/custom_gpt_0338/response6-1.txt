Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you'll need in the short term or for tax-efficient investments like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Start with employer matches, then focus on tax-advantaged accounts, and finally allocate to taxable investments as needed.
