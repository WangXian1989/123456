To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - Max out your employerâ€™s 401(k) match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for pre-tax savings; reduce your taxable income now. Ideal for higher-growth investments.
   - **IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower tax rates, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Hold more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If unsure, getting tailored advice based on your specific situation can be beneficial.

This balanced approach maximizes growth potential while minimizing tax impact.
