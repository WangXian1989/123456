Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is effectively free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. These accounts grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes. These are ideal for funds you'll need in the short term.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your allocations mix stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate fund for emergencies; avoid over-allocating to retirement accounts without liquid savings.

5. **Age and Goals**: Adjust your contributions based on age and retirement goals. Typically, younger investors might lean more towards growth investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain desired risk levels.

Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
