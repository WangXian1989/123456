Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 401(k)

- **Max out employer match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
- **Consider contribution limits:** For 2024, the limit is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older.
- **Investment choices:** Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### IRA

- **Choose between Roth and Traditional:** 
  - **Roth IRA:** Contribute post-tax money for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your current taxable income.
- **Contribution limits:** For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50+).

### Taxable Accounts

- **Liquidity needs:** Consider putting money here for short-term goals or emergencies since it's more accessible.
- **Tax-efficient investments:** Focus on long-term investments, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips

1. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts:** Fund your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts.
2. **Rebalance regularly:** Adjust your asset allocation as needed based on market changes and your financial goals.
3. **Consult a financial advisor:** They can provide personalized strategies based on your situation.

It's essential to strategize your contributions based on your priorities and goals to maximize your savings effectively.
