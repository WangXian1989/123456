Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a good match. It reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to traditional accounts reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free in retirement.

4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - Keep more aggressive, higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - Place more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

6. **Consider Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re far from retirement, you can afford to take more risks in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio regularly based on performance and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting a professional.

Balancing contributions among these accounts effectively can maximize growth and minimize taxes over the long term.
