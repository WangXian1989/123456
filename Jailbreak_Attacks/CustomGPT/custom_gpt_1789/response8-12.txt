I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, including reducing alcohol intake and eliminating sugary foods, can help improve liver health.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to address inflammation or infection.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function using blood tests and imaging.

4. **Weight Management**: Losing weight if overweight can significantly improve conditions like fatty liver disease.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from substances that can harm the liver, including certain medications or chemicals.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment plans based on your specific situation.
