The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** If you still have funds available, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in taxable accounts can provide flexibility and access to cash without penalties. Use these accounts for investments that may generate significant capital gains, as they can be more tax-efficient when held long-term.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of the account type, ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and perhaps alternative investments.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type during retirement. Generally, 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free.

7. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

This approach balances tax advantages, employer contributions, and investment growth potential while providing flexibility in your overall financial strategy. It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
