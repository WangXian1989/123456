Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are tax-advantaged (tax-deferred or tax-free in the case of Roth IRAs). Prioritize contributions here, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes and offer less tax efficiency. Use for shorter-term goals or once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Allocate funds across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk. Consider your risk tolerance and retirement timeline when deciding your investments.

### 4. **Base Contributions on Goals**
   - Focus on your retirement needs through tax-advantaged accounts while using taxable accounts for specific short-term goals (like buying a house or funding a major expense).

### 5. **Annual Contribution Limits**
   - Keep an eye on annual contribution limits for 401(k) ($22,500 for 2024) and IRAs ($6,500 for 2024; $7,500 if age 50 or older). Aim to maximize these before contributing to taxable accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional funds, focusing on long-term growth investments to minimize tax implications.

### Summary
The right distribution will be unique to your needs. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that maximizes your money's potential based on your specific circumstances.
