The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, such as a 401(k) and IRA, due to their tax benefits. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments, but be aware of the tax implications for capital gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. For instance, you might choose more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA if you have a long time horizon, while being more conservative in your taxable account.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to ensure that your asset allocation continues to reflect your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best distribution strategy, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy aligns with your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations.
