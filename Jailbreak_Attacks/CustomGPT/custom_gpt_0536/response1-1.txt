Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, investment strategy, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or an IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings growth over time.

3. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure you are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Consider your investment timeline. If you are younger and have a longer time to retirement, you might favor more aggressive investments in your 401(k) or IRA. Conversely, if retirement is near, a more conservative approach may be prudent.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your withdrawals. Generally, funds withdrawn from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

6. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure that you have enough liquidity outside of your retirement accounts for emergencies. Taxable accounts can provide easy access to funds without penalties.

7. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios across all accounts to ensure they align with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
