The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Take advantage of these limits if possible.
   - **Investment Choices**: Review the investment options offered in your 401(k). Choose a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). If you're eligible, max out your IRA contributions.
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of income limits that may affect your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA or deduct contributions to a Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Investment**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account for more flexibility.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, that generate less taxable income.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind that money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them a good option for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and investment types.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, tax implications, and changing financial goals.
   - **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consulting a financial planner can be beneficial.

Ultimately, the allocation depends on your unique financial situation, so itâ€™s essential to assess your goals and seek professional guidance if needed.
