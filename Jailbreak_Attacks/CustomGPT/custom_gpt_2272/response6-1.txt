Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If not, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains (lower tax rates) and qualified dividends. This can help manage your tax burden over time.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on holding higher-growth or higher-yield investments in your 401(k) or IRA, as they will grow without immediate tax implications.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**
   - **Cash Reserves**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a savings or taxable account for liquidity. This typically covers 3-6 months of expenses.

### 4. **Balance Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Younger Investors**: Lean more towards growth (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts due to the longer time frame for growth.
   - **Near Retirement**: Shift towards more conservative investments (bonds) to preserve capital.

### Suggested Allocation Example
- **401(k)**: 40%  
- **IRA**: 30%  
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%  

Adjust percentages based on your specific situation, such as age and retirement timeline. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
