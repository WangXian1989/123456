To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you can consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize funding this account up to the match limit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue Funding 401(k)**: After contributing to an IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps reduce your taxable income and grow your savings tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™re maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices but remember that capital gains and dividends are taxable.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications on withdrawals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investment decisions. Stocks in taxable accounts may lead to capital gains taxes, while bonds may generate taxable interest. It may be beneficial to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation to ensure you are on track to meet your retirement goals and to adapt to any changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or investment performance.

As always, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
