To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions up to the IRS limit, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional savings in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, considering stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about how future tax rates may affect withdrawals from your accounts, especially with tax-deferred accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor your strategy to meet your specific financial goals and circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments across different account types.
