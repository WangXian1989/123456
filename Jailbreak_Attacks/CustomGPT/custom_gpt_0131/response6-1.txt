When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Prioritize contributions to accounts based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with high turnover or that generate taxable income.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Choose different asset classes (stocks, bonds) for each account type to optimize growth and risk.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from each account during retirement to manage tax implications effectively.

By following these guidelines, you can build a more efficient investment strategy.
