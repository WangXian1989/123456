To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that's essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution limit if feasible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Comparison of tax benefits between the two will help determine which is best for you.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in cash or low-risk investments separate from these accounts for unforeseen expenses.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
