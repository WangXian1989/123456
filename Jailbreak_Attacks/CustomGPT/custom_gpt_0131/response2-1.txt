Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if you receive employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals or emergencies. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon (short-term vs. long-term). For longer horizons, consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about when youâ€™ll need access to funds. Taxable accounts are accessible anytime, while retirement accounts impose penalties if withdrawn early.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all account types to manage risk effectively.

5. **Legal Limits and Fees**:
   - Keep an eye on contribution limits for retirement accounts and any fees associated with your investments.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. Max out employer contributions in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax strategy.
3. Invest any additional funds in a taxable account, considering liquidity needs.

### Periodic Review:
Regularly reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change. 

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
