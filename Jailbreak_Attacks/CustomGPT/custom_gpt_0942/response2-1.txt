Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After securing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA can give you a tax deduction upfront, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you have already maxed out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to increase your contributions, up to the IRS limit. The 401(k) might also offer a wider range of investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have excess funds after maxing out retirement accounts, invest in a taxable account for more flexibility. This can be useful for short-term goals and emergency funds since withdrawals are not penalized.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate your investments appropriately across these accounts. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can go into taxable accounts to take advantage of potentially lower capital gains rates.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax efficiency. For taxable accounts, consider using tax-efficient funds or investments that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

7. **Regular Review**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they remain aligned with your objectives.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual situation.
