Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering a few key factors: your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) to benefit from tax-deferred growth and any employer match. 
   - **IRA**: After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA provides tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you’ve taken full advantage of retirement accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that your investment distribution aligns with your financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Think ahead about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can offer flexibility, while tax-deferred accounts may have penalties if accessed early.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can provide valuable insights into optimizing your investment distribution.

Balancing between these accounts can lead to tax efficiency and help you reach your long-term financial goals.
