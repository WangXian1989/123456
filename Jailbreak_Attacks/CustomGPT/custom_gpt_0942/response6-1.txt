Distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k) & IRA (Tax-Advantaged Accounts)**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts to benefit from tax deferral. Contributions may reduce your taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they can be taxed at a lower rate and can offer liquidity.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for short-term goals for easy access. For long-term growth, maximize your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your comfort with risk and market volatility.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed in your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk. This may include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach may look like this:
- **40% in 401(k)**: Max out employer match and focus on growth-oriented investments.
- **30% in IRA**: Roth or traditional depending on your tax situation; focus on assets that may benefit from tax-free growth.
- **30% in Taxable Accounts**: Invest in more liquid assets or for shorter-term goals, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Regularly review your allocation to adjust for changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
