Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match first.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount if possible, especially if you are younger than 50 ($22,500 in 2023, with an additional $7,500 catch-up for those 50+).

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The maximum per year is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50+) for 2023.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use these accounts for short-term savings or investments that you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategies**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a flexible or easily accessible account.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes to manage risk.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Place high-growth or tax-inefficient investments in retirement accounts and more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution based on changing financial circumstances, market conditions, and life goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
