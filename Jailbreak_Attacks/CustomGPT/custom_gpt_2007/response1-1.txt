The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met. Consider your current tax bracket vs. expected future bracket when choosing between the two.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any funds you need access to before retirement. They may not have tax advantages, but you can take advantage of capital gains treatment on long-term investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocation to maintain your desired risk level as market conditions change.

6. **Consider Your Goals**: Your time horizon for different financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home) should influence your allocation strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial expert can tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

It's crucial to regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.
