To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions up front.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for flexibility and liquidity. Invest in tax-efficient funds to reduce tax burdens.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep more stable investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize potential capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, consider withdrawing from taxable and tax-advantaged accounts in a tax-efficient order.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a plan to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and retirement goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
