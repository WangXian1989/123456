Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if feasible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, prioritize contributions here. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you qualify.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, which can be managed for tax efficiency. Consider using tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Each account can hold a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking tax implications into account when selling investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, you might want to shift more into safer investments. In contrast, younger investors typically can take on more risk.

7. **Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of withdrawal rules and tax implications for each account type, particularly for early withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts.
