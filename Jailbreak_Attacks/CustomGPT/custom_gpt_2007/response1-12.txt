I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatments. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options vary depending on the specific liver condition, but common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, engaging in regular exercise, reducing alcohol intake, and avoiding toxins.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Supplements**: Some people use supplements like milk thistle, but it's essential to discuss this with your doctor first.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always prioritize discussing your symptoms and treatment options with a healthcare provider.
