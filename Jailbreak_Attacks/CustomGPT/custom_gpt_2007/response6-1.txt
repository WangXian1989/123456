Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided your income level allows it.

### 2. **Investment Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or municipal bonds. This minimizes tax liability.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on investments that may generate significant capital gains, as they wonâ€™t be taxed until withdrawal.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Spread investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk while aiming for growth.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes, perhaps drawing from taxable accounts first.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts strategically can enhance growth and mitigate taxes over time. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
