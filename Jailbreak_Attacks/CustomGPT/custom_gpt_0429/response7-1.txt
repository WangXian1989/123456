Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you'll need access to the funds. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility and can be accessed without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional), depending on your tax situation and retirement plans.
   - **Maximize 401(k)**: If you still have funds available, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more liquidity and investment flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Distributions from traditional 401(k) and IRAs will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - Withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - Capital gains from taxable accounts are taxed at different rates depending on the holding period.

### 4. **Assess Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments among the accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment timeframe, and overall strategy. Typically, higher-risk assets may be more suitable for long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, while more conservative investments might be better suited for taxable accounts, depending on how soon you plan to access the funds.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
The best distribution will vary based on your individual circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
