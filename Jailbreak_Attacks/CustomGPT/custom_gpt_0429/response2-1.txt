Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep track of annual contribution limits for IRAs. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement or for expenses outside retirement goals. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies (e.g., index funds, tax-loss harvesting) to minimize taxable events.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Prioritize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get your employer match.
- **Focus on IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Direct Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep track of your overall asset allocation and rebalance as needed.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This holistic approach ensures you take advantage of tax benefits while also maintaining flexibility for your future needs.
