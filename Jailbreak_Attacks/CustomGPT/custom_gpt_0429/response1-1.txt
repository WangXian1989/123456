To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

2. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Income Tax**: Distribute into accounts based on your current and expected future tax rates. Contribute to traditional accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) if you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement; opt for Roth accounts if you expect a higher tax rate later.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. Consider using different asset classes in each account type based on tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy from these accounts as you approach retirement to minimize taxes. 

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
