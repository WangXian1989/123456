To effectively allocate your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approaches:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: This is typically tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes on your contributions until you withdraw them in retirement. Make the most of any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t offer tax advantages but can provide flexibility for withdrawals. You’ll owe capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Keep more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts, where you might face regular taxation but can also utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies.

3. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement timeline and needs. Prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA if your focus is on long-term savings.
   - If you're saving for intermediate goals (like buying a home), allocate more to taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure that you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts, as accessing retirement accounts for emergencies can incur penalties.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Make regular contributions to all accounts, but prioritize taking full advantage of any employer match in your 401(k) first before allocating funds to other accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in tax laws, your income, or financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice. They can help tailor a plan that fits your specific situation.
