I'm not a doctor, but general treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery, depending on the specific issue. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They can provide the best guidance based on your individual health needs. If you have any specific symptoms or conditions in mind, I can provide more tailored information.
