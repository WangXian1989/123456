The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Consider contributing up to the annual limit if you can.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but you’ll need to manage capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. 

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing investments that are taxed at lower capital gains rates (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

It’s wise to regularly review your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
