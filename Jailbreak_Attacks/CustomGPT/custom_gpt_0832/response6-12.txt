I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems can vary depending on the specific condition, but some common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid retention in cases of liver cirrhosis.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.
   - Blood tests to check liver enzymes and other markers of liver health.

4. **In severe cases**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be necessary.

Remember, it's essential to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan from a qualified healthcare provider.
