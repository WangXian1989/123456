The distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Consider maxing out your contribution if possible, especially if you are in a high-income bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to your IRA for additional tax-deferred growth. Note the contribution limits and whether you can utilize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Allocate for Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-to-medium-term goals or for funds you may need flexibility with. This account is ideal for investments where you prefer capital gains treatment and have access to funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Assessment**: Riskier investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential higher returns. More stable investments can be placed in taxable accounts, where lower capital gains taxes apply.

4. **Monitor Tax Implications**:
   - **Capital Gains**: Actively manage your taxable investments to minimize short-term capital gains, which are taxed at higher rates.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to optimize your tax bracket.

By utilizing a balanced approach, you can strategically enhance your wealth accumulation while managing risk and tax efficiency. Always stay informed about contribution limits and adjust your strategy based on changes in tax laws.
