When distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free" money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your contributions here first, especially if you have a high-income bracket. 
   - **IRA**: If you can afford it, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred growth**: Both 401(k) and traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Prioritize these for high-yield investments to maximize compound growth.
   - **After-Tax Distributions**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, lean towards Roth contributions or taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk while considering your time horizon and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw from each account in retirement to manage taxes effectively. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or retirement goals.

By focusing on these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to funding your retirement while managing tax implications effectively.
