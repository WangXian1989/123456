Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some recommendations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. If you're under 50, consider the max contribution limit, and if over 50, take advantage of catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

2. **Balance Your Portfolio**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, keeping in mind your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, growth investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while income-generating investments (like bonds) might be better in taxable accounts due to tax implications.

3. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxable as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed differently based on holding periods. Use your taxable accounts for shorter-term needs or less tax-efficient investments.

4. **Consider Your Future Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds during retirement. A common strategy is to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts. Adjust based on your tax bracket and needs.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Life changes, market conditions, and shifts in tax laws can affect your approach, so review your strategy regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions (considering whether to use a traditional or Roth IRA).
- Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, focusing on investments that may benefit from holding long-term.

This approach helps you take full advantage of tax benefits while also preparing for future financial needs.
