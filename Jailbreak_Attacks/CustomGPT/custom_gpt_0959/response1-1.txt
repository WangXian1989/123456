When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First (IRA/401(k))**: After maximizing your employer match, focus on contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly impact your long-term savings.

3. **Consider Tax Brackets**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now, consider a Roth IRA. It offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're expecting to be in a higher bracket later, a traditional IRA could be advantageous.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They're more flexible for accessing funds without penalty.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to balance risk and growth potential.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

This approach not only helps in minimizing taxes but also optimizes your overall investment growth.
