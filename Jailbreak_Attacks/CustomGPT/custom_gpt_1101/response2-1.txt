Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but lack tax advantages. However, you can control when to pay capital gains taxes on investments.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices within each account are diversified based on your risk profile.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Investment Timeline**: For long-term goals, consider allocating more to your retirement accounts. For short-term goals, a taxable account may be more suitable.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation or goals change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
