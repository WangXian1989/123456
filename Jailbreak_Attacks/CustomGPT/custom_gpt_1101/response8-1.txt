To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth; consider high-growth investments.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: If eligible, maximize contributions to an IRA for tax benefits—Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts, such as individual stocks or tax-efficient funds (like index funds).

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts—don’t concentrate risk in one account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from each account, considering tax implications.

6. **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
