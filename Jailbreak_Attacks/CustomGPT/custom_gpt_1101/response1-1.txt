Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match – it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Fill Up the 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed out any matching contributions and potentially your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest, use taxable accounts for more flexible investment options. These can be great for long-term investments, especially if you’ve maxed out retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
