Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your IRA after your 401(k) match, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to sooner, and consider tax-efficient investments like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Balance Your Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about your expected tax bracket in retirement; this can influence whether you prefer tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your circumstances.
