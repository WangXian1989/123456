Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can provide funds without penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Consider Investment Options**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher growth potential and tax implications upon withdrawal.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your investment allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consult with a financial advisor who can consider your unique financial situation.

This strategy helps balance short-term access and long-term growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
