Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** Max out contributions to take advantage of any employer match.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth:** Decide between traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) options based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Investment Choices:** Review your planâ€™s investment options and choose a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA**
   - **Contribution Limits:** Remember the annual contribution limits for IRAs. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible. Choose investments that maximize potential growth, like stocks or mutual funds.
   - **Withdrawals:** Be mindful of penalties for early withdrawals, especially from traditional IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or other investments you might need to access quickly.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or individual stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Location:** Consider holding bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

### General Strategy
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified allocation across all accounts.
- **Rebalance:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on asset performance and changing goals.
- **Consult a Professional:** Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

By strategically allocating your investments across these accounts, you can optimize tax efficiency and align your investments with your long-term financial goals.
