It’s important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Drugs may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures to remove blockages or even a liver transplant might be necessary.
5. **Supplements**: Certain vitamins or herbal supplements can support liver health, but consult your doctor first.

Always follow your healthcare provider’s recommendations for the best outcomes.
