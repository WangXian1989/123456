Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax advantages. Often includes an employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** A tax-advantaged account with contribution limits; traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Standard investment accounts that don’t have the tax benefits of retirement accounts but provide flexibility for withdrawals at any time.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is free money and yields an immediate return on investment.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Max out your IRA contributions. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Exceeding Limits:** If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, contribute to your taxable accounts for more investment opportunities.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Ideal for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) which can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Tax-Free Growth:** Use Roth IRAs for investments expected to appreciate significantly, as withdrawals in retirement will not be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Best for short-term investments or savings you might need soon, as capital gains taxes apply.

### 4. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance:**
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk appetite; stocks for growth in retirement accounts, while bonds may be better suited for more conservative strategies in tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocation across all accounts to ensure they align with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexities of retirement planning, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your individual financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income to take full advantage of the employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (currently $6,000 or $7,000 if over age 50).
- **Taxable Account:** Contribute any additional funds after maxing out the above accounts.

By understanding how each type of account works and finding a balance that suits your financial situation, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively.
