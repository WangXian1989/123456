The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to start.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it next, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can also provide tax deductions, which could be beneficial depending on your income.
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you're in a high tax bracket and can benefit from the tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals, which can be useful if you need access to funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: 
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, as they generate fewer taxable events.
   - **High-Growth Investments**: Keep higher-growth investments (which may generate significant capital gains) and bonds (which generate interest) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all account types to mitigate risk and optimize returns.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawals from these accounts as you approach retirement age to minimize taxes owed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy tailored to your individual financial situation.

It's important to review and adjust your strategy regularly based on changes in your financial goals or tax laws.
