Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional), depending on your income level and tax strategy. IRAs often have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) accounts.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: Once you've funded your IRA, direct additional contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows you to save more for retirement while reducing your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may have higher turnover rates or if you need flexibility for short-term goals. Consider investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Evaluate your current and expected future tax rates to decide on the balance between pre-tax (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) contributions. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and that your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation, especially as your financial situation and goals evolve. Adjust your contributions and investments as necessary.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
