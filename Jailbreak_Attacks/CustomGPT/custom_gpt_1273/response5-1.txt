The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to maximize this benefit. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if your employer does not provide a match or if you're focused on higher contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and liquidity, especially for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs and situation.
