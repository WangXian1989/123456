To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. This allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially beneficial if you expect higher tax rates in the future.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This also gives you the benefit of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts. This can provide flexibility, liquidity, and access to capital without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider different investment strategies for each account type based on tax implications.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and your financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your individual circumstances.
