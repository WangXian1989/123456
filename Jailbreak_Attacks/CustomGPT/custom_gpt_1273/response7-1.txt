Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts if you want flexibility for early withdrawals or need the funds for shorter-term goals.

4. **Balance Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts, making sure to consider tax implications. Stocks may go in taxable accounts for better long-term capital gains treatment, while bonds might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regularly Reassess**: Periodically review your portfolio to adjust based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, or market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
