Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Pay Down Debt**: Consider using some funds to pay down high-interest debt if applicable, as this offers a guaranteed return on investment.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. This may involve more flexibility in investment choices.

5. **Investment Allocation**: Keep your asset allocation in mind. Generally, stocks are suitable for long-term growth (in tax-advantaged accounts), while bonds and more conservative investments can align well with taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is often beneficial, based on your specific goals and financial situation.
