When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deductible contributions, but also consider the income limits for deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer matches in your 401(k) first.
   - Contribute to IRAs (traditional or Roth) up to the annual limit.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For retirement (long-term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - For shorter-term goals, consider using a taxable account for greater liquidity.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Diversify investments in both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals considering tax implications. Longer-term accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs generally should be tapped later than taxable accounts to defer taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max out employer match first.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to maximize tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional investments and to maintain liquidity.

Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
