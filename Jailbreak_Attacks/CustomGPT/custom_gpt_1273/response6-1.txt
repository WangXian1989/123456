To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Prioritize Based on Tax Treatment**
   - **High Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place assets expected to appreciate significantly, like stocks, in your tax-deferred accounts to avoid immediate taxation.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Consider keeping lower-growth, more stable investments, like bonds, in your taxable accounts to manage tax impacts efficiently.

### 3. **Tactical Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust the mix of stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and how long you plan to invest before needing the funds.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your portfolio aligns with your evolving financial goals, adjusting contributions as needed.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Tax-Strategic Withdrawals**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax implications, prioritizing accounts based on tax liabilities.

By utilizing this approach, you can optimize your investments and potentially enhance your long-term financial growth.
