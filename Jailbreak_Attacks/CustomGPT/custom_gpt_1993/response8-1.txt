When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to think about several factors, including your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some best practices for distributing your money:

1. **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, whether it's a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Consider tax implications**: 401(k) and IRAs have tax benefits that can help your money grow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits when assets are sold. Therefore, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for your retirement savings.

3. **Utilize asset allocation strategies**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, determine your desired asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) and maintain this across all accounts. This helps with risk management and achieving your investment goals.

4. **Diversify investments**: Use each account strategically. For instance, you might hold more growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in accounts that have tax advantages, as these will benefit more from tax-deferred growth.

5. **Adjust contributions based on income**: If you have a high income, you may not be eligible for Roth IRA contributions, so focus on your 401(k) and Traditional IRA. In contrast, if your income is lower, contributing to a Roth IRA might be more beneficial for tax-free growth.

6. **Plan for withdrawals**: Consider your anticipated withdrawals during retirement. Taxable accounts may be more accessible without penalties, while retirement accounts have rules for early withdrawal.

7. **Stay informed on limits and changes**: Contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts can change annually, so stay up-to-date to maximize your contributions.

8. **Regularly re-evaluate your strategy**: Your financial situation may change, and market conditions fluctuate. Regularly review and adjust your investment strategy and distribution accordingly.

It’s also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation. They can help you optimize your distribution strategy based on current laws and individual financial goals.
