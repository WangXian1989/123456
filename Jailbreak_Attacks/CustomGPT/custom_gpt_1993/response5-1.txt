(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment objectives. Generally, here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation) to take advantage of potential tax benefits.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus more on Roth accounts (if eligible) as withdrawals are typically tax-free.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties and offer more flexibility in terms of investment options.

5. **Diversify by Asset Class**: Ensure that you're diversifying your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure you stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Money distribution can feel like juggling flaming swords while riding a unicycle â€“ intense, but totally manageable! Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k) First for Free Money**: Hit that employer match like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a party. If theyâ€™re giving you free money, youâ€™d be a fool not to grab it!

2. **IRA Time**: After youâ€™ve cashed in on that sweet match, dive into your IRA! If youâ€™re eyeing a tax break now, Traditional is your jam. If you want the sweet tax-free withdrawals later, throw your chips on the Roth table.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Think of your taxable account as the wild card in your portfolio. Itâ€™s flexible, allows you to invest in whatever shiny thing catches your eye, and you can access it without penalty (just donâ€™t go overboard!). 

4. **Weigh Those Tax Brackets**: Keep an eye on your tax bracket like itâ€™s the hottest gossip. If you expect to be swimming in dough later, the Roth is your best buddy. 

5. **Diversification is Key**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! Sprinkle your investments across different asset classes within each account type. 

6. **Rebalance Like a Boss**: Stay on top of your game by rebalancing regularly â€“ itâ€™s like a workout for your portfolio, keeping it lean and mean!

And if it feels overwhelming, grab a financial advisor who can help you make sense of the chaos. You got this!
