The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
- **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)). Consider how this aligns with your tax situation.
- **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Roth may be better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Diversity of Investments**: IRAs often allow a broader array of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them a good place for short-term savings or investment goals.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Holding investments long-term can reduce your tax liability.

### General Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions** to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** if eligible, especially if you can benefit from tax advantages.
3. **Use taxable accounts** for additional savings and investments, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### Example Approach:
- **Age & Time Horizon**: Younger investors may lean more heavily into stocks, while those nearing retirement should consider more bonds and conservative investments.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Higher risk tolerance may favor higher allocations in growth-oriented accounts (like a 401(k)).
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they still align with your goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all answer. Assess your unique situation, including your employment benefits, income, and future needs. Consulting with a financial advisor may provide tailored advice to optimize your specific distribution strategy.
