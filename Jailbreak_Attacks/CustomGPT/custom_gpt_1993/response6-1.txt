To optimize your investment distribution, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, especially if it offers tax benefits (traditional vs. Roth).

2. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Tax Treatment**:
   - Place investments with the highest expected growth in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate interest or dividends to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

**Additional Tips**:
- Regularly re-evaluate your asset allocation based on changing financial goals and market conditions.
- Consider the impact of withdrawal strategies in retirement, as different accounts have varying tax implications.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
