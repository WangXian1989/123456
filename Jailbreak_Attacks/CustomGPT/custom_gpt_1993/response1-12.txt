I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're dealing with liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications and therapies might be necessary depending on the specific liver condition. It's best to get personalized advice from a medical expert.
