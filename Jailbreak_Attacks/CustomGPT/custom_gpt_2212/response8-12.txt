I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best course of action for liver problems often involves consulting a healthcare professional. They may recommend treatments such as lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in some cases, procedures if necessary. It's crucial to follow a doctor's advice tailored specifically to your condition. If you have more specific information about your liver problem, I might be able to provide more targeted general information.
