To provide you with the best advice on distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider a few key factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money and a key part of your retirement planning.

2. **Take Advantage of Tax Benefits**: Contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Traditional IRAs may give you a tax break now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth**: Allocate your investments based on how much risk you’re willing to tolerate. Generally, younger individuals can afford to take more risks for greater growth potential, while those closer to retirement may want to shift towards more stable, income-generating investments.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments in taxable accounts might be more suitable for short-term goals since they don't have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. Focus on investing for growth in tax-advantaged accounts and consider holding more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your investment strategy should evolve as your financial situation and life circumstances change. Regularly reviewing your distribution and making adjustments can keep you on track to meet your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure or have a complicated financial situation, consulting a financial advisor can help create a tailored strategy that considers all aspects of your financial landscape.
