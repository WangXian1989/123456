It's great that you're thinking strategically about how to allocate your money among different types of accounts. Here are some tips to consider when distributing your funds:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA (both traditional and Roth, if eligible) before investing in taxable accounts, due to their tax advantages.

2. **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Choices**: Invest for growth in tax-advantage accounts. Consider placing higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts and bonds in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on more stable returns.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a more liquid account before maximizing investments. Covering 3-6 months of expenses is generally recommended.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify your investments across all account types according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. This can help you manage risk while working toward growth.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in income, life events, and investment performance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best approach for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial goals.

Each personâ€™s situation is unique, so tailor your strategy to fit your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
