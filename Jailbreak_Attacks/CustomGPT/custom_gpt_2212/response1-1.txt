The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting extra funds in a taxable account. These accounts provide more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account. For example, traditional 401(k) and IRA funds are taxed as income upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts are tax-free.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk, regardless of the account type.

6. **Plan for Retirement**: As you approach retirement, analyze your asset allocation, shifting more towards income-generating investments and less volatile options.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also guide you in creating a personalized strategy based on your unique situation.
