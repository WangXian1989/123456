(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a balanced approach includes maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matching, then funding your IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth. After maximizing these, you can consider taxable accounts for more flexible access to your investments. It's important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! Your 401(k) is like that reliable friend who's always there to help you out with a matching contributionâ€”so definitely max that out first if your employer offers it. Then, swing over to your IRA; itâ€™s like a tax-deferred magic vault for your retirement funds. After youâ€™ve squeezed every penny out of those, throw your spare cash into a taxable account. This way, you get a mix of tax benefits and liquidity. Just keep an eye on capital gains over there! And hey, donâ€™t forget to keep your overall goals in sight; youâ€™re building wealth, not just tossing money around like confetti! ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’¸
