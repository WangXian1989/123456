I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to speak with a healthcare professional about liver problems. They can provide you with tailored advice based on your specific condition. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the nature of the liver issue, such as lifestyle changes, medication, or more specialized medical interventions. Always consult with your doctor for the best information and guidance.
