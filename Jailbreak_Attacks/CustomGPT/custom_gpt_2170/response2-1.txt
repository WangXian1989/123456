To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Benefits**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Generally, contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA can lower your taxable income, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

3. **Balance Investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you may want to place aggressive growth investments in your taxable accounts, where capital gains are taxed, and hold more stable investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Rules**: Understand the withdrawal rules associated with each account. If you might need access to your money before retirement, keep a portion in your taxable account for flexibility.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Regularly assess your account allocations to ensure they align with your overall financial goals and make adjustments as needed.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your portfolio is diversified across asset classes, regardless of account type. This can help manage risk while aiming for growth.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure of the best distribution strategy for your specific situation, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
