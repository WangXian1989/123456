The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but being taxed upon withdrawal. This is usually a good option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible now (Traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth). Choose based on your current and anticipated future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility but may have tax implications due to capital gains and dividend taxes. Use these for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Allocate funds based on your time horizon. Generally, the longer the time frame until you need the funds, the more aggressive you might be in your investment strategy, particularly in retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance, changes in financial goals, or new tax laws.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice specific to your circumstances, consider consulting with a financial advisor to optimize your distribution strategy.
