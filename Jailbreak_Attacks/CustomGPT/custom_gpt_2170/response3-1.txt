Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k)s and IRAs allow your investments to grow tax-deferred. Contributing to these accounts can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. However, they can offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. It's usually best to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

3. **Diversify Contributions Based on Age and Goals**:
   - **Younger Investors**: Often benefit from maxing out Roth IRAs if eligible, as they can enjoy tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 
   - **Older Investors**: May lean more heavily on tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs to reduce current taxable income.

4. **Account Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - **During Retirement**: You may want to withdraw from your taxable accounts first to minimize taxes on tax-deferred accounts, allowing those balances to continue growing. 

5. **Adjust for Investment Choices and Risk**:
   - Your risk tolerance should influence how you allocate investments within each account type. Typically, you may want higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts where gains are tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth accounts).

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Given the complexities involved in tax regulations and investment strategies, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial planner who can tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By assessing your current financial status, retirement goals, and risks tolerances, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term objectives.
