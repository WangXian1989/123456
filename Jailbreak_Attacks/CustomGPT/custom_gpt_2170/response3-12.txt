2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, some medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests to keep track of liver health.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, especially for liver tumors or severe liver diseases.
