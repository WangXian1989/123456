The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment preferences. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: 401(k) plans have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, so consider maxing out your contributions if possible, especially if you're in a higher income bracket.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (taxed contributions but tax-free withdrawals), your strategy will differ.
   - **Investment Options**: IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options than employer-sponsored plans, which could allow for better diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts are accessible without penalties, making them suitable for shorter-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough in an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match.
- **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Investments**: After maxing out retirement accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable account, focusing on long-term investments to minimize taxes.

### Example Distribution
Consider this general approach based on a hypothetical income and savings goal:
- **401(k)**: 50% of monthly contributions (up to employer match)
- **IRA**: 25% of monthly contributions
- **Taxable Account**: 25% of monthly contributions

Ultimately, it could be beneficial to consult a financial adviser to tailor a strategy based on your unique situation and goals.
