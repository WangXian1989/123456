To develop a sound strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Assess Tax Implications**: 
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are often tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s let you pay taxes upfront, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts involve capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - If you can, also max out contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your current income level and tax situation.

3. **Consider Your Retirement Goals and Timeline**: 
   - If retirement is many years away, consider being more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts, investing in potentially higher-growth assets.
   - As retirement approaches, gradually shift to more conservative investments, especially in your taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments are balanced across different types of accounts, not just in one type. This can help optimize your overall tax situation and investment growth.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Keep a portion in liquid resources (taxable accounts) for emergencies, so you're not forced to withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts during a financial crunch.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds during retirement. Tax considerations may dictate which accounts to withdraw from first. Generally, it may make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roths.

7. **Regular Review**: 
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.
