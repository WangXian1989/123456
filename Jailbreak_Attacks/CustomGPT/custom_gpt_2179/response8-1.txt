Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match and contributing to an IRA, return to your 401(k) to maximize contributions. 

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for holding assets that generate more favorable long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding between traditional and Roth accounts. 

### 7. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on your goals, risk tolerance, and changes in income.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to your investments.
