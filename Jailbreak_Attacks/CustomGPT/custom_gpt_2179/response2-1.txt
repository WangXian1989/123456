To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing taxable income now but leading to taxable withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but incur taxes on dividends and capital gains. Use this account for investments that generate lower turnover.

### 3. **Investment Horizons**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in accounts that benefit from tax-advantaged growth, like your 401(k) and IRAs.
   - Use your taxable account for conservative investments or shorter-term goals due to tax implications on gains.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversification helps mitigate risks.

### 5. **Rebalance Portfolio**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level, especially after major market fluctuations.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy based on your retirement goals, tax situation, and overall financial health.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of salary until matching is maxed, then adjust as needed.
- **IRA**: Contribute max annual limit if eligible, prioritize Roth for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest surplus after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Focus on maximizing employer matches and tax advantages while ensuring a diversified portfolio that aligns with your financial goals. Regularly reassess and adjust based on your evolving needs and market conditions.
