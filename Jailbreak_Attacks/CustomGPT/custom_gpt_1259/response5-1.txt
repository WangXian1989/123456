When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible. This can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency in Investments**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds and ETFs. Avoid holding high-turnover funds or bonds here due to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Across all accounts, maintain a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals**
   - In retirement, determine which accounts to withdraw from first based on tax implications. Generally, itâ€™s wise to draw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
