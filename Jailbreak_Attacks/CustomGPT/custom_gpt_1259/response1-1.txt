Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure to have sufficient liquid savings for emergencies before heavy investments.

5. **Balanced Approach**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Stocks are generally better for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changing financial circumstances or retirement goals.
