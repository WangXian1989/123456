The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income level, tax situation, financial goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline to help you consider the distribution:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older). Allocate your funds to take full advantage of this limit if possible.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Decide if you want to contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The best choice depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit for an IRA is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older). Maximize contributions particularly to a Roth IRA if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Growth**: Invest any money that exceeds your retirement account limits or that you might need access to before retirement. Taxable accounts allow for liquidity and flexibility with investments.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

**Sample Distribution Strategy**:
- **Age 20-40**: Prioritize maximizing the 401(k) to get the employer match, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, and use taxable accounts for any additional funds or short-term savings.
- **Age 40-60**: Continue prioritizing the 401(k) and IRA contributions while considering the tax implications. Start focusing on a balanced approach with taxable accounts for potential early retirement needs.
- **Age 60 and Above**: Shift focus towards income generation. Ensure that your asset allocation reflects a reduced risk profile as you approach retirement.

**Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
Consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to consider your specific situation, particularly regarding tax implications of withdrawals, investment gains, and your overall retirement strategy. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals while maximizing your retirement savings.
