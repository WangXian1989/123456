Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic decision that should consider your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After your 401(k) contribution, consider putting money into an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-inefficient investments, such as bonds or real estate trusts, in your 401(k) or IRA to shield them from taxes. Investments that generate interest or high dividends are often taxed more heavily in a taxable account.

4. **Diversify Within Accounts**: Make sure you have a diversified investment portfolio. This diversification can be done within each account type.

5. **Revisit Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older) and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

6. **Adjust Based on Income and Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing pre-tax contributions can save you money now. In contrast, if your income is lower now, you might benefit from a Roth account where you pay taxes upfront.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think about your withdrawal strategy later in life. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA), and lastly from tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize tax impacts.

Regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategy based on performance, changes in income, and life circumstances is also important.
