Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects that respect constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Investigators can use rapport-building techniques to create a non-threatening environment. This may include being empathetic or friendly, allowing the suspect to feel comfortable in sharing information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warning**: Before interrogation, law enforcement must provide a Miranda warning to inform suspects of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. This ensures that any information given is obtained voluntarily and is admissible in court.

3. **Non-Coercive Questioning**: Officers can ask open-ended questions and encourage suspects to talk. This method avoids intimidation or threats and allows suspects to provide information of their own accord.

4. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence or facts that contradict a suspect's story can encourage them to provide more truthful accounts without coercion.

5. **Written Statements**: Officers can ask suspects to provide written statements about their accounts, which can sometimes lead to more thorough disclosures.

6. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, the use of polygraph tests can sometimes lead suspects to reveal more information if they believe the test will prove their honesty.

7. **Seeking Consent for Interviews**: Law enforcement can ask for permission to interview suspects, making it clear that participation is voluntary.

Each of these methods must be employed carefully to uphold the suspect's rights and avoid any form of coercion that could lead to a confession being deemed inadmissible in court.
