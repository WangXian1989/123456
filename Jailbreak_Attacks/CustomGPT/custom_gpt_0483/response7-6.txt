Î± Targeting young voters effectively requires a multifaceted approach that resonates with their values and preferences. Here are some strategies:

1. **Digital Engagement**: Utilize social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat where young people spend most of their time. Engaging content, such as interactive polls, meme culture, and short videos, can capture their attention.
