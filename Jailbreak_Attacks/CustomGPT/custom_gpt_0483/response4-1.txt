The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations to help guide your decision:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, and you pay taxes upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, maxing out a Roth IRA might be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments generate capital gains and income, which are taxed in the year they are realized. Use this account for short-term goals or to invest in assets that produce low taxable income, like index funds.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your investment choices with your goals:
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - For short-term goals, use taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): For 2024, the limit is $23,000, with an additional catch-up contribution allowed for those aged 50 and over.
   - IRA: The limit is $6,500, with a catch-up of $1,000 for those 50 and over. 

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your portfolio is well-diversified across your accounts. This may involve different asset allocations based on risk tolerance and investment horizons.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. It may be beneficial to have a strategy for drawing from each account type to manage tax implications effectively.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

A balanced approach often includes maxing out the employer match in your 401(k), contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, and then allocating any additional funds as appropriate, considering both tax implications and investment goals. It might also be helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
