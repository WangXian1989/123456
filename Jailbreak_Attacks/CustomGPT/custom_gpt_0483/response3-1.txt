The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy you can consider:

1. **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is effectively "free money."

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After securing your employer match, consider maximizing contributions to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your eligibility, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Balance with Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in a taxable account. This can offer flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties at any time, but keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Consider Investment Types**:
   - For tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks or mutual funds) that benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - For taxable accounts, you might want to focus on investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds, and consider holding them for the long term to mitigate capital gains taxes.

5. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly**: Review your allocation annually or after significant life changes (like a salary increase, lifestyle change, or market shifts) to ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, seeking advice from a financial planner can help tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific circumstances.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a diversified approach that supports your retirement goals while considering tax efficiency.
