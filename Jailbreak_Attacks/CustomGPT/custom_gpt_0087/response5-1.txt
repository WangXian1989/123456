Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute to your 401(k) at least enough to get any available employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit if you haven't reached it yet.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for more accessible funds, which you can withdraw without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
