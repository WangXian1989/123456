To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Focus on maxing out contributions to take advantage of employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax. Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term gains.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if 50+ for 2023).
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50+ for 2023).

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments across account types:
     - Higher growth investments (like stocks) can be favored in tax-deferred accounts.
     - Consider holding bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable tax rates.

### 5. **Consult a Professional**
   - A financial advisor can tailor a strategy to your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions (especially if matching).
2. Contribute to an IRA, choosing between Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional investments and liquidity needs.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation and tax laws change.
