Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get employer match if available; it's free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions in a Roth or Traditional IRA based on eligibility.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement; ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - If you're younger, consider more aggressive investments (stocks) in all accounts for long-term growth.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments (bonds).

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some funds in a taxable account for unexpected expenses, as IRAs and 401(k)s typically have penalties for early withdrawal.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to reduce risk.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%

### Periodic Review
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and life events.
