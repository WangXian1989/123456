Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your income, tax situation, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth is generally better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments. Capital gains and dividends are taxed at different rates than ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.

### 3. **Consider Investment Horizons**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of growth without immediate tax implications.
   - **Bonds/Income**: Consider placing income-generating assets in taxable accounts if they are in lower tax brackets.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% (up to match)
- **IRA**: 10% (max contribution)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining amount, focusing on diversification.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your unique situation and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
