Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim for the maximum annual contribution if possible.
   - **IRA**: Fund a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for investment goals that are shorter-term or if youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, focusing on Roth contributions may be beneficial. Conversely, if you anticipate a lower tax rate, traditional accounts might be preferable.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Summary
A common approach is to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts. Customize this strategy based on your personal financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.
