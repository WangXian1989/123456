Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**

- **401(k)**: 
  - Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
  - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if your budget allows.

- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
  - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for potential tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA can offer tax deductions now.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situations**

- **Taxable Accounts**: 
  - Use these for funds you may need before retirement or if you might exceed contribution limits on tax-advantaged accounts.
  - Investments in taxable accounts can be more tax-efficient (consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains rates).

### 3. **Keep an Eye on Investment Options**

- Assess the investment choices available in each account type. Sometimes, employer-sponsored 401(k) plans may have limited options compared to IRAs.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**

- Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk effectively. 

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**

- Periodically adjust your investment distribution to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Sample Distribution Strategy

- **401(k)**: 15% of your overall portfolio.
- **IRA**: 10%.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 5%.
- Adjust based on your specific goals, tax situation, and future needs.

### Conclusion

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your financial situation and goals.
