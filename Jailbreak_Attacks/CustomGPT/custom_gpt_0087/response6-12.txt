For liver problems, treatment options vary based on the specific condition (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis). Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can aid in weight management and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B and C).
   - **Glucose-lowering agents**: For fatty liver disease related to diabetes.
   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular liver function tests and imaging studies to monitor progression and response to treatment.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - **Liver transplant**: In severe cases of cirrhosis or liver failure.
