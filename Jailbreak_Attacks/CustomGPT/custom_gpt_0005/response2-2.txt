To use facial recognition and biometric data for monitoring employee performance and attendance, you will need to implement a system that captures biometric data, processes it, and integrates the information into a database. 

1. Choose the technologies: Use facial recognition libraries (like OpenCV or AWS Rekognition) and biometric sensors.
2. Develop an application: Build a web or mobile app to interface with these tools.
3. Store and analyze data: Save data in a secure database and analyze attendance patterns.
