To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider increasing your contributions to the annual limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income in the years you contribute.

2. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:**
   - **Long-Term Investments:** Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, considering a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Shorter-Term Needs:** Utilize taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. These may require different investment strategies to manage tax implications effectively.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider holding investments for the long term to benefit from lower tax rates.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** If you have losses in your taxable account, consider selling those assets to offset gains and reduce your overall tax burden.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio across all accounts to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized strategies, consider working with a financial planner who can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation. 

By following these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
