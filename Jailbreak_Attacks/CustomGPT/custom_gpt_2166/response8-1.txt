The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and is a great way to start.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth IRAs). Aim to maximize contributions to these accounts before contributing to taxable accounts, particularly if you are in a high tax bracket.
   - **Taxable accounts**: These should generally hold investments that may generate taxable events (like bonds or actively managed funds), as you will pay capital gains tax on the growth and interest income.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well diversified. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and then Roth accounts (since those can grow tax-free for as long as you donâ€™t withdraw).

5. **Consult a Professional**: It can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, including your current financial status, age, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. It's important to regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as your life circumstances change.
