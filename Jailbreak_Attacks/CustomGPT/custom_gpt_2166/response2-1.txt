To create an effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or building wealth?

2. **Understand the Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal, which can benefit long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, but contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s. You can choose between traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (taxed upfront) IRAs based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for more flexibility concerning withdrawals and investing but do not provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

3. **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money. Then, consider funding an IRA to take advantage of its tax benefits.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for investments expected to grow significantly, as this will maximize tax efficiency.
   - Consider holding lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens since interest income is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your evolving goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
