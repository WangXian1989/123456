Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Generally, it's advisable to contribute to your 401(k) and IRA before funding a taxable account since these accounts provide tax benefits. If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider contribution limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for IRAs and 401(k)s (as of 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500, and for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500, with catch-up contributions available for those over 50). Once you've maximized these contributions, you can invest in a taxable account.

3. **Asset allocation**: Think about how to allocate your investments among these accounts. Generally, it's most tax-efficient to hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding stocks, which typically have long-term capital gains treatment, in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy carefully. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, which may influence how much you need in taxable accounts.

5. **Investing goals**: Your distribution may also depend on your short-term and long-term goals. For instance, if you need funds in the next few years, you may want to keep more liquidity in taxable accounts.

By evaluating these factors, you can develop a strategy that aligns with your overall financial plan. Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice that accounts for your specific circumstances.
