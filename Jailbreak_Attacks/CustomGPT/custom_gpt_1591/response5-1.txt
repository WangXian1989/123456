Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a diversified mix of assets within your 401(k), typically including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that align with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**
   - **Type Matters**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it's often advantageous due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute the maximum allowed each year, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket currently.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for investments that may not fit into tax-advantaged accounts, like stocks for long-term capital gains.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and strategies (such as holding investments long-term to minimize capital gains taxes).

### **General Recommendations**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside outside these accounts for emergencies.
- **Age Considerations**: Younger investors might lean towards aggressive investments, while those nearing retirement may prefer more conservative holdings.
  
### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
It's often beneficial to consult a financial planner to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific financial landscape.
