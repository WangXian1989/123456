The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies you could consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Investment Choices:**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Keep higher yielding or less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Diversity:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce overall risk.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - In higher tax brackets, favoring pre-tax contributions (401(k) and Traditional IRA) can provide immediate tax relief.
   - If you're in a lower bracket, a Roth IRA may be more advantageous since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Regular Reevaluation:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and account performance to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Example of Distribution:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize employer match.
- **IRA:** Fully fund (Roth or Traditional based on your tax strategy).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest remaining funds, focusing on tax-efficient options.

### Conclusion:
Thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all answer, so consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a specific plan to your situation.
