To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s free money.
   - **Choose Appropriate Investments**: Focus on growth-oriented funds or options if you have a long time horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions if your income is lower. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, your investments grow tax-free, making it beneficial for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Diversified Investments**: Prioritize investments that may be more tax-efficient or require longer time to appreciate, such as stocks or mutual funds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Choose investments that minimize tax implications—index funds and ETFs typically distribute fewer taxable gains.
   - **Withhold Short-Term Gains**: Avoid frequent trading to minimize short-term capital gains taxes.

### Allocation Based on Goals:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses set aside.
- **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Allocate more to retirement accounts for long-term growth, while using taxable accounts for short-term needs or goals.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to market performance and life changes, ensuring alignment with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- For personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation, goals, and investment options, consider consulting with a financial advisor. 

This balanced approach can maximize growth while also managing tax implications effectively over time.
