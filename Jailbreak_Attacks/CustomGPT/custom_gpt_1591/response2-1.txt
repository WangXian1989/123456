Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is “free money.”
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as taxes are lower on long-term gains.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Hold higher-growth, higher-tax assets like stocks or mutual funds here to defer taxes.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for compounding growth.
   - For short-term goals, use taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - In lower brackets, consider Roth options for future tax-free income.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type.

### Sample Allocation
- **401(k):** 15-20% of gross income (max for match)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA:** Up to annual limit
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder after maxing tax-advantaged accounts

### 6. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations based on performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

### Final Considerations
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications.
