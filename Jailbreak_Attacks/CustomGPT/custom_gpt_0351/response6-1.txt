To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if there's an employer match. This reduces taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments taxed at lower rates (like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains).

### 2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity; they allow for easier access to funds.

### 3. **Account Balancing**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Example Breakdown:
- **401(k)**: 40% (max out up to the employer match if possible)
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

### Key Considerations:
- Review fees and expense ratios.
- Rebalance regularly based on performance and changing goals.

By strategically using each account type, you can optimize your tax efficiency and align your investments with your financial goals.
