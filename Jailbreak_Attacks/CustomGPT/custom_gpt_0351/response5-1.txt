Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Pay off high-interest debts before heavily investing. 

4. **Diversify Investments**: Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for money you'll need before retirement or to take advantage of tax-loss harvesting.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust contributions based on your life changes and financial goals.

Overall, a balanced approach tailored to your circumstances is key. It's often wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
