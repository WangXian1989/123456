To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize this up to the match limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments for your taxable accounts, such as index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts when possible.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Adjust contributions based on your current and expected future tax rates. Contribute to which accounts offer the most tax benefit at your current income level.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, allocate your assets according to your risk tolerance and financial goals. Adjust contributions to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can optimize your strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy as income, goals, and tax laws change.
