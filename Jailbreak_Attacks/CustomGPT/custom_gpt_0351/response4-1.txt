Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Tax-advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your income level.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term Needs**: Funds in taxable accounts may be more accessible without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Bracket Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts to lock in tax-free growth.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need before retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Regularly review your contributions and investment performance to adjust your strategy as needed.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
