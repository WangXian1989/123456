I'm not a doctor, but if you have liver issues, common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet adjustments, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications can be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Specialized Treatment**: If you have hepatitis or cirrhosis, targeted treatments may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
