Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider when allocating funds across these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of the match before allocating money to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, as they can offer tax benefits. Consider contributing the maximum allowed to your IRA if eligible, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: Assess your current and expected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) may be beneficial, allowing you to defer taxes until withdrawal. Conversely, if you anticipate a higher tax rate, a Roth IRA could be advantageous.

4. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: A mix of account types can provide tax diversification. This means having some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility, as well as tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Evaluate Fees and Investment Options**: Compare the fees and investment options available in your 401(k) plan versus an IRA or taxable account. High fees can erode your returns, so consider low-cost investment options, such as index funds or ETFs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you allocate your investments, continue to monitor and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation and investment strategy.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Your age and how far you are from retirement can affect your investment strategy. Younger investors might benefit from more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to preserve capital.

Ultimately, the best distribution for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will be unique to your situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.
