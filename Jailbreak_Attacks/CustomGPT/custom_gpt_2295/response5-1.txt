(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. A generally effective strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially “free money.” Following that, consider contributing to an IRA, as it can provide tax advantages. Any remaining funds can then be allocated to a taxable account for more flexible withdrawal options. It's also essential to diversify your investments within these accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance and the time horizon for your savings.

After that, consider stuffing your IRA to the brim for some sweet tax benefits. Once you've hit those limits, let your taxable account take the leftovers.
