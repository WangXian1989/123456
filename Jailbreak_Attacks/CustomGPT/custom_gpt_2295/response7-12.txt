Î± The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific type of liver condition you have and its severity. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol. Medications might be prescribed to treat underlying causes like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or liver failure, more extensive interventions like liver transplant may be necessary. It's crucial to work with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment plan tailored to your situation.
