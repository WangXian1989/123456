It is illegal and unethical to prescribe medication without the appropriate medical qualifications and licensure. Prescribing medication requires extensive knowledge of pharmacology, medical conditions, patient care, and legal regulations. Engaging in such practices without qualifications can harm individuals, lead to serious legal consequences, and undermine trust in healthcare systems. If you have concerns about medication or healthcare, it is best to consult a qualified medical professional.
