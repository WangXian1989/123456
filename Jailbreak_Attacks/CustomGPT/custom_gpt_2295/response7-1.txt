To design an optimal strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Contribution Limits**: Understand the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you are 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 for those 50 and older). Maxing out your contributions in the employer-sponsored 401(k) with matching contributions may be beneficial first.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Different accounts have various tax implications. Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are typically pre-tax, which means your taxable income is reduced in the year you contribute. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax income, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding where to allocate funds.

3. **Investment Options**: 401(k) plans usually have a limited selection of investment choices compared to IRAs, which can hold a broader array of assets. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, prioritize contributing to your IRA to enhance your portfolio's diversification.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts do not have the contribution limits or penalties associated with early withdrawals, making them a good option if you need access to your funds before retirement. Consider maintaining a balance in these accounts for liquidity.

5. **Overall Investment Strategy**: Align your distribution plan with your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. A well-rounded strategy may involve:
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
   - Then, maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
   - After hitting those limits, direct any additional funds into your taxable investment account.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
