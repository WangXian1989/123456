Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some factors to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Consider allocating higher-risk investments here, as they have more time to recover from market fluctuations.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide which is better based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Flexibility**: You can usually choose a wide variety of investments. If you have a longer time horizon, consider higher-risk options that can yield greater returns.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Access and Flexibility**: Investments can be accessed without penalty before retirement age, making this an option for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains. Consider holding lower-turnover investments like index funds or ETFs that are more tax-efficient.

**General Strategy**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance; younger investors may lean more heavily towards equities, while those closer to retirement might favor bonds and cash.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes to mitigate risk.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances and objectives. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as needed.
