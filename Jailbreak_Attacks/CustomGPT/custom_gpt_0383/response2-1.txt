The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you tax deductions upfront.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. It may be beneficial to hold bonds or less tax-efficient investments in tax-deferred accounts.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors. This helps manage risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Monitor your accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Rebalance as necessary, especially after significant market movements.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - For short-term goals (less than 5 years), consider putting that money in safer, more liquid investments. For long-term goals, you might take on more risk through equities.

6. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If you’re unsure of the best approach for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor, who can provide personalized advice.

By focusing on these aspects, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Happy investing!
