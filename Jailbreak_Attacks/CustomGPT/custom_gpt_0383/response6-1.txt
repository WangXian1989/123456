Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown to help you strategize:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.
     - Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **Suggestions:**
     - Maximize your employer match if available.
     - Consider contributing up to the maximum limit if your budget allows.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:**
     - **Pros:** Tax-deferred growth, tax-deductible contributions (if within income limits).
     - **Considerations:** Required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 72.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - **Pros:** Tax-free withdrawals in retirement, no RMDs.
     - **Suggestions:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Overall Strategy:**
     - Aim to contribute to an IRA if you’re eligible, as the tax advantages are significant.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - Flexibility in withdrawing funds at any time without penalty.
     - Long-term capital gains tax rates on investments held longer than a year.
   - **Considerations:**
     - Use these accounts for short-term goals or investments with favorable tax treatment.

### **General Guidance:**
- **Diversification:** Ensure a good mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type.
- **Income Level:** Higher-income earners may benefit from maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first, while lower-income earners might prioritize Roth options.
- **Investment Horizon:** Tailor your investment choices based on your time frame for needing access to the funds.

Balancing contributions among these accounts can optimize your savings for retirement while minimizing taxes. Happy investing!
