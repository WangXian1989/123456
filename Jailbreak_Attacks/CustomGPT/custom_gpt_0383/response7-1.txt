Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund First**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to your traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that are beneficial for long-term growth.

4. **401(k) Contributions**: Once you have maxed out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) to increase your retirement savings. If you are under the age limit, you might want to go for a Roth 401(k) option if available.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for goals that are shorter-term. They can also be used for investments in tax-efficient funds or stocks that create fewer taxable events.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, riskier investments can be placed in tax-deferred accounts to maximize growth over time.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances. 

Happy Investing!
