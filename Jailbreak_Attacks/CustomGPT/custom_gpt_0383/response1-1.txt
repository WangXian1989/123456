The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Pros**: Offers pre-tax contributions, potential employer matching, and tax-deferred growth.
   - **Cons**: Limited investment choices, potential fees, and penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Strategy**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money). If you're maximizing that, consider how much tax advantage you might still gain from contributions.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Pros**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, and Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals (if rules are followed).
   - **Cons**: Contribution limits and income restrictions for Roth contributions.
   - **Strategy**: If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be a powerful tool for tax-free growth. If you think you might be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth could save you more on taxes in the long run.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros**: Unlimited contributions, flexibility in withdrawals, and more investment options.
   - **Cons**: Tax on capital gains and dividend income.
   - **Strategy**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access in the short term or which are less tax-efficient, like stocks or ETFs.

### General Distribution Strategies:
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Focus on your 401(k) and IRA contributions before adding funds to taxable accounts.
- **Consider tax implications**: Place investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
- **Regularly reassess**: Life changes, market conditions, and changes to tax laws can all affect your strategy, so periodically review and adjust your allocations.
