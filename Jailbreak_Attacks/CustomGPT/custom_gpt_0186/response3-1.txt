Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term Needs:** Allocate funds to taxable accounts if you need liquidity.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first.
   - **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Funds in 401(k) and IRAs grow tax-deferred (and tax-free for Roth IRAs).
   - Taxes are due upon withdrawal from 401(k) and traditional IRAs; however, withdrawals from taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Different accounts may have different investment strategies based on your risk tolerance.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Review your investments regularly and adjust based on life changes, such as income, financial goals, or market conditions.

By strategically distributing your funds according to these considerations, you can optimize for growth, tax efficiency, and accessibility. Consulting a financial advisor may also help tailor your strategy to your unique situation.
