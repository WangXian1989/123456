Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider for optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and retirement tax strategy.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits: $22,500 for 401(k)s (2023) and $6,500 for IRAs. If you're over 50, catch-up contributions are allowed.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Strategically**:
   - Invest funds in taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This can include investments in low-turnover index funds or tax-efficient ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. For example, withdrawing from a traditional 401(k) or IRA incurs ordinary income tax, while qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

5. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**:
   - Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market conditions and life changes.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
