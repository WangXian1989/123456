The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deduction benefits now; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement (contributions are made with after-tax dollars).

3. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure to have liquid cash in savings before heavily investing in accounts with penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income (e.g., stocks, mutual funds) since they don’t have contribution limits or withdrawal penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on performance and changing goals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
