Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to IRAs and 401(k)s for tax advantages. For a traditional IRA or 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income.

3. **Roth Accounts**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out retirement accounts, taxable accounts can be appealing due to their liquidity and flexibility. Use these for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Keep in mind your investment horizon and risk tolerance. Stocks may be more suitable for long-term accounts, while bonds could be preferred in taxable accounts to mitigate tax implications from interest income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your distribution annually to adjust for market changes and maintain your desired asset allocation.

Make sure to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
