To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages can be beneficial, especially if you're eligible for a Roth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income, like bonds or high-turnover funds. This way, you can manage tax liabilities more effectively.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk. Consider balancing asset allocation based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, typically starting with taxable accounts.

For personalized advice, consulting a financial advisor is always recommended.
