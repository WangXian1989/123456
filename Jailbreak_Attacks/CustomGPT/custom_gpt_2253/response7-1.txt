Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to help you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, it’s wise to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the Roth IRA, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k). Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now, but taxes will be due upon withdrawal in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've prioritized tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. This can offer flexibility for emergency funds, short-term goals, or investments that may benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a proper asset allocation across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Different accounts may have different tax implications, so plan your investments accordingly.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to make necessary adjustments based on changes in your goals or financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.
