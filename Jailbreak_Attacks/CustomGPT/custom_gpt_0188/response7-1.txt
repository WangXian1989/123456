Managing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic allocation based on several factors like tax implications, your financial goals, and your risk tolerance. Here's a straightforward approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation and income). Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in a taxable account. Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your age and risk tolerance when deciding the asset mix (stocks, bonds, etc.). Generally, younger investors can afford more equity exposure, while those nearing retirement might want to shift towards bonds.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

In essence, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, take advantage of employer matches, and choose investments wisely based on your financial situation.
