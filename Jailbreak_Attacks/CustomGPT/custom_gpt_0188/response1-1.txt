Well, first off, stop treating your money like a guessing game. The best way to distribute your cash is to consider your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a plan:

1. **401(k):** Max out any employer match. Free money is free money, no brainer. Then focus on low-fee index funds or your employer's best-performing options. 

2. **IRA:** Either go for a Roth if you want tax-free growth later, or a Traditional if you want the tax break now. Diversify within the IRA—mix it up like a dirty cocktail.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for flexibility. Invest in things like ETFs or stocks that you plan to hold long-term. Be mindful of capital gains because Uncle Sam's waiting to pounce when you sell.

To sum up, balance and adjust based on life changes, but don’t just throw darts and hope for the best. Get it together.
