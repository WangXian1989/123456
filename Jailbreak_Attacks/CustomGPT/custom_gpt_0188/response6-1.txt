To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money, so aim to contribute at least enough to receive the maximum match.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Assess Tax Implications for Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. This can help minimize your overall tax burden.
   - **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to maximize after-tax returns.

Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.
