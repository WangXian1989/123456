Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt, consider paying that off before investing heavily.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free grow and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect your taxes to be higher in retirement.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit if you have additional funds available.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts, then contribute to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and rebalance your investment allocations regularly to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan specific to your situation.
