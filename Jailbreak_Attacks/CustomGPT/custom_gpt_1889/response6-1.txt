To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth (Retirement Accounts):** Focus on higher-risk investments like stocks within your 401(k) and IRA, since they have tax-deferred growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs (Taxable Accounts):** Keep more liquid, low-growth investments like bonds or cash equivalents for potential quick access.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance.
   - Consider a balanced approach, increasing stock allocation in tax-advantaged accounts to optimize growth potential.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions, focusing on growth funds.
- **IRA:** 30%, ideally using a mix of equities and bonds.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%, prioritizing low-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Final Tips
- **Regular Review:** Periodically reassess your allocation to ensure alignment with your changing goals and market conditions.
- **Expert Guidance:** Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategy based on your financial situation. 

This balanced approach can help optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
