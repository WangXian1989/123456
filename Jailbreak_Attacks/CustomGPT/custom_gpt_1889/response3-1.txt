When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Taxation Awareness**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, meaning you defer taxes until withdrawal. Focus on maximizing employer matches first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider converting to a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Use these accounts for assets expected to appreciate over time.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. Taxable accounts might be better for short-term needs due to their flexibility. 

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth. Reserve more stable investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts to manage tax liability.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. 

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to these accounts to benefit from tax advantages.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that optimizes your investment growth and minimizes tax liabilities.
