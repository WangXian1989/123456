Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors, including your financial goals, timeline, and tax implications. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k), if you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

### 2. **Assessing Contribution Limits:**
   - For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older). The IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 and older).
   - Ensure you're aware of these limits and how they affect your distribution strategy.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings are taxed; consider holding lower-taxed investments (like index funds) here to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Diversifying Investments:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth through a mix of stocks and bonds. Target-date funds or a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance can be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider investments that may generate favorable tax treatment, such as qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Ensure you maintain accessibility for funds you may need in the short term in taxable accounts, as withdrawing from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Your financial situation and goals may change, so review your asset distribution and adjust contributions as necessary.

### Conclusion:
Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, evaluate your tax situation, and then allocate funds to taxable investments with an eye on diversification. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your unique situation.
