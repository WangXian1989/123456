Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors: your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start by maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially "free money."
   - Next, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth), meaning they grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed for Traditional accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are not tax-advantaged, so consider using them for investments that generate low capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Focus on long-term growth assets (stocks) in these accounts since they're intended for retirement. Utilize low-cost index funds or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more stable, income-generating assets (like bonds) or tax-efficient funds to limit taxes on capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses before heavily investing.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to seek personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This approach balances growth potential with tax efficiency, optimizing your investment for the long term.
