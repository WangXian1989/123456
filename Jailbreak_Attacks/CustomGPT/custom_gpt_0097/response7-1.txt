Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investing in tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Investment Horizon**
   - If youâ€™re younger and have a longer time until retirement, consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) in both your IRA and 401(k).
   - For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that all accounts are properly diversified. Use each account type to balance risk.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Having a strategy for tax-efficient withdrawals can help maximize your income.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations across accounts to maintain your desired risk profile.

### Example Distribution:
- Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Max out an IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation).
- Invest any additional savings in a taxable account for flexibility.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
