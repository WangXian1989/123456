To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; consider pre-tax and Roth options based on your tax situation.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Balance Asset Allocation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Withdrawals:**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes in retirement. Use taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

4. **Review Regularly:**
   - Assess your investment strategy and reallocate as needed based on performance, changes in income, or tax laws.

These steps can help you maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
