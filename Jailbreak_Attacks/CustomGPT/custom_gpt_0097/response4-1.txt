Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contributions**: If you can afford it, try to maximize contributions within the annual limits.

2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals; Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now but taxes later.
   - **Contribute to Both**: If eligible, consider contributing to both types to diversify tax treatment.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when you need flexibility, as they don’t have withdrawal restrictions like retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before making long-term investments.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when deciding your asset allocation across these accounts.

5. **Consult a Professional**: It might be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific needs.

Consider these points to create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial objectives.
