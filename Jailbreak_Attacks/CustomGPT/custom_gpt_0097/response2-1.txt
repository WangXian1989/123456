Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several key considerations:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, and the money grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductibility, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed in the year theyâ€™re realized, which can affect your overall tax burden.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals: Use taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - Long-term goals (retirement): Focus on 401(k) and IRA for the benefits of tax deferral and growth.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer 401(k) match first.
   - Contribute to an IRA up to the annual limit.
   - Invest any additional savings in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to an IRA (consider Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
3. **Additional Contributions**: Once you meet the above, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any excess savings to contribute to taxable accounts.

### Regular Review:
Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for changes in income or tax laws.

Consult a financial advisor to customize this strategy to your personal financial situation.
