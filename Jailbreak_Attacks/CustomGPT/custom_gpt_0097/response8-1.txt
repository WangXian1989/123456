To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (traditional or Roth IRAs). These offer tax benefits that can enhance growth.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. A traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions but taxes on withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investing after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility but require careful tax planning regarding capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust your allocations as your situation, goals, or market conditions change.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs and goals.
