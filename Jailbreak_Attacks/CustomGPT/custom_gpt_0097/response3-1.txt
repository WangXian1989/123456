Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some best practices:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, but contributions are pre-tax and distributions are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can be taxed in the year they are sold or generate income, but offer more flexibility.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to balance risk and return.

4. **Account for Time Horizon**: If you expect to access money soon, favor taxable accounts (more liquid). For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, thereby minimizing tax impact.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changing goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy tailored to your situation.
