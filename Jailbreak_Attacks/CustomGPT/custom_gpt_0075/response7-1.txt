The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) before taxable accounts. The goal is to maximize tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

3. **401(k)**: Consider contributing up to the annual contribution limit. If your employer offers a Roth option, think about whether to use pre-tax contributions or after-tax, depending on your current and anticipated future tax bracket.

4. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, and it aligns with your financial goals, consider directing some funds here for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you choose a Traditional IRA, you may get an immediate tax deduction.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investment opportunities. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Ultimate Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes and consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies if applicable.

7. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and tax laws change.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can give personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.

Happy investing!
