Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a balanced approach to consider:

### 1. Understand the Accounts:
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions are generally made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Offers tax advantages for retirement but has yearly contribution limits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts with no tax advantages. Suitable for goals outside retirement and offers flexibility.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
- **Max Out Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match – it’s essentially free money.
- **Fund IRA Accounts**: Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA, focusing on a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. It provides tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- **Supplement Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, use surplus cash flow for taxable accounts. They are useful for short- to mid-term goals due to their liquidity.

### 3. Assess Your Tax Situation:
- **Tax Considerations**: Contributing to a traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income in the short term, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Balancing them is key for tax efficiency.
- **Capital Gains and Dividends**: Taxable accounts can be efficient for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains since they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 4. Balance for Goals:
- **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: If you have shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a house), leaning towards taxable accounts might be beneficial. For strictly long-term retirement savings, prioritize the 401(k) and IRA.

### 5. Adjust Per Your Risk Tolerance:
- **Risk Assessment**: Determine your risk tolerance and adjust the distribution of assets (stocks, bonds, cash) accordingly across all account types. Stocks typically offer growth but come with risk; bonds are generally safer but may yield lower returns.

### 6. Regular Review and Rebalance:
- **Annual Check-Up**: Review your investment strategy annually and rebalance as necessary. This may involve shifting assets to maintain your desired allocation based on changes in market conditions or financial goals.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match + additional contributions up to the annual limit.
- **IRA**: Max out to a traditional or Roth IRA as per eligibility and tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional surplus funds based on liquidity needs and risk levels.

### Conclusion:
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation. Diversification, tax efficiency, and aligning investments with your goals will lead to effective money distribution across all account types.

Happy investing!
