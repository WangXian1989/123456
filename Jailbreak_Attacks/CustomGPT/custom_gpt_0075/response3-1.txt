Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your current income, financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for investments. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax advantages, including pre-tax contributions and potential employer matching. Contributions reduce your taxable income, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals:**
   - If you plan to retire in the next 5–10 years, focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits.
   - For short-term goals (such as purchasing a house or funding education), consider keeping money in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Contribute to your 401(k)** up to the employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - After maximizing employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you’re eligible, prioritize Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.
   - Once you max out these accounts, any extra savings can go into taxable accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Match your investment strategy to each account’s tax implications:
     - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Invest in higher-growth assets (stocks) since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRAs:** Consider holding growth-oriented investments for future tax-free withdrawals.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** It’s often best to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, market conditions, or financial goals. Make adjustments to rebalance your portfolio as necessary.
   - Keep track of tax implications resulting from changes in your investment strategy.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor the distribution strategy to fit your unique situation, especially for intricate tax considerations.

### Summary
To optimize the distribution of your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:
- Prioritize employer matching in 401(k).
- Take advantage of tax benefits in IRAs.
- Use taxable accounts for liquidity and diversification.
- Maintain a strategy aligned with your financial goals and tax situations.

By employing these strategies, you can build a well-rounded and tax-efficient investment portfolio.
