Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven’t reached the match, focus on maxing out your contribution here next. Consider increasing to the annual maximum limit if you're able.
   - **IRA**: If you have more to invest after your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial for tax planning.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable investment accounts. This gives you flexibility and liquidity, although it doesn’t provide the same tax advantages.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors may lean towards equities for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer more stable investments like bonds.

5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your overall investment distribution and rebalance as necessary, ensuring alignment with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your unique situation.

This strategy can help you grow your investments while managing tax implications effectively.
