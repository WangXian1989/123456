To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k) First**: Max out any employer match in your 401(k), as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Next**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can then go into taxable accounts.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider using tax-efficient investment strategies since these accounts are tax-advantaged.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or ETFs, which generate fewer taxable events. Municipal bonds can also be a good choice for these accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax Deferral**: Utilize retirement accounts for assets that generate ordinary income (like bonds) to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Investments**: Invest in assets that generate capital gains (like stocks), as these may be taxed at lower rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw funds from these accounts. Generally, itâ€™s recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize taxes over time.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they still align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your investments and optimize your tax situation for long-term growth.
