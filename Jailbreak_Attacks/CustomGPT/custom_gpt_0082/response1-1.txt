Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and Traditional IRA grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free; consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for money you may need before retirement; be aware of capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative, income-generating investments (like bonds) that may generate taxable income.

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly reassess your allocation based on market conditions and changing financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

This strategy helps maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
