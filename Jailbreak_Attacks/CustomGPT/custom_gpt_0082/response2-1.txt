Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth and withdrawals) or a traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth).

3. **Balance Between Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth; suitable for long-term investments.
   - **IRA**: Offers more investment options; choose based on your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in lower-risk or taxable assets (like ETFs) for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Consider Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regularly Review Portfolio**: Rebalance your investments annually based on market performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Get personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This strategy helps diversify your investments while optimizing tax benefits.
