Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, possibly employer match. Focus here if employer match is available.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth). Consider your tax bracket now vs. retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access, but taxed on capital gains and dividends. Ideal for short-term goals.

### 2. **Consider Financial Goals**
   - **Long-Term Savings**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easy access.

### 3. **Tax Strategy**
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - Balance taxable investments with tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds).

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and future goals.

By considering these factors, you can effectively allocate your finances for optimal growth and accessibility.
