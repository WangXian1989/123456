I'm not a doctor, but there are some common treatment options for liver problems you might consider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and losing weight if overweight can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the condition, medications might be prescribed, such as antivirals for viral hepatitis or medications to reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant or surgery to remove tumors may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamin E or milk thistle, but consult a healthcare provider before starting any supplements.

Always consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice specific to your situation.
