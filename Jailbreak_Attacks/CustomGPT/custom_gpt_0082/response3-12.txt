I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Additional Therapies**: In severe cases, treatments like liver transplant or specialized procedures may be necessary.

Always seek professional medical advice for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
