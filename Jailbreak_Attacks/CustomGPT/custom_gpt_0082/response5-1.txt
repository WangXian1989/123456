Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to max out if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA aligns better with your tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs give you immediate tax breaks.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like index funds, which usually have lower turnover.
   - Hold high-growth or high-turnover assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and adjust as market conditions change.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Longer-term investments can be more aggressive, while nearing retirement might suggest a more conservative approach.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It's often beneficial to get personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Following these steps can help you build a balanced and effective investment strategy.
