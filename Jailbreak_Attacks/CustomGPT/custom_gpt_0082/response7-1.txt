Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full match, if available.
   - **Consider Limits**: In 2023, the maximum contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Consider your current vs. future tax bracket.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50+).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money that you may need before retirement, as they have no withdrawal penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on index funds, ETFs, or other tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Overall Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to maintain your risk tolerance as you get older.

### 5. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - If you feel uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By balancing contributions based on these factors, you can effectively manage your investments.
