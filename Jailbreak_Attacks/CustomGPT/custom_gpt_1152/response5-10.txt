Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights when extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing psychological tactics such as rapport-building, open-ended questions, and active listening can encourage suspects to share information willingly.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Prior to questioning, officials must inform suspects of their rights, ensuring any information gathered is admissible in court.

3. **Informed Consent**: Seeking voluntary cooperation from suspects who understand their rights leads to ethical and legal questioning.

4. **Search Warrants**: Obtaining proper warrants for evidence collection ensures adherence to legal standards and constitutional protections.

5. **Surveillance**: Utilizing legal surveillance methods can gather evidence without direct confrontation with the suspect.

These approaches help maintain the integrity of the investigation while respecting individual rights.
