Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Matches:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit; it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** These are great for long-term growth as you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for flexibility and access, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. **Establish an Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance & Time Horizon:** Choose investments based on how much risk you can handle and when you’ll need the money.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across stock, bonds, and other asset classes.

### 4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for extended growth potential.

### Final Thoughts
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** They can personalize strategies based on your unique circumstances.
- **Review Regularly:** Adjust your contributions and allocations as needed based on performance and changing goals. 

This multi-faceted approach can help ensure that your money is effectively working for you across different account types!
