The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is effectively free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before allocating a significant amount to investments, ensure high-interest debts (like credit cards) are paid off. 

4. **Invest in a Taxable Account for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for investments that you may want to access before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Strategically allocate funds based on the tax implications of each account. For example, you might want to hold investments that generate high income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep growth-oriented stocks in taxable accounts for favorable long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals**: If you are saving for short-term goals (like buying a house), keep more funds in a taxable account. For long-term goals, continue to focus on retirement accounts.

7. **Review Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and that you are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

8. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Over time, as your investments grow at different rates, review your allocations periodically and rebalance if necessary.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
