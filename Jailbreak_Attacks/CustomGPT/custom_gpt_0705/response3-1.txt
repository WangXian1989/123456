To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with tax advantages. Contributions reduce your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax benefits similar to a 401(k) but with different contribution limits and rules. You can choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. These are more flexible for withdrawals and can provide liquidity for short-term goals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to IRAs**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. The contribution limit for IRAs is generally lower than for 401(k)s.

4. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize accounts based on tax efficiency. Generally, keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer or avoid taxes on capital gains. Fixed-income investments may be better suited for taxable accounts because they produce ordinary income, which is taxed at a higher rate.

5. **Diversify and Rebalance**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across accounts. Rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain your target asset allocation.

6. **Consider Retirement Timeline**:
   - Your age and expected retirement date will influence how aggressively you should invest. Younger individuals can afford to take more risks.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
