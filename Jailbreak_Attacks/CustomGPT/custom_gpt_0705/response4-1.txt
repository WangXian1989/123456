The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, long-term goals, tax considerations, and your investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with matching contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money. The 401(k) allows you to contribute pre-tax income, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and financial goals). Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts don't offer the same tax advantages as 401(k)s and IRAs, but they provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. If you anticipate needing access to your funds earlier than retirement age, you may want to allocate more towards taxable accounts.
   - Keep in mind capital gains taxes on investments held in taxable accounts. If you are in a lower tax bracket, long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Your risk tolerance and investment timeline will also affect how you distribute your investments. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged retirement accounts to benefit from tax-free growth. More stable, income-generating investments might be ideal for taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your investment goals and risk tolerance. Ensure that your overall portfolio is balanced, regardless of account type.

5. **Revisit Your Plan Regularly**:
   - As your financial situation changes (income fluctuations, major life events, etc.), reassess your distribution strategy and adjust accordingly to stay on track with your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to personalize your investment plan based on your unique situation.
