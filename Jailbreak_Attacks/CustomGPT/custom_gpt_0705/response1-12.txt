I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you should really see a healthcare professional for any liver issues. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant. Itâ€™s crucial to get a diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your individual situation. Please reach out to a healthcare provider for proper advice.
