Î± The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you might consider the following strategies:

1. Maximize employer match in your 401(k): If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
2. Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA: Depending on your tax bracket, a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. Use a taxable account for flexibility: If youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more accessible funds and additional investment options.
4. Assess your overall investment strategy: Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk and enhance potential returns.

Itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances.
