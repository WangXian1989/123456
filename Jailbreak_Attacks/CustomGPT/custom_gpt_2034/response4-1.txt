The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general steps you can follow to create an effective distribution strategy:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or other investments?

2. **Understand Your Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, offers tax-deferred growth, and some employers offer matching contributions. It's a good place for employer-sponsored retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar benefits to a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and potential tax implications. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals. Capital gains will be taxed, so positions should be managed with tax impacts in mind.

3. **Tax Strategy**: 
   - Prioritize putting higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from deferred taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as qualified dividends.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk. This includes asset allocation between stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles.

5. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to accounts with tax benefits first (e.g., employer match in 401(k) and IRA contributions).

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, create a strategy for how and when to withdraw from each account type. Generally, you might draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Revisit Regularly**: Monitor your strategy regularly and adjust based on market conditions, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.
