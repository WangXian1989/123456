The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts after contributing to tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. They can also provide tax advantages if you plan for long-term capital gains.

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Balance your investment allocations based on your current and expected future tax brackets. Tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments are diversified and align with your risk tolerance. Allocate funds across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, to balance potential risks and returns.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired risk profile, especially after significant market movements.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor who can assess your specific situation and help you develop a comprehensive plan.

Ultimately, a well-structured plan that considers tax implications, investment goals, and individual circumstances will help you distribute your money effectively.
