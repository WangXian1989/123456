Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the match, focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit (as of 2023, this is $22,500 per year, with an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, with a combined annual limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can put any additional savings into taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals, although you’ll pay capital gains taxes on any profits.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments can go in tax-advantaged accounts, where you may not withdraw until retirement, while more conservative investments might be in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals when you reach retirement. Take withdrawals from taxable accounts first, then 401(k) and IRA accounts to manage your tax bracket efficiently.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions, your financial situation, and changing goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your circumstances and goals.
