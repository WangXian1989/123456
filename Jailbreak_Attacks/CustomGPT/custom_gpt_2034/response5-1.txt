(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it can be prudent to prioritize contributions to the 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA for its tax advantages. If you still have money to invest after maxing out your retirement accounts, then you can focus on taxable accounts. It's also important to consider your overall asset allocation and ensure that you have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts.
