Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, investment goals, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your contributions to either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and Traditional IRA are tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Roth accounts provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, which is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Invest for Growth in Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., long-term capital gains or qualified dividends) or tax-efficient investments.
   - Consider holding bonds and high-turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid immediate taxation on interest and short-term gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified regardless of the account types.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to any changes in your financial goals or market conditions.

6. **Consider Retirement Timeline**:
   - If youâ€™re closer to retirement, shift towards more stable, income-generating investments in your 401(k) and IRA. For longer time horizons, a more aggressive growth strategy may be appropriate.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs and circumstances.
