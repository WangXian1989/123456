Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Fees and Investment Options:** Review the fees associated with your 401(k) plan, as they can vary significantly. Choose low-cost index funds if available.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax (unless you have a Roth 401(k)), reducing your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA each year. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Tax Strategy:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth but may require taxes upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Consider your current and expected future tax bracket when choosing between these.
   - **Early Withdrawal Flexibility:** Roth IRAs allow you to withdraw contributions at any time without penalty, providing more flexibility if needed.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After-Tax Investments:** If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing any additional money in taxable accounts.
   - **Managing Capital Gains:** Be mindful of investment strategies that minimize taxes, such as holding investments long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals, as they typically allow for more liquidity compared to retirement accounts.

### **Overall Distribution Strategy:**
- **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Your age and risk tolerance should influence how much you allocate to each account. Younger investors might focus more on retirement accounts for the tax advantages, while older investors may allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Diversification:** Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the type of account.
- **Regular Review:** Periodically assess your allocations and make adjustments based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy is one that aligns with your financial goals, tax circumstances, and risk tolerance. Balancing contributions across these account types can optimize your tax advantages while preparing for a secure financial future.
