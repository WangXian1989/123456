When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to focus on a strategy that aligns with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies and considerations to help guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a guaranteed return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deductible (traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth), making them advantageous for long-term growth.
     - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
     - **Roth 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes; qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - For individuals in a higher tax bracket, it may be wise to prioritize traditional accounts. Conversely, those in a lower bracket may benefit from Roth accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (stocks, for example) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where gains can compound tax-free, and preserve more conservative investments (bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest or dividends.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to manage risk. This applies to all accounts. 

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Consider contributing to taxable accounts for liquidity and access to funds before retirement age without penalties. This is useful for emergencies, big purchases, or other investment opportunities.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50).
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50).
   - Adjust your contributions based on these limits to optimize tax benefits.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing until required minimum distributions (RMDs) begin.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual situations can vary greatly based on personal circumstances, so consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies to optimize distributions and meet your retirement goals.

By considering these factors, you can develop a strategy that maximally leverages the benefits of each account type, while addressing your financial needs and future goals.
