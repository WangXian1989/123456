Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guide to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a diversified mix of investment options available in your plan (stocks, bonds, mutual funds).
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). Consider maxing out if possible.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: 
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Good for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement. This may benefit those in a higher tax bracket now than expected in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are not subject to contribution limits and allow for withdrawals whenever needed.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs), as capital gains and dividends will be taxed.
   - **Emergency Fund**: These accounts can also serve as an accessible emergency fund, separate from retirement savings.

### **General Allocation Strategy**
- **Short-term Needs**: Prioritize liquid assets and taxable accounts for immediate needs or goals within five years.
- **Long-term Growth**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth and tax benefits.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Given the complexities of tax implications and personal circumstances, it’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy.

#### Final Thoughts
Consider your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals when deciding how to allocate your investments across these accounts. Balancing tax efficiency with growth potential is key to effective money distribution.
