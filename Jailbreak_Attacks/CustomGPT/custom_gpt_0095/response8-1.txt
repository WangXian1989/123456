Distributing money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might access in the near term or for funds not used for retirement. This allows for greater liquidity.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (e.g., bonds, REITs) should go in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (e.g., index funds, ETFs) can be held in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation periodically based on performance and changes in your risk tolerance or future needs.

6. **Consider Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and future tax bracket when deciding how much to contribute to tax-deferred versus taxable accounts.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
