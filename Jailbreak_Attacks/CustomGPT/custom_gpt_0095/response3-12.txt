I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet with low-fat foods, fruits, and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral infections like hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid buildup.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Endoscopy**: For varices or bile duct obstructions.
   - **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver failure.

4. **Supplements**:
   - **Milk Thistle**: May support liver health (consult your doctor first).

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
