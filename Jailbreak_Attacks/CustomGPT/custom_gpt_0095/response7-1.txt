To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Investment Choices**:
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term growth investments (like stocks) since it's tax-deferred.
   - Consider bonds in your IRA to balance risk, especially if it's a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred).
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for tax implications when you eventually withdraw funds. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility without penalties after retirement age.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation on a regular basis to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation and goals.

This approach balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and risk management effectively.
