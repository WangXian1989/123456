To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k) First**: If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Next**: After the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use this for additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Place investments with high potential returns (stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments that generate capital gains or dividends (like bonds or real estate) here, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Tailor your investment strategy based on goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Higher-risk assets can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is sheltered.

4. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain your target asset allocation.

5. **Consider Fees**: 
   - Compare investment options within your 401(k) and choose lower-fee investments when possible.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications when you reach retirement.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance to align your strategy with your financial goals.
