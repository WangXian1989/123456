To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Fully fund your IRA (either traditional or Roth) as these accounts offer tax advantages.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding investments with lower tax implications here, like index funds or long-term growth stocks, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Place investments with higher expected growth (like stocks) since they grow tax-deferred.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Use for high-growth investments since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts if you're in a high tax bracket now, as they will help reduce your taxable income.

By focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged contributions first and strategically placing investments based on tax implications, you can optimize your overall wealth growth.
