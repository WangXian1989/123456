Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out your contributions if you're not yet at the limit ($22,500 for 2024; $30,000 if you’re over 50). This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a traditional IRA (if you qualify) or a Roth IRA (if you're eligible). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve tapped out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement. 

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Consider keeping growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Income Investments**: Place bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts, as they can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income when held in qualified accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan to withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts first to allow those accounts to continue growing tax-deferred.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity and individual nature of investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.

Ultimately, the best approach balances growth potential with tax efficiency and aligns with your long-term financial goals.
