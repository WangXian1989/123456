Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline for optimal distribution:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as they can be tax-deductible, depending on your income level.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - For 2023, the contribution limits are:  
     - **401(k):** $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older)  
     - **IRA:** $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older)  
   - Ensure you are aware of these limits when planning distributions.

### 3. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts can benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Consider Tax-Efficient Investments for Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax burdens, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to keep capital gains taxes minimal.

### 5. **Review Your Tax Bracket**
   - Strategically withdraw from tax-deferred accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs during lower-income years to minimize tax impact.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income, maximizing match.
- **IRA:** 10-15% of your income, maxing out contributions if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder of your savings, focusing on after-tax efficiency.

### Conclusion
Regularly reassess your financial situation and adjust your contributions to maintain alignment with your goals and changing tax laws. Prioritize high-interest debt or emergencies before aggressive investing.
