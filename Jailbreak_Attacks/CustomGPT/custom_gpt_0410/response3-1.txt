Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Standard investment accounts with no tax advantages. Capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they are realized.

### 2. Consider Your Goals

- **Retirement**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
- **Short-Term Needs**: More funds might be allocated to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 3. Contribution Strategy

- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Fund IRA**: After maxing the match, contribute to an IRA (consider a Roth IRA if you qualify for tax-free growth).
- **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After funding the IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k) until you reach annual limits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond retirement accounts or for expected short-term needs.

### 4. Asset Allocation

- **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on a diversified mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors might lean towards stocks for higher growth potential.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Choose tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax burdens.

### 5. Regular Review

- **Rebalance Portfolios**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Tax Liabilities**: Monitor the tax implications of withdrawals, especially from taxable accounts.

### 6. Professional Advice

- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be beneficial, especially concerning tax implications and retirement strategy.

### Conclusion

The best distribution strategy varies by individual situation. Prioritize maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, and regularly review your financial goals and progress.
