Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often includes matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested after-tax dollars that can be more flexible for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term needs or holding investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like qualified dividends).

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Contribute Enough to Get Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match level.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If possible, contribute the maximum to an IRA or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use these accounts for investments in assets that may appreciate over a longer time frame or to hold cash for emergencies.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider holding bonds in your 401(k) or IRA, where interest income is tax-deferred, and equities in taxable accounts for more favorable capital gains treatment.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50% (prioritize up to employer match, then max out)
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: 30% (max annual contributions if eligible)
- **Taxable Account**: 20% (invest surplus funds and more liquid needs)

### Monitoring and Adjusting
- Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

### Final Thoughts
Consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances, especially regarding contributions, investment choices, and withdrawal strategies.
