Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now but taxes are owed on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs have tax-deferred growth and tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are post-tax investment accounts. They allow for more flexibility in accessing funds but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Max out your 401(k) contributions, at least to the employer match limit, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Consider the Roth option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize traditional accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - Keep in mind the implications of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Consider holding investments for longer than a year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Adjust your investment strategy based on the type of account. For example, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.
   - Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize the employer match (e.g., 6% of your salary).
- **IRA**: Contribute $6,000 annually (or $7,000 if over 50), prioritizing Roth if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Summary
The best distribution varies by individual circumstances, so focus on maximizing employer matches and using tax-advantaged accounts efficiently to enhance long-term growth while considering tax implications for each type of account.
