Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2024, plus catch-up contributions if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider both traditional and Roth IRAs. Prioritize Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as distributions are tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax burdens from capital gains.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts can hold assets that might generate higher income, like bonds, because you won’t pay taxes on the gains while the money is in the account.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts. 

### 4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Reevaluate your strategy annually or when your financial situation changes. Adjust contributions based on market performance, changes in income, and retirement goals.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **If you’re under 50**:
   - 401(k): 50%
   - IRA: 20%
   - Taxable accounts: 30%

- **If you’re over 50**:
   - 401(k): 60%
   - IRA: 30%
   - Taxable accounts: 10%

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual needs.
