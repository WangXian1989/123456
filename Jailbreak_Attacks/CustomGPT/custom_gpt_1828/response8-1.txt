Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRAs**: If possible, contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). These accounts often provide tax advantages that can benefit your long-term growth.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you haven't reached the annual limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals, which might be beneficial if you want access to funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these accounts for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) since they have tax advantages. Consider more aggressive investments here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalancing and Adjusting**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor.

This strategic distribution will help you maximize growth and minimize tax implications over time.
