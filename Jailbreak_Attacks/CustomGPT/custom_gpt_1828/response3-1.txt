When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a guideline to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held outside retirement accounts. These are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you prefer the tax benefits of a Roth IRA.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds available, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings that you might need sooner, or for investments that don't fit within tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Plan for taxes: Contributing to tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) reduces your taxable income now but will create a tax burden later.
   - Investing in a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals, which may be beneficial if you believe you're in a higher tax bracket later in life.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you're diversifying your investments within each account. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).

### 5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically assess your financial situation, investment performance, and retirement goals. Adjust your allocations if necessary based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of income, up to employer match.
- **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50) annually if feasible.
- **Taxable Account**: Remainder of your investment budget after maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
Balancing investments across these accounts can optimize your long-term financial strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your approach based on personal circumstances.
