Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Current and Future Tax Brackets:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate. Avoid high-turnover investments that generate short-term capital gains taxed as ordinary income.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Growth Investments:** Hold high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to shield their potential gains from taxes.
   - **Income Investments:** Place income-generating assets like bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts when possible, as these may lead to higher taxes in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Ensure a balanced approach across all accounts. Diversifying your investments can help reduce risk.

### 5. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep enough liquid assets in your taxable account to cover short-term expenses without incurring penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### Conclusion:
The ideal distribution of your investments will depend on your specific financial situation and goals. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategy as your circumstances change is also vital. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your needs.
