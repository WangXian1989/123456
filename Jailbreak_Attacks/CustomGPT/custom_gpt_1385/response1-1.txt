Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth). 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Maximize Contributions**: Try to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA if possible. For 2023, the contribution limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or over)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or over)

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable brokerage accounts. This offers flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties, but you'll be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, consider diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and possibly REITs or other investments depending on your strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor a strategy that aligns with your goals.
