When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-deferred accounts first**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral on growth.
   - **Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Short-term vs. long-term**: Allocate more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, while keeping more liquid and conservative investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Retirement vs. other goals**: Ensure that your allocations align with your specific financial objectives and timelines.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **Know the limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to make the most of your investment.

4. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset allocation**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk and improve returns in each account.

By following these strategies, you can create a well-balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while meeting your financial goals.
