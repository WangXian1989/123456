When it comes to distributing your money among different investment accounts like your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to maximize your 401(k) contributions, keeping in mind the annual contribution limits set by the IRS.
   - Consider investing in a diversified mix of assets according to your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you’re looking for immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA might be more suitable, allowing for tax deductions on contributions.
   - Ensure you’re aware of the income limits for deductibility and contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Fund these accounts with investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) as capital gains taxes can apply when selling assets.
   - Use taxable accounts for flexible withdrawals, which can be beneficial for planned short-term expenses or capitalizing on investment opportunities.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Fill tax-advantaged accounts first; they often provide the best long-term growth and tax benefits.
   - Strategize withdrawals based on your income level in retirement to minimize tax impact.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and re-balance to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.
   - Monitor changes in tax laws and contribution limits that may impact your strategies.

In summary, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, choose the right mix of account types based on tax implications, and maintain flexibility with taxable accounts for short-term needs. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
