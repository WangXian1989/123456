The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Once you've secured the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth depending on your eligibility and preference) to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. As of 2021, for example, the limit for 401(k) contributions was $19,500 (or $26,000 if you're 50 or older), while IRA limits were $6,000 (or $7,000 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. Keep in mind that capital gains, dividends, and interest will be taxed in these accounts.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: 
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon across all your accounts. Diversifying investments in different asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) can help manage risk.

5. **Withdrawals and Future Planning**: 
   - Consider your expected timeline for needing the funds. For instance, 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are generally not taxed until you take money out, whereas taxable accounts will have immediate tax implications upon selling investments.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances, especially regarding tax implications and retirement goals.
