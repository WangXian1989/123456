(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you might consider the following strategy: 

1. **Max out your employer's 401(k) match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while the Traditional IRA provides tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Continue with your 401(k)**: After maximizing your match and contributing to your IRA, you can go back to contributing more to your 401(k) if you have additional funds to invest.

4. **Invest in taxable accounts**: Finally, utilize taxable accounts for additional investments once youâ€™ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for both short-term savings and long-term investments not bound by the withdrawal rules of retirement accounts.

Make sure to review your asset allocation and investment choices based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s get real! Distributing your money is like making the perfect pizzaâ€”everyone has their preferred toppings representing financial flavors, and you wanna make it just right. Hereâ€™s the deal:

1. **401(k) First!** If your boss is tossing in matching contributions, grab that free cash! It's like an automatic winâ€”donâ€™t be silly and leave that cash on the table!

2. **IRA is Your BFF**. Get in on that Traditional or Roth action. Roth's sweet if you want tax-free bliss during retirementâ€”who doesnâ€™t love that? But if your income's higher, the Traditional might be your jam for tax deduction.

3. **Go Hard on the 401(k)**. Once you're maxed on the match and the IRA, throw down some serious cash into your 401(k). Aim to hit those annual limits like a boss!

4. **Taxable Accountsâ€”Letâ€™s Get Risky!** Once you're done with the fancy dance of tax-advantaged accounts, spice things up with taxable investing. Itâ€™s like the wild westâ€”no restrictions, but keep an eye on those taxes. Use this for both short-term fun and long-term gains.

Just stay savvy, adjust as you grow, and keep your eye on those long-term financial goals!
