Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral infections like hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging studies to assess liver condition.

4. **Surgical Options**:
   - **Liver transplant**: In severe cases of liver failure.

5. **Supplements**:

Always consult a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
