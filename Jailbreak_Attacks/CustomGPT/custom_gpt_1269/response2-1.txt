Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to maximize tax efficiency, growth potential, and liquidity. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Consider contributing the maximum allowed for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Use a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs for a mix of stocks and bonds, depending on your risk tolerance.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate money here for short-term goals or emergencies since they provide liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events.

### 4. **General Tips**
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.
   - **Regular Contributions**: Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate market volatility.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Goals**
   - **Retirement Timeline**: As you approach retirement, shift more into conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Continuously assess your risk tolerance and adjust allocations accordingly.
