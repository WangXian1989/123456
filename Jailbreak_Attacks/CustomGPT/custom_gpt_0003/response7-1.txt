Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here's an overview of options for allocation:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) allow for tax-deferred growth. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification:** Use IRAs for diversified investments not available in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains tax. Favor investments with lower turnover rates to minimize tax implications.

### General Strategy:
- **Early Contributions:** Prioritize 401(k) contributions to get the match, then fund an IRA, especially if you qualify for the Roth option.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Consider keeping taxable investments in tax-efficient securities (like index funds) to manage tax responsibilities.
- **Regular Reevaluation:** Adjust your strategy as your financial situation and tax laws change.

### Final Thoughts:
Balancing your allocations requires a mix of immediate savings benefits and long-term growth potential, so consult a financial advisor for personalized advice suitable for your circumstances.
