Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some considerations to help you determine the best strategy:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial for high earners or those seeking an immediate tax break.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and other factors. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them advantageous for younger savers or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not provide tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for early withdrawals without penalties. However, dividends and capital gains are taxable in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Prioritize accounts based on short-term versus long-term goals. For retirement savings aimed at long-term growth, prioritizing 401(k) and IRA contributions may be best. For goals within the next few years (like buying a house), putting money into taxable accounts could be appropriate.

### 3. **Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

### 4. **Maximizing Contributions:**
   - In 2023, the contribution limits for a 401(k) are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and for an IRA, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Try to maximize contributions to these accounts first before directing money to taxable accounts.

### 5. **Consider Fees and Investment Choices:**
   - Review the fees associated with your 401(k) and the investment options available. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited investment choices, it may be better to prioritize IRA contributions, especially if you have low-cost options available.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
2. **Next**: Max out your IRA contributions.
3. **Then**: Contribute additional funds to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum contribution limit.
4. **Finally**: Invest any remaining money in a taxable account, especially if you want liquidity or flexibility in accessing your funds.

### Conclusion:
It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation or market conditions change.
