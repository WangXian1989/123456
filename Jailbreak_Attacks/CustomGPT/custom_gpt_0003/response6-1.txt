To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
- **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching contributions. Maximize contributions to receive any match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) but with lower contribution limits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, taxable accounts allow for greater flexibility in withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
- **Max out your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. 
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider the tax implications of a traditional vs. Roth IRA.
- **Utilize taxable accounts**: Once retirement accounts are maxed, invest in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient funds like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
- Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
- Consider bond investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly:
- Review your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
- Adjust contributions and withdrawals as needed to maintain your desired asset distribution.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across different account types, maximizing growth potential while minimizing tax implications. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
