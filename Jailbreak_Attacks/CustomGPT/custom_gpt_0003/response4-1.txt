Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, current income, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After taking full advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions upfront, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**:
   - If possible, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. 401(k) accounts often have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can look at contributing to a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for funds you may need before retirement or for more flexible investment options.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals from these accounts. Generally, withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

6. **Focus on Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account type, ensure a proper asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. This means balancing stocks, bonds, and other investments appropriately.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Before making any financial decisions, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
