Distributing your money among different investment accounts such as a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts involves several considerations related to your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement plans. Here are some key points to guide your decision:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: A retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer that allows you to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Contributions are often matched by the employer up to a certain percentage.
   - **IRA**: An individual retirement account that offers tax advantages for retirement savings. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have tax advantages. You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains earned in this account.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as they allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until retirement. This is especially beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider your current vs. expected future income to determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is best for you. If you expect your tax rate to increase, a Roth IRA may be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Account Considerations**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Account Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to receive the maximum match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA, as it provides additional tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Create a Taxable Account**: If you have additional savings after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for added flexibility (e.g., access to funds before retirement age).

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Choose your investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. Consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to minimize risk.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor the performance of your investments and adjust your contributions as your financial situation and goals change. Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds, focusing on long-term growth with tax-efficient investments.

### Summary
Finding the ideal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and investment strategy. As always, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your needs.
