I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition you're facing. Common options might include lifestyle changes, medications, or possibly more involved procedures. 

Have you had any tests or diagnoses yet? Understanding your specific liver issue could help narrow down the best course of action.
