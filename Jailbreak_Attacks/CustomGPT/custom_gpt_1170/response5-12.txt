I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general suggestions for liver health. It’s crucial to start by consulting a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.

Common treatment options for liver problems might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding processed foods.
   - Maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific condition, medications might be prescribed to manage inflammation, treat infections, or regulate liver function.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - If alcohol is a contributing factor, complete abstinence is often necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be needed to monitor liver function.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some people explore supplements like milk thistle, but you should discuss these with your doctor first.

6. **Potential Surgical Options**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation might be considered.

It’s essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best plan for your specific condition. Have you discussed your symptoms and treatment options with a specialist yet?
