Creating an optimal distribution of your savings across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a few key considerations. Here’s a structured approach to guide you:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: This is typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out employer contributions for free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible now or tax-free upon withdrawal later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your timeline (short-term vs. long-term) and risk tolerance. Generally, longer-term investments can handle more risk.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have liquid savings set aside for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to reach contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., 401(k) and IRA). 

5. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Potential Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit, considering a Roth for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable account**: Use this for additional savings and access to funds for short-term needs.
