Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages. Maxing out employer matches in your 401(k) is particularly beneficial.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions can reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed later.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs follow similar tax principles, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax, so you might consider keeping more volatile investments in these accounts.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Tailor investments based on your financial goals. Short-term goals might necessitate more liquidity, favoring taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks. 

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review your allocation as your financial circumstances and market conditions change.
