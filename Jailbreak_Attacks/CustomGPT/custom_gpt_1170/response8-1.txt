Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, if applicable. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If you’re not yet maxing out your 401(k), increase contributions to this account, as it offers tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income situation and tax preference. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Goals**: Tailor your investment choices based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your strategy.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider consulting a finance professional for personalized advice.
