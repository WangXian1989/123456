Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a strategic process that depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some factors to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Traditional IRAs have tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax situation and future expectations, you might choose one over the other.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easier access to funds and can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be aware that investments held here can be taxed on capital gains and dividends, which may influence your investment choices.

### Strategies for Balance:
- **Prioritize** contributions to take full advantage of employer matches in your 401(k) first, then focus on IRA contributions, and finally fill in with taxable accounts.
- **Consider Your Timeline**: Long-term savings might go into tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term savings can be placed into taxable accounts.
- **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Keep an eye on performance and consider rebalancing your portfolio based on your changing needs and market conditions.
