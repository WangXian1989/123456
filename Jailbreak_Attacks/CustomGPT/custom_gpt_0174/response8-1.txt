Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **401(k):** After your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit (if you haven't already).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments beyond your retirement accounts, especially if you need access to funds before retirement age or want more flexibility.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth assets (e.g., stocks) since these funds will be growing tax-deferred (or tax-free with a Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your investments as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation and goals by consulting a professional.

### Summary
Start with contributions that maximize matches, then aim to fully fund tax-advantaged accounts, and finally use taxable accounts for additional flexibility and investment opportunities. 

Happy investing!
