To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributions.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth and higher contribution limits. 

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (if eligible).
   - Traditional IRA for tax deductions if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Assess your tax bracket and investment goals.
- Prioritize contributions based on retirement timeline and expected withdrawals.
- Regularly rebalance your portfolio to align with changing market conditions and personal goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
