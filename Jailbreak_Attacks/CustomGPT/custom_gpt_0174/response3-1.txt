When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

### 1. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now, but you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs operate similarly to 401(k)s; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are taxed annually; consider holding investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds).

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds needed within a few years.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Ensure you maximize contributions to the 401(k) (up to employer match) and IRAs (check annual limits).

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** Consider holding higher-growth investments (stocks) due to tax deferral benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for more stable investments (bonds) or tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Fees and Expenses**
   - Compare fees in each account type and choose investments with lower costs where possible.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k):** Max out matching contributions.
2. **IRA:** Contribute up to the annual limit, favoring a Roth if eligible.
3. **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### Conclusion
Balance your investments with an emphasis on tax efficiency and alignment with your financial goals. Regularly review and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.
