To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit or employer match, as contributions are typically pre-tax (or Roth if preferred).
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax), depending on your tax bracket and income eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that may not benefit from tax-advantaged accounts (like certain stocks or funds).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) can be beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals by rebalancing across accounts as needed.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Pay attention to the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts, as you may incur capital gains taxes.
