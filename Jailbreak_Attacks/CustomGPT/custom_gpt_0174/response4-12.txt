I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Lifestyle Support**:
   - Counseling or support groups for substance use disorders if applicable.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always seek the advice of a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
