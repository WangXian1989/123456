1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., viral hepatitis), antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - Supplements or medications for liver support.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Abstaining from alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and condition progression.

5. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Controlling diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity can be beneficial.

6. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
