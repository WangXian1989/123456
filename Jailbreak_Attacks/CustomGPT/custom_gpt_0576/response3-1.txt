To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these three aspects:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both offer tax-deferred growth; contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income. Consider maximizing these contributions first, especially if your employer offers a match on your 401(k).
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), which provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - **Retirement Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): These should be oriented toward long-term growth. Consider a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are more flexible but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains. Focus on investments that generate lower taxable events, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Assess how much money you may need in the short term vs. long-term. Maintain enough liquid assets in your taxable accounts for emergency funds or immediate expenses.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out employer 401(k) match**: Contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Max out IRA contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA.
3. **Increase 401(k) contributions**: After maximizing IRA contributions, boost your 401(k) as much as possible.
4. **Allocate surplus to taxable accounts**: Finally, invest additional savings in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term growth with tax-efficient investments.

### Considerations:
- **Rebalance** regularly based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and long-term goals.
