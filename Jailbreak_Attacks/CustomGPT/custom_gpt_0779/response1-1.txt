Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider the Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals will be taxed. 
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing a Roth IRA can be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts don’t have tax advantages, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals. Capital gains and dividends are taxed, so consider this when investing.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure you have a good mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account. Different accounts can serve different purposes, and diversification across them can mitigate risk.

4. **Time Horizon:** If you plan to retire soon, you might want to be more conservative with your investments in the 401(k) and IRA. For longer-term savings in taxable accounts, you can afford to take on more risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement:** Plan how you’ll withdraw funds from each account. Often, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Every individual’s situation is unique, and a financial advisor can help you create a personalized strategy that considers your entire financial picture.

Ultimately, it’s about balancing immediate tax benefits with long-term savings growth and preparing for your individual retirement needs.
