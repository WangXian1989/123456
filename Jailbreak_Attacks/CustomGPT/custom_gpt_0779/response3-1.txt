When deciding how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, tax implications, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach you might consider:

1. **Understand the Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that often includes employer matching contributions. Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** This account offers tax advantages for retirement savings. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts have no tax advantages for retirement savings but allow for greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding between Traditional and Roth accounts.
   - For your taxable account, be mindful of capital gains tax; consider tax-efficient investments.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Consider placing more aggressive investments in accounts with tax advantages (like your 401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax-efficiency.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a readily accessible account.

6. **Revisit and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your investment strategy and account balances, adjusting your contributions as necessary based on life changes or financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively allocate your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work toward a secure financial future. If needed, consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
