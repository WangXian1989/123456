When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider various factors including tax implications, investment goals, risk tolerance, and your time horizon for needing the funds. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If you have access to a 401(k) with an employer match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA as well, taking advantage of its tax benefits. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but there are income limits for contributions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA reduce your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. A Roth IRA offers the opposite: you pay taxes now, but your withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you may choose to favor one type over the other.

3. **Consider Investment Options:**
   - Compare the investment choices available in your 401(k) to those in your IRA and taxable accounts. If your 401(k) offers limited options, you might allocate more funds to your IRA or taxable accounts where you can select from a broader range of investments.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for short-term goals. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment profits.
   - Consider placing investments with higher tax implications, like bonds or actively managed funds, in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

5. **Review Your Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger investors may favor more aggressive investments in their tax-advantaged accounts for growth, while older investors might focus on more stable investments as they approach retirement.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is well-diversified across all accounts to reduce risk. 

7. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolios across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation in response to market changes.

8. **Professional Guidance:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your individual financial situation and goals.

By considering these strategies, you can make informed decisions about how to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work toward your long-term financial goals.
