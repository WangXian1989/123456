The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts**: Contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income in the year they are made. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investments in these accounts do not provide tax advantages for contributions, but you can benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**:
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA each year. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals**:
   - Invest in a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors may lean more towards equities for growth, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds for stability.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for goals with a shorter timeline, as they provide more liquidity compared to retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance by reviewing and rebalancing your portfolios periodically.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture, including retirement planning and tax strategies.

By carefully considering these factors and creating a balanced approach, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
