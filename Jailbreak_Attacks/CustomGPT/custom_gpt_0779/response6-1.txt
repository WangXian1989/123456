To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. The contribution limits can help you take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize higher-yield, tax-inefficient investments in these accounts to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Type Distribution**:
   - Allocate more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts, while keeping more stable income-producing investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

By taking these steps, you can effectively manage your investment across different account types while maximizing tax efficiency and potential growth.
