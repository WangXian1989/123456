Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some generally recommended strategies:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough to Get Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If possible, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Consider Income Limits**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free growth. A traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits if you qualify for tax deductions.
   - **Diversify Between Traditional and Roth Accounts**: If you expect your tax rate to increase in the future, lean toward Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term, such as buying a home or travel, where you might need access to funds without penalties.
   - **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs that generate lower taxable distributions.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before making significant investments in any account.
- **Balanced Approach**: Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) over taxable accounts from a long-term growth perspective.
- **Age Considerations**: Younger individuals may prioritize growth in taxable investments, while those closer to retirement may favor the security of tax-advantaged accounts.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.
