To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax benefits upfront, but you have flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
   - For the 2023 tax year, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (plus $7,500 if over age 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 if over age 50).

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for assets that generate significant taxable income (like bonds or REITs).
   - Hold investments that are subject to long-term capital gains tax (like stocks) in taxable accounts for favorable tax treatment.

### 5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals to decide how to allocate funds across these accounts. 
   - Diversify your investments to balance risk and return.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your target asset allocation.

### 7. **Consider Withdrawals**
   - Plan for future withdrawals; 401(k) and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts do not.

### Conclusion
Start by funding your 401(k) to the match, then your IRA, and then allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts, keeping tax efficiency in mind. Regularly review and adjust based on your financial goals and market conditions.
