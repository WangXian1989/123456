Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Consider Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs Long-Term**: Determine what you are saving for. Retirement accounts are generally for long-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals are taxed later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account type.
   - Keep in mind that investment options may vary between 401(k) and IRA providers.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Prioritize having 3-6 months of expenses in a separate, easily accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 6. **Age and Time Horizon**
   - Younger investors might prioritize stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As retirement approaches, shift towards safer investments in these accounts.

### 7. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for short-term goals or when you've maxed out retirement contributions.
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax when selling investments.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **First 401(k) Contribution**: Up to the employer match.
2. **Traditional or Roth IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible.
3. **Continue 401(k)**: Increase contributions to the maximum allowable limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for any additional savings or after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Regular Reviews
- Annually assess your investments and adjust as needed based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

This general approach can be tailored to fit your unique situation, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.
