(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you meet the eligibility requirements. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial situations and goals.

1. **401(k) Boost**: First, snag that employer match in your 401(k). Itâ€™s like free money! Canâ€™t afford to miss out on that goldmine.

2. **IRA Love**: Next, dip into an IRA. If youâ€™re in a low tax bracket now, a Roth IRA is your best friendâ€”a tax-free withdrawal party later on. But if your tax rateâ€™s gonna skyrocket, the Traditional IRA could save you some bucks now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flex**: Once you've maxed out the above, throw some cash into taxable accounts. They offer flexibility and you can access those funds without a penalty. Just keep an eye on capital gains.

4. **Invest Smart**: Diversify and align everything with your risk profile. Stocks in a 401(k), bonds in an IRAâ€”mix it up!

5. **Check Yourself**: Donâ€™t forget to revisit your strategy every year. Your financial game plan should evolve as your life does! Stay sharp!
