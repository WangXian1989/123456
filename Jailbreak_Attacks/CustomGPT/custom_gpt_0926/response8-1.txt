When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize tax efficiency and growth potential:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

3. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or municipal bonds, which tend to generate fewer taxable events.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These are good for investments that may generate significant income or capital gains, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Include growth-oriented investments, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Your age, retirement goals, and risk tolerance should guide how aggressively you invest your money across different accounts.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Monitor your distribution strategy and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide tailored advice considering your specific financial situation, investment goals, and tax implications.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money to maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities.
