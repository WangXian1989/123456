Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough**: Start by contributing at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket. The contribution limits are lower than those for a 401(k), but the tax advantages can be significant.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs for long-term investments, as you won't pay taxes on growth until withdrawal.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks may be better suited for long-term accounts due to potential for greater growth, while bonds could be more appropriate for short-term needs.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts. This helps manage risk and can enhance returns.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan ahead for withdrawals, taking into account tax implications. Typically, it's better to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally from tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

### Conclusion
The ideal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
