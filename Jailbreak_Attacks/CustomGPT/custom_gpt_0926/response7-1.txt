Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Employers may offer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Contributions to a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions. Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are taxed as capital gains and dividends, which can be less favorable than retirement accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Retirement Accounts:** After capturing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, particularly if it’s a Roth IRA for the tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out retirement accounts, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals but less favorable tax treatment on gains.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Younger investors may focus on maxing retirement accounts for long-term growth, while those closer to retirement might balance liquidity with growth.
   - Keep in mind your investment strategy; growth-oriented investments may be more suitable for retirement accounts due to their long-term nature.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Annually reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, investment performance, and life circumstances.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often involves maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, then using taxable accounts for additional investments. Tailor your strategy to your situation and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
