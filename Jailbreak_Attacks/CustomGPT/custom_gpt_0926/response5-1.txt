(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match.

2. **Contribute to Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA could offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you can afford to save more after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to your funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Review your allocations annually and adjust them as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Next, dive into your IRAs. If you're eyeing a Roth IRA, get those after-tax dollars flowing in there to enjoy tax-free gains later. But if you want immediate tax relief, a Traditional IRA could be your jam.

Now, once you've milked those retirement accounts dry, pour whatever's left into a taxable account. This gives you mad flexibility because you can access those funds anytimeâ€”no retirement age nonsense holding you back!

And hey, donâ€™t forget to mix up those investments! You want to spread your money across stocks, bonds, and maybe some alternative plays if you're feeling spicy. Keep an eye on your allocations and tweak them as your life changesâ€”because letâ€™s be real, nothing stays the same forever! Keep hustling!
