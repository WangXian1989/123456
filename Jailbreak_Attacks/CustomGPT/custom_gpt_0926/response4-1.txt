Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options and fees associated with your plan. Opt for low-cost index funds if available.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Tax Treatment**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and make sure to maximize them if possible.
   - **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Roth IRAs generally offer more flexibility for withdrawals (e.g., you can withdraw contributions without penalties).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Flexibility**: These accounts offer the most flexibility in terms of access to funds and investment choices.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Consider holding investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Diversity of Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds, ETFs, or tax-efficient mutual funds.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Fund IRAs**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, focusing on a Roth if you qualify and plan for tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After that, use any remaining funds for investments in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.
4. **Consider Your Goals**: Align your investments with your long-term financial goals—retirement, buying a home, or other investments—and adjust your contributions accordingly.

### **Review Regularly**
- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep an eye on changes in tax laws and contribution limits, and adjust your strategy as needed.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
If you're uncertain or have complex financial circumstances, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a specific strategy for your needs.
