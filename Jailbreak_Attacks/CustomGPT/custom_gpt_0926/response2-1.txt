Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**:
   - If you have any high-interest debt (e.g., credit cards), consider paying that down before aggressively contributing to retirement accounts.

### 3. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income and retirement goals. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income now.

### 4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After fully funding your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you’re approaching retirement age.

### 5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for short- to mid-term goals (buying a house, travel) since money can be accessed without penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains tax.

### 6. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 7. **Review Tax Implications**:
   - Consider the tax treatment of withdrawals from each account type. Plan your distributions in retirement to optimize your tax situation.

### 8. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Financial circumstances and tax laws can change, so review your allocation periodically.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% (including employer contributions)
- **IRA**: Max out annual contributions (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if you're 50+)
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining funds based on liquidity needs and financial goals.

### Final Tips:
- Consult a financial advisor for a tailored plan based on your unique situation.
- Monitor your retirement accounts and adjust contributions as your income and goals evolve. 

This approach helps ensure you’re taking full advantage of available tax benefits while also keeping your financial options open.
