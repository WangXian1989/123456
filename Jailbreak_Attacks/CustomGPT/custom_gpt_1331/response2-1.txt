Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money!

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA or 401(k):** Contributions to these accounts are typically tax-deductible and grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider investing in long-term growth assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates. 
   - **Tax-efficient Funds:** Use tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax consequences.

### 4. **Allocate Based on Needs:**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term Goals:** For short-term goals, like buying a house in the next few years, keep money in easier-to-access taxable accounts. For retirement, focus on maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust as necessary based on market performance and changes in your financial circumstances or goals.

### 6. **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger individuals can typically afford more risk in their portfolios, whereas those closer to retirement may want to prioritize stability.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your total savings (maximize employer match)
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 10-15% based on your contribution limits and tax strategy
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth assets

### Conclusion:
Tailor your distribution strategy to align with your personal financial goals and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice. This approach can help you maximize growth while managing risk effectively.
