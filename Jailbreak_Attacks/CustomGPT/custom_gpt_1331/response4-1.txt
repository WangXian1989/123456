To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use any additional funds for taxable accounts. These provide more investment flexibility and accessibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Balance your investments by considering the tax implications. Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less income, such as bonds.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations to ensure they align with your financial objectives and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your individual situation.
