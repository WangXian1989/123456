To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you can consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer similar benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, but you can utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Assess Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you're closer to retirement, prioritize traditional accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) for tax-deferred growth.
   - If you have time on your side, prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider bonds in taxable accounts to offset potential capital gains tax, while being more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate savings account before allocating heavily into retirement accounts.

### 6. **Review Contributions Annually:**
   - Adjust contributions based on performance, tax laws, and changes in your financial situation.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the match + max out if possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth if eligible; otherwise, maximize your traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest excess after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Strategy:
- **Initial Savings:** Start by contributing 15% of your income to your 401(k) (enough for the match) and then add to an IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out the IRA, shift focus back to the taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Final Tips:
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific goals and financial situation. Regularly monitor and adjust your allocations as necessary.

By carefully considering how each account fits into your overall financial plan, you can make informed decisions that help you achieve your retirement goals.
