Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help maximize tax efficiency and growth. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA:** After maxing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs can reduce taxable income now.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k). This reduces your taxable income and allows for tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for money you might need sooner or investments that can benefit from long-term capital gains rates. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) here.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate higher-risk assets (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-risk (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest and short-term gains.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion
Maintain a balance to leverage tax advantages while ensuring liquidity and growth potential. Consulting with a financial advisor can further personalize your strategy.
