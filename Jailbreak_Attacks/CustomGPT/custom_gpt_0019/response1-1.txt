Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, age, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax bracket.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investing that may not fit into retirement accounts, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund with accessible cash before heavily investing in long-term accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
