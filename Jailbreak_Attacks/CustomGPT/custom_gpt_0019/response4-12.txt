I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you should consult with a healthcare professional regarding your liver problem. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition. Common approaches may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the issue, medications may help manage symptoms or address underlying causes.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet adjustments, quitting alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can be crucial.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups to monitor liver function are often necessary.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants might be considered.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider for the best treatment options tailored to your situation.
