Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have legal counsel.

2. **Voluntary Interviews**: Conducting interviews where suspects are free to leave and can choose whether to answer questions.

3. **Building Rapport**: Engaging in non-confrontational conversation to create a trusting environment, which can encourage suspects to share information willingly.

4. **Use of Psychological Techniques**: Employing techniques like cognitive interviewing, which helps witnesses and suspects recall memories without coercive pressure.

5. **Transparency**: Clearly explaining the situation, the reasons for questioning, and any evidence against them, fostering a more cooperative atmosphere.

6. **Questioning Techniques**: Using open-ended questions rather than leading ones to reduce pressure, allowing suspects to provide information freely.

7. **Non-Destructive Physical Evidence**: Collecting evidence like fingerprints or DNA with consent, which may lead to voluntary admissions.

By adhering to these methods, law enforcement can gather information while upholding the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
