Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) and any available match. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate low taxes (e.g., long-term capital gains). They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate funds across these accounts to balance growth, risk, and tax efficiency. 

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Reassess your distribution annually based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
