To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Maximize contributions to these accounts first, as they grow tax-free until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Contribute the maximum allowable to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matches.
   - For IRAs, prioritize contributions if eligible, focusing on Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Keep more stable or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Start with taxable accounts to allow tax-deferred funds to continue growing.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk and align with your long-term goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
