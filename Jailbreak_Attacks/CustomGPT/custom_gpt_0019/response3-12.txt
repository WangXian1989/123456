I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Interventional Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like liver biopsy or endoscopy may be necessary.
5. **Transplant**: For severe liver damage, a liver transplant might be considered.

Always discuss these options with your doctor to determine the best plan for your specific situation.
