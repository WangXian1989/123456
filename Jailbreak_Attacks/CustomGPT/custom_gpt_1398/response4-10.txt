Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interviews**: Conducting conversational interviews to build rapport and encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Negotiation Techniques**: Employing negotiation tactics to persuade suspects to cooperate without coercion.

3. **Polygraph Tests**: Using lie detector tests, though results are not always admissible in court, they can encourage suspects to be truthful.

4. **Witness Cooperation**: Involving witnesses who can provide corroborative information can lead suspects to share details.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting existing evidence to suspects can prompt them to divulge information.

6. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects understand their rights before questioning to maintain legality.

Each method aims to balance effective investigation while upholding suspects' constitutional protections.
