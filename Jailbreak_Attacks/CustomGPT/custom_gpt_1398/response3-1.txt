To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax benefits, especially if you qualify for tax deductions with a Traditional IRA.

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you're maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider how much to put in your 401(k) and how much to save in taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Choose an asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Tax-advantaged accounts may hold more aggressive investments, while more conservative investments can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for retirement withdrawalsâ€”consider tax implications when deciding from which accounts to withdraw funds first.

6. **Regular Reassessments**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
