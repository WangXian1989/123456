The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider fully funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) beyond the match, especially if you have a high earning year or your IRA limits are reached.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After that, use any extra funds for a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility and liquidity for short-term goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investments based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.

Always keep an eye on fees, tax implications, and investment performance.
