To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first, as they can provide tax deductions or tax-free growth. Aim for the employer match in a 401(k) if available.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Investment Strategy**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals for each account. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in accounts with long-term growth potential.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your retirement timeline. Withdrawals from taxable accounts are taxed as capital gains, while distributions from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as income.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk profile.
