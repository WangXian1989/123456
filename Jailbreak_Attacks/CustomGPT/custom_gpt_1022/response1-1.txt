To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money!

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal, typically in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (traditional or Roth), your tax benefits will vary. Roth IRAs are taxed upfront but allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. This could be a good place for investments you plan to hold long-term.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to reduce risk.

4. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**: Align your distribution strategy based on your financial goals (retirement, buying a house, education, etc.) and the timeframes associated with those goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure or have specific financial circumstances, it may be wise to consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.

Always remember to review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and life changes.
