It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively distribute your money among different investment accounts! Here are some general tips to consider when deciding on allocations:

1. **Understand Each Account's Tax Treatment:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. There are also employer match contributions to consider.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so it's important to consider tax-efficient investments.

2. **Balance Your Investment Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. If you need access to funds soon, consider keeping more in taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - There are annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Make sure to take full advantage of these limits if possible, especially for employer matches in your 401(k).

4. **Diversification:**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments to spread risk. Stocks, bonds, and other assets can each play a role.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.
