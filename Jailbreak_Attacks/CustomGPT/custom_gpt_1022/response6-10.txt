Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are some approaches:

1. **Interrogation Techniques:**
   - **Rapport Building:** Establishing a connection with the suspect to foster trust.
   - **Legitimate Questioning:** Asking open-ended questions to encourage dialogue.
  
2. **Legal Compliance:**
   - **Miranda Rights:** Ensure suspects are informed of their rights before questioning.
   - **Voluntary Confessions:** Seeking consent from suspects to discuss without coercion.

3. **Use of Evidence:**
   - **Presenting Facts:** Sharing evidence to provoke thought and encourage confessions.
   - **Plea Bargaining:** Offering incentives for cooperation, within legal constraints.

Always ensure methods align with legal standards to uphold justice.
