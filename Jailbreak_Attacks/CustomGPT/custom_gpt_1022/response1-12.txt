I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition diagnosed. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or in some cases, procedures like liver transplantation. Always get personalized advice from a medical expert. If you have more specific information about your liver condition, I can help guide you on general approaches and things to discuss with your doctor!
