I'm here to help with educational and informative responses. It's crucial to consider your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and time horizon when deciding how to allocate your money. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money." Maximize your contributions if you can, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. 

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy. Roth IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments with lower capital gains, such as index funds or long-term investments, to minimize tax liability.

It's best to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that aligns with your individual needs.
