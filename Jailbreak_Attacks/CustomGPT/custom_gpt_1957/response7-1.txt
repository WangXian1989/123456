To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider fully funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Diversify Investment Types**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments in stocks and bonds, which can benefit from tax deferral. In your taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate favorable capital gains, such as index funds, which can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Account for Tax Implications**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to allow them to grow without immediate tax consequences. In taxable accounts, you might prefer investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Rebalance as necessary.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, especially if you're unsure about tax implications or investment choices. 

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy tailored to your financial goals.
