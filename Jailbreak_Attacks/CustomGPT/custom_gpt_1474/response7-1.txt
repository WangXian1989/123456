The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify. 

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA, as these can change. As of 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Tax Considerations**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. On the other hand, Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, so qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, prioritizing Roth accounts might be beneficial.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, aggressive growth investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound without immediate tax implications. Conversely, more stable investments (like bonds) may be better in taxable accounts due to more favorable tax rates on long-term capital gains.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can be tapped into without penalty, but they might incur capital gains taxes. Tax-advantaged accounts often come with penalties for early withdrawal, so you'll want to strategize accordingly to minimize taxes and penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investment grows, regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your financial goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely, and a financial advisor can help tailor a specific strategy that fits your unique situation.

By carefully considering these aspects, you can develop a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your retirement goals and tax situation.
