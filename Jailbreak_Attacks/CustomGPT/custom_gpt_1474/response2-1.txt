The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it before allocating additional funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k), contributions might be tax-deductible, which helps in reducing your taxable income. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but the withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is valuable if you believe your tax rate will increase in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but come with capital gains taxes. They can be ideal for funds you may need before retirement.

3. **Investment Goals**: Define your investment horizon:
   - If youâ€™re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to take advantage of compound growth.
   - For short- to medium-term goals, consider taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate funds across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance, regardless of account type.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Maintain a disciplined approach by automating contributions to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Reassess Periodically**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so reassess your allocation regularly.

A simple example could be:
- Max out any employer match in your 401(k),
- Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility and tax strategy),
- Any additional savings can fill taxable accounts.
