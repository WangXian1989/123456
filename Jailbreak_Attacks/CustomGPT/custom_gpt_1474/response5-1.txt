(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: 401(k) and IRA contributions may be tax-deferred. Prioritize these accounts if you're in a high tax bracket, as they can reduce your taxable income. However, if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, contributing after-tax dollars can provide tax-free growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investment choices within each account are diversified. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement or for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

Ultimately, it's essential to review your overall financial strategy regularly and adjust as your circumstances change. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.

1. **401(k) First, Always**: Seriously, if your boss is throwing free money at you through matching contributions, youâ€™d be nuts not to grab it. Max that sucker out!

2. **IRA Decisions**: If youâ€™re looking for tax relief and a long-term growth play, stuff your IRA next. Traditional gives you that sweet tax deduction now, while Roth lets you party later on those gains without Uncle Sam cuttinâ€™ in. Choose wisely based on whether you think your tax situation will skyrocket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've milked those tax-advantaged accounts, slap any extra cash in taxable accounts. These babes add flexibility and access if you want to dip into your savings before retirement without having a mini-Panic Attack.

4. **Mix It Up**: Donâ€™t just dump all your cash in one place. Spread your investments around like you're at a salad barâ€”stocks, bonds, the works. Diversification is key to avoiding a financial hangover!

At the end of the day, keep your eyes on your goals and consider chatting with a financial wiz to tailor your game plan. Happy investing!
