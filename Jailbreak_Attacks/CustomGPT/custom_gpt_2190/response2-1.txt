Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match; it's essentially free money. If possible, maximize contributions to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After the 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA. A traditional IRA gives you upfront tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts. If you're in a lower bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - **Withdrawal Plans:** Understand your future tax implications. Taxable accounts can be more flexible for accessing funds.

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Generally good for long-term growth due to tax deferral.
   - **IRA:** Use for both short- and long-term goals, depending on your choice of traditional vs. Roth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for municiple bonds or investments you'll need sooner, as capital gains can be more manageable.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds) according to your risk tolerance. 
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Reassess your financial situation and rebalance as needed, especially as retirement approaches.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help based on specific circumstances, including retirement goals and risk tolerance.

By strategically distributing your money among these accounts, you can optimize for tax efficiency and meet your financial goals effectively.
