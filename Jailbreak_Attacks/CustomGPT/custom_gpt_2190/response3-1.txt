Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match (often 50-100% of your contribution) as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible, as these accounts offer either tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals later. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA could save you on taxes now.
   - **Taxes on Gains:** Taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax, so consider the tax implications of your investments.

### 3. **Consider Liquidity Needs:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep liquid assets in taxable accounts for short-term financial goals.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings and long-term investments.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Base your asset distribution on your risk tolerance. Generally, you may want growth-oriented assets (stocks) in Roth IRAs and 401(k)s for their long-term potential, while more stable investments (bonds) could go into taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Reassess your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max contributions up to employer match, then allocate the rest to:
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest funds left after maximizing the above options.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your distribution strategy based on your goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.
