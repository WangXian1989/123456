To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA if possible.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) for immediate tax benefits. If you expect to be in a lower bracket, Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) may be more advantageous.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, individuals invest more aggressively in retirement accounts since they are long-term, while using taxable accounts for short-term goals or more liquid needs.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market changes.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement, as this will impact how you might want to structure your accounts now.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
