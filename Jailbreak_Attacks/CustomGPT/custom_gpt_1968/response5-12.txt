1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modification (such as adopting a low-fat diet), regular physical activity, weight loss, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Antiviral drugs for hepatitis, steroids, and other medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and manage any complications.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Always speak with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
