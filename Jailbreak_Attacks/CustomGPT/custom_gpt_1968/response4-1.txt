To best distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts provide tax benefits. Traditional accounts offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.

2. **Employer Match**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the amount where you receive an employer match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your retirement timeline and investment goals. Long-term growth may favor stocks, while short-term needs should lean towards more stable investments.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications. Withdrawals from a 401(k) or traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a taxable account before focusing solely on retirement savings, as accessing retirement accounts early can incur penalties.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering the tax implications of each investment vehicle.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider professional advice for personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

This approach aims to maximize your retirement savings while considering the tax implications of each account type.
