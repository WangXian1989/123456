Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment objectives. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing the match and contributing to an IRA, return to your 401(k). Aim to maximize annual contributions if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts offer flexibility and liquidity but consider capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investment strategy focuses on diversification across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and aligns with your risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your portfolio and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
