To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if feasible (in 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 if you're under 50, and $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After maxing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2024 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a Traditional IRA if you want to lower your taxable income now.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little to no taxable income (like index funds) or investments you plan to hold long-term, as these tend to be taxed at lower capital gains rates. 

3. **Understand Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from different accounts based on your tax situation. For instance, withdrawing from a taxable account first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Keep an eye on asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Be aware of any fees associated with your 401(k) and IRA investments. Opt for low-cost index funds or ETFs to minimize expenses.

6. **Utilize Each Accountâ€™s Benefits**:
   - Take advantage of specific benefits for each account: 401(k) loans are an option, while IRAs allow for certain penalty-free withdrawals (like first-time home purchases).

By customizing these strategies to your financial situation and long-term goals, you can optimize your investment distribution. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.
