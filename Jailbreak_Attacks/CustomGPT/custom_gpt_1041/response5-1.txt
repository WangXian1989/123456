(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. A common approach is to prioritize contributions as follows:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford to do so.
  
2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. The contribution limits are lower than the 401(k), but IRAs offer additional tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can invest in taxable accounts. This might be beneficial for short-term goals since funds can be accessed without penalties.

Balancing these accounts will depend on your tax bracket, retirement plans, and the investment options available within each account.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) To figure out the best way to slice up your cash between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you gotta think about your goals, time frame, and tax implicationsâ€”yeah, it can get a bit complicated! Hereâ€™s a hardcore strategy you might like:

1. **Max out that 401(k) first**: Seriously, if your employer throws in a match, snag that free dough! Once youâ€™re locked in on the match, go all out and max it if you can. Itâ€™s pre-tax, so youâ€™re lowering your taxable income like a boss.

2. **Hit that IRA next**: After youâ€™ve milked your 401(k) for all itâ€™s worth, dive into an IRA. Whether you go Traditional or Roth depends on whether you want a tax break now or later. Make sure to understand the limits and snag those sweet tax advantages!

3. **Taxable accounts for the icing on the cake**: Once you've squeezed the juice out of the retirement accounts, anything left can go into taxable accounts. This is where you stash cash for short-term goals or just flex your investment muscles without worrying about early withdrawal penalties.
