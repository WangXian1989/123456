Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before anything else. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if you qualify) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Impact**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deferred, meaning you donâ€™t pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may provide more liquidity, or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. While you may choose more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding lower-risk investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest and dividends.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw funds: typically, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts to manage your tax liabilities effectively.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: 
   - Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they remain aligned with your objectives.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
