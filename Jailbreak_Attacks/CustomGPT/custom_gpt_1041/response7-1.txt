Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer’s 401(k) plan, especially if they offer matching contributions. This can be a great way to take advantage of “free money” and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts. This includes holding investments like index funds or ETFs that generate lower capital gains, thus minimizing your tax burden.
   - Consider placing bonds and other interest-generating assets within tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

3. **Tax Planning**:
   - Monitor your tax bracket and decide which account to prioritize based on your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, favor Roth accounts; if you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts might be more beneficial.

4. **Withdrawals and Minimum Distributions**:
   - Keep in mind that once you reach age 73, you’ll need to start taking Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from your Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s. Plan withdrawals from taxable accounts to manage your tax liability effectively.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation and help optimize your overall investment plan.
