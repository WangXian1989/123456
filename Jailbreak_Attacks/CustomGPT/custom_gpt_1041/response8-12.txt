It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver health.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a treatment plan tailored to your situation.
