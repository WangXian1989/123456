Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) for contributions and withdrawals. If you qualify for tax-deductible contributions, consider maxing this out next.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and liquidity, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits. Use these for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks might be suitable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or cash might be more appropriate in a taxable account to minimize taxable income.

4. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to work with a financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your situation, goals, and the current tax landscape.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary, especially as you approach retirement or your financial goals change.

Creating a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals will help you maximize your returns while minimizing tax impacts.
