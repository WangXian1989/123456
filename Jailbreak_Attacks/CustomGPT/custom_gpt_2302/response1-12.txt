I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help track liver function and detect any changes.

4. **Weight Management:** For conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, losing weight can help reduce fat in the liver.

5. **Avoiding Toxins:** Limiting exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications and chemicals, can protect liver health.

Consulting with a healthcare provider is crucial for figuring out the right treatment plan based on your condition.
