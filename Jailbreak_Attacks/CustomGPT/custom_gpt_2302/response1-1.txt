When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies: 

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. 

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Higher-risk investments may be better suited for long-term accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) since they have more time to recover from market fluctuations.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Funds in a taxable account are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale. Therefore, placing lower-yield investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts and higher-yield investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts can optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and consider paying off high-interest debt before aggressively investing.

6. **Review Periodically**: Your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change, so regularly review and adjust your allocations as necessary. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance based on your personal circumstances.
