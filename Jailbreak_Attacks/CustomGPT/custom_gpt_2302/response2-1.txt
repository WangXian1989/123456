When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be taken into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that free money before considering other accounts.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferrals or tax-free growth, depending on the type of account. Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs reduce taxable income now, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Brackets:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts for tax-free growth. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be better.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Balancing your portfolio across these accounts can help manage risk and return. Ensure that your investments reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for savings goals that require access to funds before retirement. Investments in these accounts can also provide capital gains, dividends, and interest that may be taxed at a lower rate than your ordinary income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations in each account based on performance and any changes to your financial situation or goals.

It's always recommended to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.
