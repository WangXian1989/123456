Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're close to retirement, a traditional IRA might be more suitable for tax deferral.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for your higher-growth investments, as they can compound more effectively without the tax burden.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on a diversified portfolio with a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** For investments in these accounts, choose tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 4. **Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you're younger and have a longer time until retirement, focus more on growth in your 401(k) and IRA. As retirement approaches, consider shifting towards more conservative investments.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It might be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific circumstances and objectives.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money effectively among your accounts.
