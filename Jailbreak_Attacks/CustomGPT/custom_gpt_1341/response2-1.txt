Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction now.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are beneficial for short-term goals or funds you'll need before retirement. Gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which can be lower than ordinary income rates. 
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diverse investment strategy across all accounts. This can help manage risk and align with your investment horizon.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a liquid emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific needs and circumstances.

### Sample Allocation Strategy: 
- **401(k):** Max out up to employer match, then contribute if space allows.
- **IRA:** Contribute annually to get the full benefit (if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for additional saving/investing after maxing other accounts.

Adjust this based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and retirement timeline.
