Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.
   - **IRA**: After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond your tax-advantaged accounts. This allows more flexibility for access to funds without penalties.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can offer tax advantages on capital gains, especially if you hold investments long-term.

3. **Adjust Based on Retirement Goals**:
   - If retirement is years away, focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you near retirement, consider shifting funds into safer investments, particularly in tax-deferred accounts, to minimize risk.

4. **Review Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments within each account according to your risk tolerance.
   - Balance growth-oriented investments (stocks) with more stable assets (bonds) based on your age and risk comfort.

5. **Emergency Fund and Debt Management**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before maximizing contributions.
   - Pay down high-interest debt first, which can often provide a better return than investments.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and allocations.
   - Adjust contributions based on life changes (job changes, family needs, etc.).

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
