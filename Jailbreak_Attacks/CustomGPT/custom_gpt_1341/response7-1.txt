The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Short-term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement. Ensure these investments are in tax-efficient vehicles, like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **High Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Consider holding higher-growth investments, like stocks, in your 401(k) and IRAs to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income-Generating Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Consider bonds and other income-producing investments in taxable accounts, as these may be taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal circumstances vary greatly. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that best fits your overall financial plan.

By following this structured approach, you can optimize your investments across different account types to align with your long-term financial goals.
