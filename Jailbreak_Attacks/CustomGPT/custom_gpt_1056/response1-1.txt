Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) since these accounts provide tax advantages. 

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) beyond the match limit if you have additional funds. This helps reduce your taxable income and grow your investments tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might be less tax-efficient, such as mutual funds or stocks you plan to hold for a shorter duration. They can also be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation fits your risk tolerance and investment timeline. For long-term growth, a higher percentage should be allocated to stocks, while more conservative investments (like bonds) might be better for short-term goals.

6. **Annual Review**: Regularly review your allocation as your financial situation changes, ensuring you’re on track to meet your goals.

Consider discussing your strategy with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific situation.
