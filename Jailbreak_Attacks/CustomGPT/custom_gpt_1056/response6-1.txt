Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Suitable for those in higher tax brackets now; you pay taxes on withdrawals later, potentially at a lower rate.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts Strategically**:
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Look for index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.
   - **Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains by selling losing investments to reduce your tax bill.

### 4. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**:
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term needs**: Align your accounts based on when you might need the funds. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs, while long-term goals can be funded through tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Summary
- Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Take into account your current and projected tax situation.
- Strategically use taxable accounts for short-term needs and tax efficiency.

Reviewing your strategy regularly and consulting with a financial advisor can further help optimize your investment approach.
