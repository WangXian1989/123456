When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to think about your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often comes with employer matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to receive the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. The order can depend on your specific tax situation:
     - **Traditional 401(k) & Traditional IRA:** Consider contributing here if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
     - **Roth 401(k) & Roth IRA:** Choose these if you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, younger investors may take on more risk, while those closer to retirement may shift towards safer investments.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term savings goals or for investments you might want to access before retirement age without penalties.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and life events (like marriage, home purchase, or children).

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're uncertain, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your unique financial situation and long-term goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out employer match (e.g., 6% of salary).
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds here for flexibility and diversification.

By considering these factors and strategically distributing your funds, you can effectively prepare for your financial future.
