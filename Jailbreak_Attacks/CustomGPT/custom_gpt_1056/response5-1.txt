Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first â€” it's essentially free money. Generally, try to max out contributions if possible, especially if you can benefit from pre-tax contributions.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need access to before retirement or for short-term goals. Since investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, consider holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower rates.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **First, fund your 401(k)** to the match limit.
- **Next, contribute to an IRA**, prioritizing a Roth if eligible.
- **Finally, allocate any additional savings into taxable accounts** for flexibility.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your specific situation.
