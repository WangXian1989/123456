To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For 2023, these include:
   - 401(k): Up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50).
   - IRA: Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, delaying taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest with a focus on capital gains and qualified dividends to manage tax impact.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - Short-term needs: Prefer taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Long-term growth: Prioritize retirement accounts to benefit from compounding.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investments based on risk tolerance:
   - Stocks for growth in long-term accounts.
   - Bonds for stability in more immediate needs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider getting personalized advice based on your overall financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals.

This approach balances immediate financial needs with long-term growth potential while maximizing tax efficiency.
