Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to its maximum allowable limit. This can provide tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities on dividends and interest.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances is also a good idea!
