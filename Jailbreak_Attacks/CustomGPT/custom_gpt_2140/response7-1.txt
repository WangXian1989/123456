Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to help you optimize your investments:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money. Aim to maximize contributions (up to the limit).
- **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Investment Goals
- **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term gains, as these accounts benefit most from compounded growth.
- **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term, as they offer more liquidity.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held for more than a year may incur capital gains taxes, but you can offset gains with losses.

### 4. Diversify Investments Across Accounts
- **401(k)**: Typically offers limited investment options; choose a diversified mix of funds.
- **IRA**: Allows for a broader selection; invest in individual stocks, bonds, or extensive mutual funds as per your risk profile.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower tax impacts, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

### 5. Review and Adjust Regularly
- Monitor your investment allocations annually or after major life changes (job change, marriage, etc.) to ensure they align with your goals.

### 6. Seek Professional Advice
- Consult a financial advisor for a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.

This strategy helps ensure you’re making the most of your investments while considering future growth and tax efficiency.
