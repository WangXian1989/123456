Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money!). Consider the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** After maxing the 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future goals.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Growth is tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** Similar tax treatment as 401(k) but check for income limits on Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold, but you can access funds without penalties.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Hold more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for tax-free growth.
   - Keep conservative investments (bonds, cash) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact on interest income.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan when you’ll need access to funds. Use taxable accounts first for short-term needs. Withdraw from retirement accounts as needed, accounting for taxes and penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance and Review:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions. Adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market performance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor a plan based on your unique circumstances.

By using this structured approach, you can effectively distribute your money across different accounts to maximize growth and minimize taxes.
