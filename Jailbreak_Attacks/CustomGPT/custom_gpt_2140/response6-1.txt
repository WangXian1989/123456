The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and the investment grows tax-deferred.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer the flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be used for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Suitable for investments that yield capital gains, like stocks, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts.
- **Priority Order**:
   1. **Max out employer match on 401(k)**
   2. **Contribute to Roth IRA if eligible**
   3. **Increase contributions to 401(k) or Traditional IRA**
   4. **Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility**

### **Conclusion**
- Tailor your contribution strategy based on your current tax situation and future expectations.
- Regularly review and adjust as necessary due to changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to align your investments with your specific financial situation.
