To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred, often with matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Individual retirement accounts, with different tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments subject to capital gains taxes; more flexible withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before allocating funds elsewhere.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with post-tax money; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages; however, you can manage capital gains by choosing when to sell investments.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Distribute investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Investment Horizon**
   - If youâ€™re far from retirement, consider more aggressive investments in taxable accounts for growth, while maintaining a balanced approach in retirement accounts.

### 6. **Rebalancing and Adjusting**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### 7. **Emergency Funds**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions up to employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to Roth or Traditional IRA as per your income tax bracket.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term investments.

### Conclusion
Your exact distribution will depend on personal financial goals, tax situations, and time until retirement. Consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
