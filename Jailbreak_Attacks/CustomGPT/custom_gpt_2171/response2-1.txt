Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals**: How much do you need for retirement? Plan for desired lifestyle and expenses.
   - **Time Horizon**: Determine how long you have until you need to access these funds.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially "free" money.
     - Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - Consider the income limits and tax implications of each type.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and diversify investments across accounts.
   - Consider equities for growth in long-term accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Use the taxable account for investments that generate high taxes (like bonds), which can be more tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (2023) plus catch-up contributions for those 50+.
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (2023) plus catch-up for those 50+.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement for tax efficiency.
   - Generally, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first in early retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Review your asset allocation regularly and adjust based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **Max out 401(k)** to the employer match.
- **Next, contribute to an IRA** if eligible.
- **Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts** while considering liquidity needs.

### Conclusion
A well-rounded approach that balances tax efficiency, diversification, and alignment with your goals is key. If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy.
