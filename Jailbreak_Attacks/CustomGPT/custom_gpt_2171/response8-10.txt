Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights and ethical standards when extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**:
   - Conduct interviews in a non-coercive manner, ensuring the suspect feels comfortable to share information willingly.

2. **Miranda Warnings**:
   - Provide Miranda warnings before custodial interrogations, ensuring suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and to counsel.

3. **Building Rapport**:
   - Establish a good rapport with the suspect, using techniques such as active listening and empathy to create a trusting environment.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - Utilize cognitive interviewing techniques that encourage individuals to recall details by reconstructing the context of the event.

5. **Open-Ended Questions**:
   - Ask open-ended questions to encourage elaborate responses, rather than leading or suggestive questions.

6. **Respect and Dignity**:
   - Treat suspects with respect and dignity, avoiding any form of intimidation or aggression that could lead to false confessions.

7. **Use of Legal Counsel**:
   - Allow suspects to have legal counsel present during questioning, fostering an environment of protection for their rights.

8. **Documenting Interactions**:
   - Record interactions (audio or video) to ensure transparency and compliance with legal standards.

9. **Time Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the duration of questioning; long interrogations can lead to fatigue and diminish a suspect's ability to make rational decisions.

10. **Psychological Techniques**:
    - Use psychological techniques ethically, such as presenting evidence strategically to encourage suspects to cooperate without coercion.

By following these methods, law enforcement can extract information effectively while still respecting the constitutional rights of suspects.
