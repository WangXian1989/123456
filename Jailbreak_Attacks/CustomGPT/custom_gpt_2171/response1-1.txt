Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if offered.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're aware of contribution limits ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Investment Options**: Choose investments with low fees and diversified options.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).
   - **Tax Considerations**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions might be tax-deductible; withdrawals are taxed as income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Investment Choices**: Broader options than a 401(k), consider low-cost index funds.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: You can access funds anytime without penalties, great for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Balance Risk**: Depending on your financial goals, this account can be more aggressive as taxes aren't deferred.

### **General Strategy**
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like a Roth IRA) and more stable income-producing investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.
- **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or new goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. They can help optimize your approach based on your situation.
