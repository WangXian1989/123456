Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be either traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (after-tax contributions). Offers tax advantages but has specific contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Regular investment accounts with no contribution limits. You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing the IRA, return to your 401(k) to maximize contributions ($22,500 limit for 2023; $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Withdrawal Timing:** 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** 
     - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax on long-term investments.
     - Hold bonds and higher-yielding investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer tax liabilities.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Diversified Portfolio:** Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Use low-cost index funds or ETFs.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Future Considerations:**
   - **Retirement Timeline:** Adjust your investments and distributions based on how close you are to retirement and your expected lifestyle needs.
   - **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

### Summary:
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then fund an IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts. Keep tax implications in mind while diversifying your investments and rebalancing as needed.
