To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Take full advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable limit if possible.

2. **Utilize IRA Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to earlier or want more control over (like individual stocks). Be mindful of tax implications from capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, stocks for growth in retirement accounts and bonds in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
