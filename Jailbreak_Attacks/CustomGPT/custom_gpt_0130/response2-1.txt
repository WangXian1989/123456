When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matches and pre-tax contributions to lower your taxable income.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer upfront tax deductions.

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maxing out employer matches in your 401(k), consider balancing contributions between a traditional IRA and your taxable accounts based on your tax situation.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in your taxable account for liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments (stocks) and bonds in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

5. **Consider Taxes**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts when selling investments.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
