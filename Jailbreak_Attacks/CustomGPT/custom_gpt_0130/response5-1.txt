Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it’s essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Put higher growth, higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - More stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where interest is taxed as ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, international) across all accounts to balance risk and return.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 5. **Financial Goals**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (down payment on a house, etc.) and retirement accounts for long-term goals.
