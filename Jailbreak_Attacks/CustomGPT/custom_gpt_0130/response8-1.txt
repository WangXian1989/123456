Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Consider maxing contributions if feasible.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Treatment**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you know your annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for IRAs in 2023; $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Good for short-term goals or emergencies due to no penalties for withdrawal.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- Prioritize getting the employer match in your 401(k).
- Max out your IRA contributions next (considering your tax situation).
- Allocate any remaining funds into your taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Investment Goals**: Align your distribution based on your retirement timeline and financial goals.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Balance your portfolio according to your comfort with market fluctuations.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and objectives. 

This strategy maximizes both tax efficiency and flexibility, helping you grow your investments over time.
