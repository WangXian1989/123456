To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contribution; this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, focus on your IRA (Roth or Traditional) to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

3. **Account Characteristics**:
   - Use your 401(k) for higher contribution limits and potential loans.
   - Use your IRA for investments with high growth potential, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for more liquid investments and those that may not be as tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep higher-risk investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where gains can grow tax-free.
   - Hold bonds and lower-risk investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and the potential tax implications when withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds effectively. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
