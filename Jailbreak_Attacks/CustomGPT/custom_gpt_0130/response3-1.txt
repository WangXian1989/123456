Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once you've maximized your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if it has good investment options and low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment beyond retirement accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Stocks usually go in taxable accounts for their favorable tax treatment, while bonds can be better in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations and rebalance as needed to ensure they align with your investment goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.

This strategy helps optimize tax efficiency and growth potential.
