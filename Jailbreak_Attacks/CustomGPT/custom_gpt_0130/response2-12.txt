I'm not a doctor, but here are some common approaches for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or slow progression.

3. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may benefit from supplements or herbal remedies, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment tailored to your condition.
