Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on withdrawals.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Ideal for short-term goals or when you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to spread risk and align with your investment strategy.

4. **Adjust for Time Horizon**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, consider a more conservative allocation in your 401(k) and IRA. For younger investors, a higher equity concentration can yield greater long-term growth.

5. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in market conditions, personal circumstances, and tax laws.

By strategically allocating your investments based on these factors, you can optimize your growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
