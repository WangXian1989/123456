To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider the Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth IRA**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now. It's beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain conditions. This is ideal if you believe your tax rate will increase.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Invest money you might need within the next five years, as these accounts provide easier access to your funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider placing high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on gains.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Adjust your contributions and investment allocation annually based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRA during retirement are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Monitor your taxable accounts for capital gains taxes and utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

Following these strategies can help maximize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
