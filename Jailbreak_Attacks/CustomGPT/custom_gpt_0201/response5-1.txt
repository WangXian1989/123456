To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, aim to max out your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Higher Tax Bracket**: Focus on pre-tax accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income now.
   - **Lower Tax Bracket**: Consider Roth options for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Balance for Flexibility**
   - Leave some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity, as they allow for withdrawals without penalties or required minimum distributions (RMDs).

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Utilize tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold bonds and other interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on market performance, changes in tax laws, and shifts in your financial goals.

By strategically distributing your money, you can optimize for growth while minimizing taxes over time. It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
