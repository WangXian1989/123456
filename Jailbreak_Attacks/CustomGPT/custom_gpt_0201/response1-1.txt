To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this first.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and withdrawal preferences.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, try to increase contributions to your IRA.
   - If you can afford to, continue contributing to the 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement, such as an emergency fund or short-term goals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Adjust your contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, prioritizing traditional accounts may be beneficial.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

This balanced approach considers growth potential, tax implications, and your liquidity needs.
