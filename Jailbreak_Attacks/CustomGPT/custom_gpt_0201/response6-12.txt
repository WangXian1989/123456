I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopting a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance:** Stopping alcohol consumption to prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, medications like tenofovir or entecavir may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids:** To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Check-Ups:** Regular liver function tests to monitor health status.
   - **Imaging:** Ultrasounds or CT scans to assess liver condition.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
