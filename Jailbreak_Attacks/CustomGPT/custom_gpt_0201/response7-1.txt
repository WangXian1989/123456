To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might be beneficial for tax deductions.

2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments that may generate short-term gains or interest, which are taxed as ordinary income. These accounts can also hold assets that might be less tax-efficient in retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider the types of investments in each account. For example, hold higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth. In taxable accounts, favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Age Considerations:**
   - The younger you are, the more you might lean towards growth-oriented investments; as you approach retirement, prioritize income-generating assets.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your specific situation, risk tolerance, and goals.

Following these guidelines can help optimize your investment strategy across different account types for better long-term financial health.
