Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. Consider the tax benefits of pre-tax contributions.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (like long-term investments) or hold tax-efficient funds.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth options (stocks, ETFs).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Balance growth investments with income-generating ones to manage taxes effectively.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds to minimize tax liabilities in retirement.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Maintain liquidity for immediate needs outside these accounts.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized strategies can enhance your financial outcomes.

This structure can help maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
