Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match—it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments needing liquidity or for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Placement**:
     - Place high-growth investments with potential capital gains in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - Consider holding bonds and income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxable income.

### 3. **Align with Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Horizon**: For long-term goals, maximize investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: If you anticipate needing funds soon, prioritize taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.
   - Ensure a balanced approach that aligns with your overall financial strategy.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

### Summary
1. Max out your 401(k) to get the employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA/Roth IRA.
3. Use taxable accounts for investments needing liquidity.
4. Diversify within and across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and goals.
