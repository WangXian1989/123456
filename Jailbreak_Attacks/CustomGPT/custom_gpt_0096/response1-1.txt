To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing the maximum to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Reserve high-growth investments for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - In high-income years, prioritize pre-tax accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to lower your taxable income.
   - In lower-income years, consider Roth contributions for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider tax implications of withdrawals in retirementâ€”withdraw from accounts in a way that keeps you in lower tax brackets.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
