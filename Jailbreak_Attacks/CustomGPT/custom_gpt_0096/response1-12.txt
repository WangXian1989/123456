I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver issues typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or slow progression.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function.
4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
