To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **401(k)**: This is often a great place to begin, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: If you’re eligible, maxing out an IRA (Roth or Traditional) can be beneficial. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and can be beneficial for those looking to access funds before retirement age without penalties.

**General Guidelines**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment strategy based on your age and comfort with market fluctuations. Younger investors can often take on more risk, while those closer to retirement may favor more conservative investments.
- **Diversification**: Consider diversifying across asset classes—stocks, bonds, real estate—to minimize risk.
  
It’s wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation, goals, and timeline.
