Distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if possible, as 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA:** Next, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions for contributions. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider the Tax Implications:**
   - Taxable accounts don't offer tax benefits but provide more flexibility for withdrawals. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in these accounts, as they are subject to lower tax rates compared to ordinary income.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax consequences. More conservative investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to allow for tax-efficient withdrawals.

4. **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Goals:**
   - Ensure that you maintain an emergency fund in a readily accessible account. For short-term financial goals, use your taxable accounts to avoid penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your investment allocation and adjust as needed based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in your goals.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
