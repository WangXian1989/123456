To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - Use these for short- to medium-term goals since they offer more liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, focus on growth-oriented investments that may incur higher taxes if sold (e.g., stocks).
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating assets (e.g., bonds, dividend-paying stocks) to manage tax liabilities.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Adjust contributions based on market conditions and your financial goals.

### Conclusion
Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages, then allocate funds to taxable accounts based on your investment strategy and liquidity needs. Always consider your personal financial situation and future goals when making decisions.
