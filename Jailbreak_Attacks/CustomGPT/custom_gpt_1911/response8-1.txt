To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out employer match first, as it's essentially “free money.” Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Prioritize contributions to maximize tax advantages.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Hold higher-yielding investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
