To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer contributions (if available).
   - Focus on pre-tax contributions, as they reduce your taxable income now.
   - Invest in a diversified mix of assets that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Depending on your income level, consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - Like your 401(k), choose investments based on your risk tolerance (stocks for long-term growth, bonds for stability).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) or income that may be taxed more favorably, such as qualified dividends.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains with losses.
   - Keep more fixed-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Evaluate your overall asset allocation across all accounts, ensuring you're not overexposed in any single area.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy as you approach retirement, considering the tax implications of withdrawing from different accounts in retirement.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals. Regularly review and adjust your investment strategy as life circumstances change and markets fluctuate.
