Hey there! ðŸ˜Š Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can really depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to capture that full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money!

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Next, consider funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and preferences). IRAs often have a wider variety of investment options compared to typical 401(k) plans.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After that, if you have additional funds, go back to your 401(k) and maximize contributions up to the limit if you can.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer flexibility with no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Investment Strategies**: In taxable accounts, look for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, which may generate fewer taxable events.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Remember, these are general suggestions, and it might be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy fitting your unique circumstances. Happy investing! ðŸ’°
