When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it really depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)), which can lower your taxable income now, or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), if offered, which can be tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribute to the Max**: If your budget allows, contribute as much as you can afford, up to the annual limit.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Consider your current versus expected future tax rate. A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind that IRAs have lower contribution limits compared to 401(k)s, so factor that into your budgeting.
   - **Diversification**: An IRA can be a good place to diversify your investments compared to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts give you quick access to your money without penalties, which can be beneficial for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of short-term vs. long-term capital gains tax rates; long-term gains (investments held for over a year) are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: You have more flexibility in choosing investments and can implement tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before aggressively investing.
- **Tax Considerations**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) before taxable accounts, especially if there are matching contributions or tax deductions.
- **Goal-Based Allocation**: Consider your time horizonâ€”long-term savings can be more aggressive, while near-term goals should be more conservative.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific situation. ðŸ’°
