Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing this out if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Follow up with contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you’ve optimized your tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance. Typically, you might want more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how and when you plan to access these funds, as different accounts have different tax implications upon withdrawal.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy and adjust based on your changing circumstances and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
