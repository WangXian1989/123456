Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Consider High Contributions**: If you're in your 30s or 40s, try to contribute as much as you can, since contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: A Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income, while a Roth IRA grows tax-free. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Max out your contributions if possible, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Short-Term Goals**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on long-term investments, such as stocks or ETFs, to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have enough in savings to cover 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation as life circumstances change.

### Tax Considerations:
- Withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts in accordance with tax implications.
- Consider your investment horizon; longer time frames can favor riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Professional Advice:
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

This approach helps ensure you're maximizing growth while managing risk and taxes effectively.
