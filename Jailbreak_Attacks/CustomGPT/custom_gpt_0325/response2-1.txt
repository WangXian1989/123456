When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: If you can, contribute enough to get the match, then consider increasing contributions.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, either traditional or Roth IRAs can provide tax benefits. Roth contributions grow tax-free, while traditional contributions may lower your taxable income now.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account for unexpected expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset mix.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized approach based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance can provide the best strategy.

Implementing these strategies can help you maximize growth while managing your tax liability effectively.
