Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your income level, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals with a shorter time horizon and be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.
   - Allocate assets based on time horizon, risk tolerance, and income needs.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion
- Balancing contributions while considering tax efficiency can optimize your overall financial strategy. Each account type serves different purposes, so tailor your contributions accordingly.
