Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach you may consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum if your employer match is available. Consider the plan’s fees and investment options.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for investment beyond retirement funds. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) outside these retirement accounts for unexpected costs.

5. **Diversification**: Invest in a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and growth.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually based on your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
