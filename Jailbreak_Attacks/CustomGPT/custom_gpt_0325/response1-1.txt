Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors like your current financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for extra savings or investment once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. This is also good for short-term goals since you can access the money without penalties.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. For instance, you might want to keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Rebalance your portfolio as needed based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation!
