Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Allocation**:
   - Consider the tax implications of each account. Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains tax, while tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRAs) will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For longer-term investments, you might prioritize contributions to accounts with tax benefits.
   - Shorter-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, where you have easier access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Review Contributions Annually**:
   - Reassess your financial situation and investment performance regularly. Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

6. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses without dipping into your retirement savings.

7. **Professional Advice**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations, especially if your situation is complex or you're nearing retirement.

By thoughtfully distributing your contributions across these accounts, you can optimize your tax advantages and align your investments with your financial goals.
