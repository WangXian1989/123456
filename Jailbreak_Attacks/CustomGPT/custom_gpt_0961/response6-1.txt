To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Assess Tax Implications
- **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as a 401(k), while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on profits when sold.

### 2. Maximize Employer Matches
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **401(k)**: Often offers limited investment choices. Focus on a mix of equities and bonds.
- **IRA**: Open a broader range of investment options (stocks, bonds, ETFs).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 4. Determine Your Time Horizon
- Longer-term investments should be more aggressive. A 401(k) and IRA generally suit long-term growth; taxable accounts may align with shorter-term goals.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
- Annually assess your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 20% of total assets (maximize match)
- **IRA**: 40% of total assets (focus on growth investments)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40% of total assets (diversify with tax-efficient options)

### Final Considerations
- Monitor changes in tax laws and personal financial situations that might affect your distribution strategy.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
