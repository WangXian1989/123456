Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, the tax treatment varies. Traditional IRAs may allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Understand that capital gains and dividends might be taxed, which can affect your net returns. Keeping investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) can be beneficial.

### 3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - After maxing out any employer match, consider funding your IRA. If you qualify, consider making contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth and higher-risk investments since you won’t be taxed on them until withdrawal (for traditional) or ever (for Roth).
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or those you may need access to sooner.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid pulling funds from tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Adjust as You Age**
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting toward more conservative investments and taking less risk, particularly in your taxable accounts.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income until you hit the employer match limit.
- **IRA**: 10-15% of your income, depending on your ability to contribute and income limits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate additional funds after maximizing retirement contributions.

### Regular Review
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation. They can provide personalized advice considering your complete financial picture.
