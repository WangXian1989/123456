Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of considerations for each:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Use for Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **Investment Options**: Depending on your plan, you might have a limited selection of investments. Diversify within those options.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Strategically Fund**: If you can, max out Roth IRA contributions first for long-term tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts is more accessible without penalties for withdrawals.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for favorable tax treatment.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Consider using these accounts for your emergency savings due to their liquidity.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Begin by contributing to your 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to an IRA. After those are maximized, invest in your taxable account.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of your tax situation each year. Adjust contributions based on your current income and future expectations.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (up to the match).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 per year or $7,500 if you're over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining savings after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts.
