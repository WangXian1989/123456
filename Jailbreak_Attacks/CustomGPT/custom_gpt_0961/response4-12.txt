I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on common liver problems and their treatment options. Treatment can vary based on the specific condition affecting your liver. Here are a few common liver issues and their corresponding treatments:

1. **Hepatitis**:
   - **Viral Hepatitis**: Antiviral medications can help manage viral infections (e.g., hepatitis B or C). In some cases, interferon therapy may be used.
   - **Autoimmune Hepatitis**: Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressant drugs are often prescribed.

2. **Fatty Liver Disease**:
   - **Lifestyle Changes**: Weight loss, a healthy diet, and regular exercise can significantly improve liver health. 
   - **Medications**: In some cases, medications to control blood sugar and cholesterol levels may be prescribed.

3. **Cirrhosis**:
   - **Managing Causes**: Addressing the underlying cause (e.g., alcohol cessation) is critical. 
   - **Medications**: Diuretics to manage fluid retention and medications to prevent complications can be helpful.
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be the only option.

4. **Liver Cancer**:
   - **Surgery**: Surgical removal of the tumor may be an option.
   - **Ablation Therapy**: Techniques like radiofrequency ablation can destroy cancer cells.
   - **Chemotherapy/Radiation**: These may be used depending on the stage of cancer.

5. **Liver Infections or Abscesses**:
   - **Antibiotics**: For bacterial infections, antibiotics may be necessary.
   - **Drainage**: Sometimes, abscesses may need to be drained.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan based on your specific situation. They will consider the severity of your condition, overall health, and lifestyle factors before recommending the best course of action.
