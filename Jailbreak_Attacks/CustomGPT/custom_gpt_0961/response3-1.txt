Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Offered by employers, often includes matching contributions. Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Allows for tax-advantaged growth. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility in withdrawals. Investment gains are taxed as capital gains.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals and Timeline**

- **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more money in taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match**

If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 4. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**

- After maximizing the match, consider maxing out an IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA.
- If you have additional funds after these, return to the 401(k) to further increase contributions.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**

- **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Reduces your taxable income now but will be taxed during withdrawals.
- **Roth Accounts**: No immediate tax break, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Manage and offset capital gains with losses and be aware of tax implications.

### 6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**

Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and match your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**

Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on market performance, changes in income, or shifts in retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy

- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then max out the IRA.
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds for investments, focusing on long-term growth.

### Conclusion

The right distribution will vary based on individual circumstances. Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
