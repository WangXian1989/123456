Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your individual financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are not tax-advantaged but provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties. 

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you are eligible for deductions. 
   - If you reach the contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio within each account to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help manage your tax bracket.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances.
