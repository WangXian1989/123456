When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key strategies:

### 1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 (2024 limit), plus $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50.
     - **IRA:** $6,500 (2024 limit), with a $1,000 catch-up if you're over 50.

### 3. **Emergency Funds:**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside of retirement accounts for emergencies.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider a mix of assets based on your risk tolerance. Typically, more aggressive investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential:
     - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds).
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for more conservative assets or investments that produce income (bonds, dividend stocks) to manage tax implications.

### 5. **Withdrawal Plans:**
   - Plan ahead for withdrawals. Consider future tax implications and your expected income at retirement.

### 6. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 7. **Professional Guidance:**
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, goals, and tax situation.

### Example Allocation:
- Max out your 401(k) to get the match.
- Contribute to your IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if eligible.
- Allocate any additional savings to your taxable account, focusing on investments that align with your goals.

This balanced approach maximizes tax efficiency and prepares you for retirement effectively.
