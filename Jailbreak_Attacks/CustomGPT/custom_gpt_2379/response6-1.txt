Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some tips to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA can reduce your taxable income. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than income.

### 3. **Investment Growth Potential**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Suitable for long-term growth; consider higher-risk investments for potentially better returns.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate cash or more stable investments here for liquidity needs.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - **Balance**: Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts to mitigate risk while optimizing returns.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your future withdrawals to minimize tax implications. Always withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow.

By evaluating your specific financial situation, goals, and future plans, you can create a strategic plan for distributing your funds effectively.
