To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Max Out Contributions**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if feasible, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Good for high income earners.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds here. Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments long-term to minimize tax impact.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Consider placing investments with the highest growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax impact on interest income.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired risk and return profile.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals during retirement carefully to minimize tax liabilities and maximize your funds.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
