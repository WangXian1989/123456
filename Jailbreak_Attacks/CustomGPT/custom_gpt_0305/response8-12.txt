1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet: Low in fat, sugar, and salt.
   - Regular exercise.
   - Avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging studies to assess liver condition.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - Liver transplant for severe liver disease.

5. **Supplements**:
