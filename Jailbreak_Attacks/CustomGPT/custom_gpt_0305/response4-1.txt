Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA and 401(k) for tax benefits. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged options.

4. **Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts due to tax-free growth, and keep lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you'll draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor may provide strategies personalized to your situation.
