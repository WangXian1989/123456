Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After matching, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limits. This reduces your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation periodically based on your age, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: When withdrawing funds in retirement, consider the tax implications of each account type.

This balanced approach prioritizes growth, tax efficiency, and maximum benefits from employer contributions.
