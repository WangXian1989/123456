To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's effectively "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Keep fixed-income investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on interest.

3. **Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on potential tax impact. For retirement, consider tax brackets when deciding which account to draw from first.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Evaluate the tax implications of each account type: Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals, whereas traditional accounts tax withdrawals as income.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to meet risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match + additional contributions.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings or funds needed for short-term goals.
