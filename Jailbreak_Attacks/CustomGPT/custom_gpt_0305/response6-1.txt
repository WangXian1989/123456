Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like tax considerations, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions if you qualify for deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with lower capital gains, such as index funds or ETFs.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan which accounts to draw from in retirement for tax efficiency.
