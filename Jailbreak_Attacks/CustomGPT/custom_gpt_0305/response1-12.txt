I'm not a doctor, but here are some common approaches for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding saturated fats, sugars, and alcohol.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and enhance liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help track liver health and manage conditions effectively.

4. **Avoid Alcohol and Toxins**: Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding exposure to toxins can help protect the liver.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
