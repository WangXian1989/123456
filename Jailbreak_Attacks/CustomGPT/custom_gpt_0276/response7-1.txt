The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. Consider Tax Benefits
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to Traditional or Roth IRAs and your 401(k) for their tax benefits (tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals).

### 3. Evaluate Your Tax Situation
- **High Current Income**: Consider a Traditional IRA/401(k) to reduce taxable income now.
- **Lower Income or Expecting Higher Future Income**: Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) might be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals later.

### 4. Diversify Investments
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds. This can help manage tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

### 5. Emergency Fund
- Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts for immediate access.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Max out 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.**
- **Contribute to IRA**: If you can, maximize contributions to both Traditional and Roth IRAs, depending on your tax situation.
- **Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts**, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Review and Adjust Annually
- Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances.
