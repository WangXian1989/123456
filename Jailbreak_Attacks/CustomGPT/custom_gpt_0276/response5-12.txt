I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat, sugars, and processed foods can be beneficial. Incorporating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is recommended.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and liver function.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferon and direct-acting antivirals may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These can help with autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Complementary Therapies**:
   - Approaches like acupuncture or herbal supplements may help some individuals but should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Make sure to talk to a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
