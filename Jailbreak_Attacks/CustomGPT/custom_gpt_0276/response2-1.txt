Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**

- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
  
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next, based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**

- **Taxable Investment Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds here. They offer liquidity and flexibility, but keep in mind capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**

- **Consider Risk Tolerance**: Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance. Stocks typically offer higher returns but come with increased risk, while bonds provide stability.

- **Diversify**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

### 4. **Consider Age and Retirement Timeline**

- **Younger Investors**: Focus more on growth investments in the stock market.
  
- **Near Retirement**: Shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**

- Monitor your allocations and adjust annually based on market conditions, life changes, and retirement goals.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**

- Depending on your situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice and optimize your strategy.

### Example Allocation:

- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum limit (e.g., $6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings after maxing out the above accounts.

### Conclusion

This distribution strategy can help you build wealth effectively while minimizing taxes. Adjust as your situation changes!
