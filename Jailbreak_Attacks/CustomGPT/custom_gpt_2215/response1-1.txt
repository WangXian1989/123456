To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can help lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **IRA Contribution Limits**: Utilize IRA contributions as they can offer tax advantages. Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having both traditional and Roth IRAs can provide flexibility in tax management during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Taxable accounts allow for easier access to funds without withdrawal penalties. Use these for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Asset Allocation**: Implement a diversified portfolio within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your asset allocation regularly to maintain your desired risk level.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions up to match.**
- **Contribute to an IRA (prioritize Roth if eligible).**
- **Use taxable accounts for additional investments and liquidity.** 

This approach balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and access to your funds.
