I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you discuss treatment options with a healthcare professional. Common approaches to liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options may be considered.

Make sure to consult a medical professional for a tailored treatment plan.
