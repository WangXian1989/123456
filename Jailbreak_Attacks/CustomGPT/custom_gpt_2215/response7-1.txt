When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA** contributions are often pre-tax (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed for traditional accounts. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Balance Risk and Return:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, more aggressive investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments (to minimize taxes on dividends and interest) can be in taxable accounts.

4. **Maintain Flexibility:**
   - Having a portion in taxable accounts allows for more liquidity without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically assess your contributions and investment performance to align with changing financial goals and market conditions.

This balanced approach helps optimize your savings, manage tax implications, and prepare for retirement effectively.
