Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, your retirement goals, and your investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match since this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if it fits into your budget, as it lowers your taxable income.

2. **IRAs**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions on contributions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Max out contributions to an IRA if you can after your 401(k), especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, as it offers significant long-term tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties and provide flexibility. Consider using these for short-term goals or investments in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs. Keep in mind that capital gains taxes apply to profits from investments in these accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, you may want to adjust how you withdraw from these accounts, balancing tax obligations and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred accounts.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized investment plan that aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.
