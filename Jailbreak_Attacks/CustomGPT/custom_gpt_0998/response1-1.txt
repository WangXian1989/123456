Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After your 401(k) match, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a good mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. Each account can hold different investments based on your strategy.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind that withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income. Taxable accounts can be more tax-efficient for short-term gains or distributions.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider your liquidity needs. Taxable accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalty, while retirement accounts have restrictions.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment distribution with your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.
