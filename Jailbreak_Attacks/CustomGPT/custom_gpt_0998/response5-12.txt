I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle changes**: This might involve adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.
3. **Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like therapeutic paracentesis (for fluid buildup) or liver transplant (in severe cases) may be necessary.
4. **Regular monitoring**: Ongoing check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and adapt the treatment as needed.

Always prioritize professional medical advice tailored to your situation.
