I'm not a doctor, but it's important that you consult with a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver problems, as treatment can vary based on the specific condition. Generally, treatment options might include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications, or in some cases, procedures such as surgery or liver transplantation. It's crucial to follow a doctor's guidance tailored to your specific situation.
