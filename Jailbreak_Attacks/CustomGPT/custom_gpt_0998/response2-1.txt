The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement. This is great for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: For funds you may need before retirement or to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes, these accounts allow for more flexibility but are subject to taxes on dividends and interest annually.

3. **Assess Your Investment Timeline**: 
   - If you’re young and have a long investment horizon, focusing on aggressive growth in your 401(k) and IRA might be beneficial. For shorter timelines, prioritize liquidity in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are appropriately diversified to manage risk.

5. **Revisit and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

It's advised to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy tailored to your specific circumstances.
