To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Itâ€™s beneficial to maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, you can take advantage of tax deferral or tax-free growth. Using a Roth can be more advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are less tax-advantaged but provide more flexibility for withdrawals. Here, you can invest in a variety of assets without penalties for early withdrawal.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your short-term and long-term goals. Retirement accounts should generally focus on long-term growth, while taxable accounts may be suitable for shorter-term needs.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall strategy.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Having a mix of account types can provide flexibility in managing your tax liability during withdrawals.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account and ensure you are maximizing available tax benefits.

6. **Consult a Professional**: 
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan to your specific situation.

Overall, a balanced approach that considers both immediate and future tax implications, along with your financial goals, will help in the effective distribution of your money across these accounts.
