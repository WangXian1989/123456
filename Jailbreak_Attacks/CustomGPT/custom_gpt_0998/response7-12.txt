I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options tailored to your specific condition. Treatment may vary based on the underlying cause of the liver issue, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes like diet modifications, medication, and in some cases, more advanced procedures. Always follow the advice of your medical provider for the best outcomes.
