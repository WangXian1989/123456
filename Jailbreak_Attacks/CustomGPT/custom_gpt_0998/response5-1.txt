(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the IRS limits), consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you might qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for money you may need in the short term or for investments that could result in favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

Make sure to review your asset allocation across all accounts and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, hereâ€™s the deal with distributing your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Think of it as a strategic game plan instead of a rigid formula. First up, max out that 401(k) if your employer offers a matchâ€”don't leave free money on the table! Next, dive into your IRA (Roth or Traditional) depending on whether you want tax-free withdrawals or tax-deductible contributions. Once you've padded those tax-advantaged accounts, then it's time to throw some cash into taxable accounts, especially if youâ€™re eyeing short-term investments or just want to keep your options open like some kind of financial ninja. And hey, always keep an eye on capital gains taxes when making moves in those taxable accounts. Happy investing!
