The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA can provide tax advantages. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth (contributions are made with after-tax dollars).

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that produce less taxable income, like index funds or tax-efficient funds. Consider holding bonds and other income-producing investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and regions, regardless of the account type.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: If you are closer to retirement, prioritize accounts that offer more immediate tax benefits, such as traditional accounts, while younger investors might lean more towards Roth accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments to maintain your desired risk level.

It’s wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.
