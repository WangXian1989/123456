I'm here to help with crafting user research interview questions. Could you clarify your objectives for the interview? What specific product or initiative are you focusing on, and how many questions do you need? Additionally, do you have a particular angle or theme in mind for the discussion with young voters? This will help me generate precise questions for your research.
