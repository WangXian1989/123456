Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these last for savings that you might need before retirement. They offer flexibility in access but lack tax advantages.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals will be taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, which can grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll pay capital gains tax on investments when you sell them.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation regularly and adjust contributions to maintain your desired risk level.

### Conclusion
Tailor these strategies to your specific situation and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
