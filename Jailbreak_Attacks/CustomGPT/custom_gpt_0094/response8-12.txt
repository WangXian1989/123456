I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications might be prescribed.

3. **Weight Management**: For conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, weight loss can help reduce fat in the liver.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help track liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
