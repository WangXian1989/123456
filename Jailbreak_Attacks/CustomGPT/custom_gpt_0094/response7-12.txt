I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain liver health and manage weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging studies.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Natural Remedies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but consult your doctor before trying these.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
