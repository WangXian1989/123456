Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, growth potential, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies:

### Key Considerations
1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar pre-tax benefits; contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax; qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts for easier access.
   - Long-term growth can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
- **Fund Retirement Accounts**: After the match, prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can use a Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Recommended Steps
- **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments (stocks vs. bonds) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Diversify Across Accounts**: Use a mix of asset types in each account to balance risk and reward. For example:
  - *401(k)*: Focus on long-term growth assets.
  - *IRA*: Consider a mix of growth and income-generating investments.
  - *Taxable*: Use lower-turnover funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

By thoughtfully distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and investment growth while managing tax liabilities.
