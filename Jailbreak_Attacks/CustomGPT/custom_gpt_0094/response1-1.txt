To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This helps you minimize your current tax burden and maximize compound growth.

3. **Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for higher contributions and potential employer matching. Consider investing in a mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax rate at withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may have a lower tax impact (like index funds or ETFs) since you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your assets are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account to reduce risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an accessible emergency fund in cash or near-cash equivalents to avoid tapping into your investments during emergencies.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If unsure, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your personal situation and goals.

By using these strategies, you can effectively manage your investments while minimizing taxes and maximizing growth potential.
