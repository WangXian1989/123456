It's important to approach investment distribution based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diversified mix of investment options available in your 401(k), focusing on your long-term growth.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, consider how you want to approach tax implications now versus in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions up to the limit if possible, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Keep funds available for short-term needs or investments that donâ€™t fit into retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors.
   - **Review Regularly**: Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation in response to market changes.

5. **Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your financial goals and situation.

Always ensure that your investments are aligned with your risk tolerance and that you have emergency savings in place.
