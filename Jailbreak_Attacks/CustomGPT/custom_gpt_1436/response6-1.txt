When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the differences and tax implications of each account type. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you make an informed decision:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. Balance Contributions Based on Your Tax Situation
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA can provide immediate tax deductions.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth options for tax-free withdrawals.

### 3. Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investment. Keep in mind:
     - Capital gains taxes on investments held over a year are generally lower than ordinary income taxes.
     - Tax-loss harvesting can offset capital gains and reduce tax liability.

### Considerations for Asset Allocation
- **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments align with your risk appetite across all accounts.
- **Investment Horizon**: Longer-term investments are generally better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to avoid short-term capital gains taxes.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
