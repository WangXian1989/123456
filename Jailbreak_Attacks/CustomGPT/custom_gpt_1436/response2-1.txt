I canâ€™t provide personalized financial advice, but I can share some general principles on asset distribution among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: First, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**: Keep in mind that IRAs and 401(k)s have specific rules regarding withdrawals. A taxable account may provide more flexibility if you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Different types of accounts can hold different types of assets. For example, consider placing higher-growth investments, which may be taxed more heavily, in tax-advantaged accounts. Conversely, more stable investments that generate income could be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of various accounts. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts might be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Diversify**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes regardless of the account type. This helps manage risk.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Because individual financial situations can vary greatly, consider speaking with a financial advisor to develop a strategy that best fits your specific needs and goals.

It's important to evaluate your own financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications when deciding on the best distribution.
