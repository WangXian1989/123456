When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about several key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, meaning you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income from these accounts is taxed in the year it is earned. Long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so consider holding investments here for over a year.

2. **Retirement Goals**: 
   - Evaluate your retirement timeline and cash flow needs. Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for long-term growth and reduce taxable account investments to minimize tax burdens.

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your 401(k) offers employer matching contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as it is essentially free money.

4. **Investment Options**: 
   - Consider the investment choices available in each account type. Some 401(k)s may have limited options, while IRAs can offer a broader range.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. 

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - Think ahead about how and when you'll withdraw money from these accounts in retirement, as this affects taxes and your overall financial strategy.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
