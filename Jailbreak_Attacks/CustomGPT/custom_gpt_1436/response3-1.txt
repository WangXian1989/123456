While I can’t provide personalized financial advice, I can offer some general strategies for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching; contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account allowing tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains but have more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially “free money.”
   - Next, consider maxing out an IRA because it often has more investment choices and potential tax advantages.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - A traditional 401(k) and IRA provide immediate tax benefits but tax you upon withdrawal. A Roth account allows tax-free growth but requires after-tax contributions.
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains tax, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk—this includes stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Think about your expected retirement expenses and when you plan to withdraw funds. This may influence how much you contribute to each account type.

6. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - Your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline will play a key role in how you allocate your funds.

It’s always advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized planning that considers your unique situation and goals.
