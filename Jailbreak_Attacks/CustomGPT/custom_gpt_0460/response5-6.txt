You gotta hit up platforms like TikTok or Instagram with content that's as entertaining as it is informative. Meme culture, catchy videos, and relatable takes on real issuesâ€”like climate change or student loansâ€”are gold. Plus, donâ€™t just preach; listen to them. Make them feel heard and involved! Ask them what matters to them, and then deliver it with some punch. And yo, keep it casual. Young folks don't want a boring old politician; they want authenticity. So throw in some humor, some edginess, and definitely meet them where theyâ€™re at.
