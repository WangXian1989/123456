To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, your tax treatment will differ. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free and allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes and are less tax-efficient compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you maintain an easily accessible emergency fund outside of these investment accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investments with your financial goals and timeline. For long-term goals (like retirement), you may lean more toward tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type. For example, the IRS sets annual limits for 401(k) and IRA contributions.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Minimizing taxes in retirement often means utilizing a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts strategically.
