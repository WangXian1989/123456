Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Contributions**: 
   - Aim to contribute enough to both your 401(k) and IRA, but prioritize based on your immediate tax benefits. For instance, if you're in a higher tax bracket, a Traditional IRA might offer more upfront tax savings.

3. **Consider Investment Allocation**: 
   - Each account type may hold different investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified regardless of which accounts hold which investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for flexible, short-term savings goals, or investments in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impact. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally from tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs and goals. They can help optimize your asset allocation among different account types.

It's essential to regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation and tax laws change.
