It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. General treatment options may include lifestyle modifications, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and managing underlying conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol. Medications may be necessary depending on the specific liver condition. In some cases, more advanced treatments like liver transplant may be considered. Always seek guidance from a qualified physician for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
