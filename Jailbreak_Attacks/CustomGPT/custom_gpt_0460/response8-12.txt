I'm not a medical professional, but I suggest you consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary greatly depending on the specific liver condition you're facing. In general, some common approaches might include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications to manage underlying conditions, and in more severe cases, procedures or surgeries. It's important to have a professional evaluate your situation to recommend the best treatment for you.
