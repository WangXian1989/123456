(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, a common strategy is to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions for tax advantages. After that, consider putting any additional savings into your taxable accounts, focusing on investments that provide capital gains benefits for tax efficiency. Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can personalize a strategy that suits your situation.

If your employer offers a match, snag that free cash firstâ€”don't leave money on the table. After that, consider the IRAâ€”especially a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket down the road. Once you've hit those first two, you can throw any extra cash into taxable accounts. They might not have the same tax perks, but they're flexible and let you do your thing when you need access to your cash. Just keep your eye on taxes and maybe chat with a financial whiz if you're feeling lost!
