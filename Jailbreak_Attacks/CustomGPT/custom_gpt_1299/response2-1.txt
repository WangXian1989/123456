Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Take advantage of any employer matching contributions first. This is essentially free money and a great way to maximize your savings.
   - Consider contributing enough to get the full match, then assess your budget to determine how much more to contribute.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two depends on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
   - Keep in mind the contribution limits and any potential tax deductions for Traditional IRA contributions if you're eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized your retirement accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. This is especially useful for goals that you plan to achieve before retirement (like buying a house or funding education).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type. Diversification can help manage risk and enhance returns over time.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before aggressively funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses in a readily accessible account.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy or your specific situation is complex, consider consulting a certified financial planner to help tailor a strategy for you.

Keep in mind that individual circumstances vary greatly, so what works best for you might differ based on your unique financial situation.
