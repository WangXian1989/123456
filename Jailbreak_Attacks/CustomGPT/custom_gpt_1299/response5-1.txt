(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs because they offer significant tax benefits. Here's a suggested approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to get that full matchâ€”itâ€™s essentially free money. After that, you can evaluate whether to continue contributing depending on fees and investment options.

2. **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA next, as it offers tax benefits for a long-term investment, whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, you can contribute to a taxable account. These funds can provide flexibility for other financial goals outside retirement.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.
