It's generally a good idea to consider a few key factors when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, you might want to focus on your IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Diversification of Tax Treatment**: A mix of pre-tax (401(k) and traditional IRA) and after-tax (Roth IRA) accounts can give you flexibility in managing your taxes in retirement. Consider how your tax situation may change over time.

5. **Consider Your Investment Goals**: Your investment strategy will differ based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. It may be wise to allocate your investments according to whether they are in a tax-advantaged account or a taxable account.

6. **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Savings**: If you have short-term goals or anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, consider using taxable accounts for those funds, as penalties may apply to early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

7. **Revisit and Adjust**: Your financial situation can change, so it's important to revisit your strategy regularly and make adjustments as needed based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your individual circumstances.
