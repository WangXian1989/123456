I'm not a doctor, but some of the best treatment options for liver problems can vary depending on the specific condition. Generally, treatment can include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and regular exercise, medication to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation. It's crucial to work closely with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate course of action for your specific situation.
