To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide significant tax benefits. For a 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to at least get any employer match, and then consider contributing to an IRA.
   - Use a Roth IRA if you are eligible, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments expected to grow significantly over time (such as stocks), as the tax benefits on growth are maximized when taxes are deferred or eliminated.
   - Place more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax exposure.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify the investments within each account based on risk tolerance and timeline. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative assets to spread risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy thoughtfully. During retirement, start by withdrawing from taxable accounts to minimize taxes and avoid penalties on your 401(k) and IRA until mandatory distribution ages.

By strategically allocating funds and choosing appropriate investment types for each account, you can optimize your overall investment growth and minimize tax liabilities over time.
