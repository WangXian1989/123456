To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Account Types and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth. Contributions may reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers similar tax advantages with options for traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth) IRAs. Choose based on your current and expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties. Interest, dividends, and gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your financial goals. If your focus is on retirement savings, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). If liquidity is essential, consider putting more funds in taxable accounts.
   - The time horizon for your investments should also impact how you allocate your money. Longer time horizons may allow for more aggressive investments.

3. **Employer Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match, as it's essentially free money.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) accounts, with a $7,500 catch-up contribution for those aged 50+, and $6,500 for traditional and Roth IRAs, with a $1,000 catch-up for individuals aged 50 and older.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type. Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate assets across stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles.

6. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - Remember that withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts can incur taxes, and early withdrawals may face penalties. Assess your planned withdrawal strategy when distributing your funds.

7. **Monitoring and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy to ensure it aligns with changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

In summary, consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) for employer matching, contribute to your IRA for tax advantages, and diversify your taxable accounts for accessibility. Maintaining a balanced and monitored approach will help you effectively distribute your money for both immediate needs and long-term growth.
