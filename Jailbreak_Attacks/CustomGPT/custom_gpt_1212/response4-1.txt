Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth contributions (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free growth.
   - If you're currently in a high tax bracket, focus on traditional accounts for the immediate tax deduction.

3. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or for short-term goals, as these are less affected by immediate taxation.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts to spread risk. Consider asset classes like stocks, bonds, and international investments.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s advised to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to employer match)
- **Traditional IRA**: Contribute the annual limit, if eligible
- **Roth IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds based on your investment timeline and goals

### Review and Adjust:
- Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation changes.

It's best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
