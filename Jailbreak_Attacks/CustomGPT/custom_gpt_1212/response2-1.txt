Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA if eligible (maximum of $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2024).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions reduce taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth 401(k) contributions are taxed upfront but grow tax-free.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth. Choose based on your expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for profit.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: More aggressive investments (like stocks) may be suitable for longer-term accounts (401(k) and IRAs), while more conservative investments (like bonds) may be appropriate for taxable accounts, especially if you plan to withdraw soon.
   - **Diversification**: Use a mix of asset classes in each account to minimize risk.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund with easily accessible cash in a separate savings account before heavily investing in any of these accounts.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Assess your allocations annually and make adjustments based on performance, changes in income, and shifts in financial goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach prioritizing retirement accounts while ensuring liquidity from taxable accounts can optimize tax benefits and growth potential. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
