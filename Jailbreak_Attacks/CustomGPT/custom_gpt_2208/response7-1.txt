The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Assess Tax Implications**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as income. In contrast, Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) involve post-tax contributions, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: Depending on your tax situation, it might be beneficial to split your contributions between tax-deferred accounts (like traditional 401(k)s and IRAs) and tax-advantaged accounts (like Roth IRAs). This allows for greater flexibility in retirement.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Having funds in taxable accounts can offer more flexibility for withdrawals without tax penalties, while tax-advantaged accounts can help manage your tax burden.

5. **Account for Investment Horizons**: Allocate funds based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. Younger investors may choose to prioritize growth-focused investments in retirement accounts, while those nearing retirement might focus more on capital preservation.

6. **Taxable Accounts for After-Tax Income**: If you've maximized your retirement accounts and have additional funds to invest, taxable brokerage accounts can be useful for flexibility and liquidity.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your investment allocations in all accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
