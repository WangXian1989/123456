The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve hit your contribution limits on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how investments will be taxed. Long-term capital gains from taxable accounts are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure that you’re maintaining a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, adjusting for the different tax treatments of each account type.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, your asset allocation may drift. Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts.

It’s always wise to consult with a financial advisor to personalize these recommendations based on your situation.
