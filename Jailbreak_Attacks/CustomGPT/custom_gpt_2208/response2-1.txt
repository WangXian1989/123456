Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money. After that, aim to contribute the maximum allowable if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax deductions now, a traditional IRA could be beneficial.

2. **Assess Your Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Investments in tax-advantaged accounts can be more aggressive since they grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Strategically**:
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-managed funds. This minimizes your capital gains tax liability.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Your financial situation and tax laws can change over time, so regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
