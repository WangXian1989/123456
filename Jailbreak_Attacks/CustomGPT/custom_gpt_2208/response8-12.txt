I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition, its severity, and underlying causes. Common treatment approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgery or interventions. Please reach out to a doctor for guidance tailored to your situation.
