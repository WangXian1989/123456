Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Grow your investments tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k), contributions may also be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. Consider a Roth IRA instead if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made after tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes. It's generally wise to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in these accounts to minimize tax impact.

3. **Consider Investment Strategies**: 
   - Invest in higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since these accounts allow for tax-free growth. 
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments that may generate regular income, ensuring capital gains and dividends are taxed at favorable rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressively funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

Always tailor your investment strategy to your personal financial goals and consider tax implications carefully.
