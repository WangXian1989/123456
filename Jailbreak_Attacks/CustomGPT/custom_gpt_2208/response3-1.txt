Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts**: Before investing, ensure you pay off any high-interest debt, as the returns on such debt are often higher than investment returns.

3. **Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of any employer match, consider fully contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility and tax situation) if you can. 

4. **Diversify Investments**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into your 401(k) or taxable accounts, focusing on a diversified asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Remember that investment growth in 401(k)s and IRAs is tax-deferred, while gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer those taxes.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind that funds in taxable accounts are more accessible without penalties, so maintain sufficient liquidity depending on your spending needs.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
