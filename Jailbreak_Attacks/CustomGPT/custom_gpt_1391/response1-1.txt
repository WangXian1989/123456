To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money. After maximizing the match, consider how much to contribute based on your income and retirement goals.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs might provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate your current tax situation and projected future taxes to decide which is best for you.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™re maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. These are useful for investments you might want to access before retirement or for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when buying and selling investments in these accounts.

4. **Overall Strategy**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts aligned with your risk tolerance and investing time horizon. Consider tax implications, like placing bonds in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) to avoid high taxes on interest income.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions to ensure alignment with your financial goals, adjusting for changes in income or life circumstances.

As always, considering consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
