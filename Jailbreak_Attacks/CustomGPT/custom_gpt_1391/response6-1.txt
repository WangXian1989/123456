Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a simplified approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth and may include employer matching. Best for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-deferred (or tax-free with a Roth IRA). Useful for long-term savings with specific contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains tax on profits. Good for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions to get any employer match. 
   - Fund your IRA next, especially if it’s a Roth, as it provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings beyond retirement accounts or for short-term goals.

3. **Balance Based on Goals**:
   - If retirement is a primary goal: Focus on maxing out 401(k) and IRA, then allocate excess to taxable accounts.
   - For shorter-term needs: Prioritize taxable accounts while still contributing to retirement accounts.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - Consider your current and future tax brackets. Tax-deferred accounts can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed later. 
   - Taxable accounts may offer more flexible withdrawal options without penalties, though taxes on gains will apply.

A balanced distribution may look something like this:
- **70% in 401(k) (max contribution for the match)**
- **20% in IRA (Roth or Traditional based on income limits)**
- **10% in Taxable Accounts (for liquidity and flexibility)**

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation!
