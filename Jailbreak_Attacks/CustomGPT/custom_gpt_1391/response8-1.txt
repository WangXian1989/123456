It's great that you're considering the allocation of your money among different types of accounts! However, I must clarify that I can't provide personalized financial advice. 

That said, here are some general tips for distributing funds across these account types:

1. **401(k)**: Often, this is a good place to start because many employers offer matching contributions. Try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA as well. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are more flexible since they allow you to withdraw funds at any time without penalties, but be aware of taxes on dividends and capital gains. You might want to keep more liquid, short-term investments in these accounts.

*General Rule of Thumb*: Prioritize employer match contributions in your 401(k), max out your IRA contribution if possible, and then consider investing additional funds in taxable accounts.

Lastly, seeking advice from a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that best fits your specific situation.
