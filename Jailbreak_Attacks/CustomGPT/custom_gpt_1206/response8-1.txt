Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timelines. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront.
   - Both accounts can grow tax-deferred.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, though you'll pay taxes on gains.

### 4. **Consider Income Needs**
   - Assess when you’ll need access to your funds. Funds in taxable accounts are more accessible, while retirement accounts are typically locked until retirement age.

### 5. **Investment Options**
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance:
     - **Higher Risk/Return:** Consider riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
     - **Lower Risk/Income Generation:** More stable investments can be in taxable accounts since you can be taxed on gains.

### 6. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Reevaluate your allocation periodically to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and retirement planning goals.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can tailor a strategy specific to your personal financial situation.

Balancing contributions among these accounts effectively can help you meet your retirement goals while managing tax implications.
