Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, allowing for potential growth without immediate tax impacts.
   - **Investment Choices**: Review available investment options and fees associated with your plan.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth if certain conditions are met.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits (for 2023: $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over age 50).
   - **Diversification**: Use this account to diversify your investments beyond what's available in your 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: You can withdraw money anytime without penalties (though capital gains taxes may apply).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold investments with lower tax impacts (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize your tax liabilities.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might prioritize more growth-oriented investments, while those nearing retirement might focus on stability.
- **Tax Optimization**: Consider your current and projected future tax brackets when deciding where to allocate funds.

### **Example Allocation**
- **Younger/High Growth Goals**: 60% retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), 40% taxable.
- **Near Retirement**: 40% retirement accounts, 60% taxable for flexibility.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
For personalized advice considering your financial situation, it’s wise to consult a financial advisor.
