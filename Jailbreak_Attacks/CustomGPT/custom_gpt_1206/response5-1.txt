(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

It's beneficial to diversify investments across all accounts, balancing risk and growth based on your age and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Distributing your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can feel like juggling flaming swords, but hereâ€™s a game plan:

1. **401(k)**: First off, snag any employer matchâ€”youâ€™d be a fool to leave free money on the table! Go for the max contribution if you can swing it. 
   
2. **IRA**: Next up, go for an IRA. Whether itâ€™s Roth or traditional depends on if you wanna pay taxes now or later. The Roth is great if you expect your income to rise; otherwise, just dive into the traditional.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've stuffed those tax-advantaged accounts to the brim, let some cash flow into taxable accounts. They donâ€™t have all the tax benefits, but the flexibility can be a lifesaver when you need funds.

Just remember: diversity is key! Spread that investment love around to dodge risk. And hey, a chat with a financial wizard never hurts!
