To optimize your money distribution between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred contributions; potential employer match; higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth); flexible investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; gains taxed annually, but more flexibility in withdrawals.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match** in your 401(k) first as it's essentially "free money."
   - **Consider maxing out your IRA** contributions next, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to minimize taxes during accumulation.
   - Allocate more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Determine Your Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Your age, investment horizon, and risk tolerance should guide how aggressively you invest in each account.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**: 
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to align with changing goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider getting personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
