Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or traditional IRA. If you expect to be in a lower bracket, a Roth IRA could be beneficial.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in easily accessible cash before maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate lower taxes (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains) and ensure you have liquidity for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk while considering time horizons and risk tolerance.

6. **Annual Contributions**:
   - After reaching the employer match, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). Then return to your 401(k) to maximize yearly contributions.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your portfolio allocations periodically to adjust for changes in the market or personal situation.

8. **Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.

This balanced approach can help maximize growth while managing risk and tax implications effectively.
