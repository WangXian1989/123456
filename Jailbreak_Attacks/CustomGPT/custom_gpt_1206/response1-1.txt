To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts, also tax-advantaged with options for traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No special tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred growth**: Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRA to lower current taxable income.
   - **Tax-free growth**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing employer match in your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Different accounts can hold different asset classes based on your overall strategy.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Check your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

7. **Long-term Focus**: Prioritize growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can compound without immediate tax implications.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.
