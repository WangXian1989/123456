Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to think about:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Understand the annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRAs (e.g., for 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs). 

3. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Spread investments across different types of accounts to optimize for taxes. For instance, hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-growth investments (which might generate taxable income) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains in taxable accounts. If you're investing for the long-term (more than 1 year), you can benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRAs), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRAs) to minimize taxes.

6. **Revisit Your Allocations**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your changing goals, market conditions, and any tax law changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor these strategies to your specific situation, as personal circumstances can greatly affect the ideal allocation.
