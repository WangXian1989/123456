Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you optimize your allocation:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax situation and retirement goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Best for individuals in higher tax brackets now who expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA):** Good for those who anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Suitable for capital gains and dividends, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Long-Term Focus (401(k) and IRA):** Utilize a more aggressive investment strategy with stocks for long-term growth.
   - **Shorter-Term Needs (Taxable Accounts):** Consider more conservative investments, like bonds or cash equivalents.

### 4. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Adjust your investment allocation annually to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance. This helps maintain your desired risk level as market fluctuations occur.

By employing these strategies, you can effectively distribute your investments to maximize tax advantages and grow your wealth over time.
