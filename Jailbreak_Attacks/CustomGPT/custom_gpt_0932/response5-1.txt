Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax strategy. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Further Contributions**: After maximizing the match and funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, then consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to funds.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Continuous Review**: Regularly review your allocation based on changes in your income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation might also be beneficial.
