I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information on liver problems and potential treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.

### Common Treatment Options for Liver Issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can support liver health. Avoiding processed foods, trans fats, and excessive sugar is often recommended.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol can significantly improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications might be prescribed to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or address underlying causes.

3. **Weight Management**:
   - For those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), weight loss can lead to improvements in liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests may be necessary to monitor the progression of liver disease.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, such as cirrhosis or liver tumors, surgery or procedures like a liver transplant may be discussed.

### Alternative Therapies:
- Some people explore herbal supplements or alternative medicine, but it's essential to discuss these with a doctor, as they can sometimes interact with medications or exacerbate liver problems.

### When to See a Doctor:
- If you have symptoms like jaundice, abdominal pain, or unexplained weight loss, consult a healthcare provider promptly.

Again, please discuss these options with a medical professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
