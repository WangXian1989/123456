Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you have the means.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes on the investment gains. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and real estate investment trusts) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Your age and risk tolerance should influence your asset allocation. Younger investors often take more risk with a higher stock allocation, while older investors may shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your life circumstances, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation.
