Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for possible tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a cash reserve in your taxable account for emergencies.

### 5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**
   - Align your investments with your time frame: use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to your changing financial situation and goals.

### Example Strategy
- **Max 401(k) Contributions:** Up to employer match and consider maxing out if you can afford it.
- **Contribute to IRA:** As much as possible, targeting either traditional or Roth based on your income.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** For additional savings or when tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.

Consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances is always a wise choice.
