The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. 
   - **401(k)**: After securing the match, increase contributions here, especially if you prefer the immediate tax deduction.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation to align with changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
- **Prioritize**: Start with employer match, then focus on maxing tax-advantaged accounts, and use taxable accounts for excess savings.
- **Diversify**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks and optimize returns.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
