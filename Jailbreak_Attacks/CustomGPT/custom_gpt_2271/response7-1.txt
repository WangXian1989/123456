Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings in a high-yield savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, as the tax rates may be lower than ordinary income tax rates if held long-term.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on growth.
   - Consider bonds or fixed-income investments in taxable accounts, as they might generate income that is taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly monitor and adjust your allocations based on life changes and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your specific situation.
