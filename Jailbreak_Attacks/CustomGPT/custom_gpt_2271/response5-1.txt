To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax benefits, either tax-deferred growth (401(k) and traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your eligibility, you can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate frequent capital gains or interest income, as these are taxed annually. These accounts can also be more flexible for withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach will help you maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
