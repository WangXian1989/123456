Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money!
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if possible, as it lowers your taxable income.

2. **IRA** (Traditional/Roth):
   - **Tax Strategy**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're within annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use these for money you'll need before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Investment Types**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Allocation Tips:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance in each account.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you’re diversified across all accounts to spread risk.
- **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments and withdrawals.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your allocation periodically based on performance and changing financial goals. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
