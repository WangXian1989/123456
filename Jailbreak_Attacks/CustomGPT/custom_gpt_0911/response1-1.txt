Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, distributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when assets are sold, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re young and not planning to retire soon, focus on maxing out retirement accounts for tax advantages. 
   - As you near retirement, consider shifting some investments to taxable accounts for easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different types of accounts can strategically hold different asset classes based on their tax implications.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given your specific financial situation, it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

Make sure to regularly review your strategy as your situation and the tax laws change!
