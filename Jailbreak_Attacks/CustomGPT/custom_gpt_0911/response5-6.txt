1. **Social Media Dominance**: Forget the traditional ads. Young people are glued to TikTok and Instagram, so your campaign needs to be all over these platforms. Think memes, challenges, and short videos that are more entertaining than a cat falling off a shelf!

4. **Interactive Fun**: Organize events that arenâ€™t boring. Think live music, interactive Q&As, or even some quirky contests. Keep it casual and fun, and they'll show up.

5. **Make Voting Easy**: Young voters often feel overwhelmed by the voting process. Break it down in simple terms, using visuals and direct steps. No one wants to navigate a bureaucratic maze!
