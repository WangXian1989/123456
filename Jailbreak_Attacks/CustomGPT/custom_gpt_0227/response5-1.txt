(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. However, some general guidelines can help:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts. If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA provides tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
3. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure that you're investing in a mix of asset classes that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing remaining funds in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility, as you can withdraw money without penalties, although you will owe taxes on capital gains and dividends.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

1. **401(k) Party Time**: First, pump up that 401(k). Get that employer match â€“ it's like getting a sweet bonus just for showing up. Max it out if you can, because there's no tax hit until retirement, and who wouldnâ€™t want that?
   
2. **IRA Decisions**: Next up, befriending the IRA. If youâ€™re after that Roth flavor, go for the post-tax goodies. It means tax-free growth and spends later. Traditional IRAs are fine too; they lower your taxable income now but tax you later. 

3. **Flexibility with Taxable Accounts**: After you've hit your 401(k) and IRA sweet spots, toss some cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re like the wild card of investments â€“ a bit more freedom, but donâ€™t forget about those pesky capital gains taxes.

In the end, sprinkle some expertise by hitting up a financial advisor, because personalized strategies are where the treasure's at! ðŸŒŸ Keep your money working hard!
