I'm not a healthcare professional, but it's important to consult with a qualified doctor to discuss any liver problems you may have. They can provide personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatment approaches for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medication, and possibly medical procedures, depending on the underlying cause. Please seek professional medical advice for your situation.
