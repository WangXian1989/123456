Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. It's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income, while Roth 401(k) provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Tax Benefits**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals, depending on qualifying factors.
   - **Investment Options**: IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawing funds without penalties, and you can access them at any time. They're ideal for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends. Consider utilizing tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Maintain an appropriate balance of diversification while taking advantage of the tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations, rebalance as needed, and adjust for changes in financial goals, risk tolerance, or market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and objectives.
