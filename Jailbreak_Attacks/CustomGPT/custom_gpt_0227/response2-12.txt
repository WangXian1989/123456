I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's important to consult a healthcare professional regarding liver problems. They can provide you with the most accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options based on your specific condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. Please seek medical advice for personalized guidance.
