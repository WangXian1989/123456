Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before looking elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a high-yield savings account. This should be prioritized before investing excess income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider adding to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your goals. For long-term growth, stocks may be best, while bonds could be appropriate for short-term goals and risk mitigation.

5. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance. Younger investors may prioritize growth, while those nearing retirement might prefer stability.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial planner. They can provide tailored strategies based on your unique financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments across different accounts.
