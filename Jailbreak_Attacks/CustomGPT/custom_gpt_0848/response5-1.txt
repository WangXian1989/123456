When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. These contributions reduce your taxable income, and the investments grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible for a Roth IRA, consider this for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. A traditional IRA provides immediate tax benefits, allowing you to reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals that are short-term or don’t fit into retirement accounts. It’s also a good place for investments that generate lower capital gains tax, like index funds or tax-efficient funds.

### Recommended Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k) contributions**, especially to the match limit.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (Roth if eligible) after maxing out the 401(k).
- **Invest any additional savings in taxable accounts**, focusing on long-term investments for favorable capital gains treatment.

### Important Considerations:
- Be aware of contribution limits for each account.
- Consider your current and expected future tax rates.
- Align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
