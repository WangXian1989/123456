The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to help you strategize your distribution:

### 1. Understanding Account Types
- **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer match. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
- **IRA**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Choose based on your expected future tax rate.
- **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible access to funds without penalties but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before other accounts.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out IRAs and 401(k)s before contributing significantly to taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider your future tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

### 3. Ongoing Contributions
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your contributions based on market performance and changing financial needs.
- **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified investment strategy to manage risk.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50% (especially if you have an employer match)
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%

### Final Tips
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice based on your individual situation.
- **Monitor Changes in Tax Laws**: Understand how tax policy changes may impact your strategy. 

This approach will help you optimize your savings and investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
