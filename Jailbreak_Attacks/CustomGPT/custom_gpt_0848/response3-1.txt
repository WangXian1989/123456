Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Prioritize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven’t maxed out your contribution, consider increasing it. The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 (if under 50) or $30,000 (if 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, also contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments when sold.

4. **Considerations**:
   - **Investment Timing**: If you need access to funds in the near term, taxable accounts might be more suitable due to their liquidity.
   - **Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) or IRA may incur taxes; however, Roth IRA withdrawals may be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

6. **Regular Review**: Regularly assess your investment strategy and adjust contributions as your financial situation or goals change.
