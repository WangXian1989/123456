Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeframe, and risk tolerance. Here is a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals. If you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial due to the tax deduction on contributions.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate funds in a diversified manner among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean towards a higher stock allocation, while those closer to retirement might tilt towards bonds to reduce risk.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals:**
   - If you have short-term financial goals (like buying a house), place those funds in a taxable account where you can access them without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax-Efficiency:**
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs.

6. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy as you approach retirement. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) will be taxed as ordinary income, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation. They can provide insights based on your income, expenses, and future goals.
