Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Investment Choices**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) and choose a diversified mix based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2023 (or $7,500 if 50 or older). 
   - **Tax Considerations**: A traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situations.
   - **Diversification**: Similar to your 401(k), select a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your long-term goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts can be used for short-term goals or to access funds without penalties.
   - **Investment Choices**: You have more investment flexibility in taxable accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, as they may have lower capital gains distributions.
   - **Tax Impact**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains; strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help optimize tax efficiency.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then max out an IRA.
- **Assess Your Needs**: Depending on your time horizon, risk tolerance, and tax considerations, the remaining funds can be allocated to a taxable account.
- **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Over time, make adjustments as your financial situation or goals change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs.
