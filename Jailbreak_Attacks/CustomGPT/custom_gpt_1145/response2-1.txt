Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Post-Tax**: Money in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA is usually tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. This can be beneficial for short-term needs or as a way to diversify sources of income in retirement.

3. **Blend for Flexibility**:
   - Keep a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to provide flexibility in retirement when it comes to withdrawals and managing your tax bracket.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a long time until retirement, you might lean more heavily on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRAs. For shorter timeframes, more conservative investments in taxable accounts might make sense.

5. **Review Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Each account can have a different risk profile based on its intended use.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and the impact of personal circumstances, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By carefully allocating your money across these accounts, you can optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications.
