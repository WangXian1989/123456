I'm sorry to hear that you're having liver problems. It's really important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice and treatment based on your specific condition. General treatment options for liver issues can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medication, and in severe cases, surgery or transplantation. Please make sure to reach out to a doctor for proper guidance.
