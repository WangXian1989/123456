(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Generally, a common strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first before considering taxable accounts. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you're contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to your IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility).
   
3. **Taxable accounts**: Any additional savings can be placed in taxable accounts, where you have more flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your individual circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: Hammer away at that 401(k) until you're maxing out contributions, especially if your employer is throwing in free money with a matchâ€”donâ€™t leave that cash on the table! 

2. **IRA Next**: Once youâ€™ve milked the 401(k), jump into your IRA. If you can, do a Roth for those sweet tax-free withdrawals laterâ€”who doesnâ€™t want that?

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, any left-over cash goes into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility when you want to be able to dip into it without penalties. 

The idea is to take advantage of the tax benefits when you can, and the rest you can invest freely. Just make sure to keep an eye on tax implications, but hey, thatâ€™s what accountants are for, right? Get your financial game tight!
