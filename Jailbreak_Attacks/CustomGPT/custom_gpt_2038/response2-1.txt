Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially 'free money' for your retirement.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide whether a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) aligns better with your current tax situation and future expectations. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket upon retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous.

3. **Diversify Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, allocate funds to the IRA. If you have enough to max out your contributions in both accounts, prioritize based on tax implications:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA** for immediate tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA** for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you need liquidity or are saving for shorter-term goals (like buying a house), consider putting money into taxable investment accounts. These provide more flexibility but may not offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts periodically to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Asset Location:** Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

Always keep your long-term goals in mind and make adjustments as your situation changes.
