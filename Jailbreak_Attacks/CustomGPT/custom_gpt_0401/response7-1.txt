Determining how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to start.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Funding Traditional IRA**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your 401(k) match and Roth IRA, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA. This can provide potential immediate tax benefits since contributions may be tax-deductible.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are good for flexibility and when you want to access funds without penalties. However, you will owe capital gains taxes on earnings. Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term savings.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund Priority**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before aggressively investing in these accounts.

It's critical to review your financial situation regularly and adjust your strategy as needed. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
