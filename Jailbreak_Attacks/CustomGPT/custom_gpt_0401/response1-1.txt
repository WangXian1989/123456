When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, which can help your investments grow more effectively over time.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investment allocations across these accounts are diversified. This might involve spreading your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** Be strategic about what goes into taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts based on your current and expected future tax brackets. For instance, placing higher-yielding investments in tax-advantaged accounts can minimize tax liability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level, taking into account performance across all accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawals carefully, especially as you approach retirement. This includes considering which accounts to draw from first based on tax implications, your income needs, and required minimum distributions (RMDs).

Itâ€™s beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your specific financial goals and circumstances.
