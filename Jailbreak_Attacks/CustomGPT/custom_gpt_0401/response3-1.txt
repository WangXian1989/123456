To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for investments that generate higher taxes, such as bonds or REITs. Keep stocks or investments with long-term growth potential in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to at least obtain any company match. After that, consider funding an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) before adding more to the 401(k), particularly if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This may mean holding more aggressive investments in your retirement accounts, where gains can grow tax-deferred, while keeping more stable or income-producing investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts. Typically, you should withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later on.

5. **Consult a Financial Professional**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide insights based on your unique financial situation, investment goals, and tax implications.

By combining these strategies, you can create a well-balanced approach to managing and distributing your investments across different account types.
