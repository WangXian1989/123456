The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, like tax-deferred growth (401(k)) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." After maximizing the match, assess if prioritizing your 401(k) or IRA is best based on the fees, investment options, and your tax situation.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is typically advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, while a traditional IRA may benefit those currently in a higher tax bracket who want tax deductions now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts. Different account types might benefit from different asset classes (e.g., more stocks in taxable accounts for better tax management).

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement, as this can influence how you should allocate assets now (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing).

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation. Overall, the key is to maintain a balance that aligns with your long-term financial goals while taking advantage of tax benefits.
