When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a general guide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. The contribution limit is usually higher than an IRA.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After the 401(k) match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions. A Roth IRA could be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are useful for short-term goals or as a buffer for emergency funds since they allow more flexibility for withdrawals. Investments here are taxed when sold and may also incur capital gains taxes, so they can be less tax-efficient than retirement accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments Based on Goals:**
   - Allocate investments within these accounts based on both your risk tolerance and your time horizon. For example, you might hold more aggressive stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts (where gains are not taxed until withdrawal) and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** 
   - As your financial situation and market conditions change, remember to review and rebalance your investments across these accounts at least annually to ensure alignment with your long-term goals.
