To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If your income is high, prioritizing Traditional accounts may help to reduce your taxable income.
   - Roth accounts can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts, but be mindful of potential tax implications when selling investments in taxable accounts.
   - For taxable accounts, consider using tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs which typically generate lower short-term capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term investments (like retirement), higher-risk assets may be appropriate in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments might be suitable in taxable accounts for liquidity.

5. **Review and Adjust Periodically**: 
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on age, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal circumstance.
