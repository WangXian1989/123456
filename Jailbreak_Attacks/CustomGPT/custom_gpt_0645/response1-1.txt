The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA Accounts:** After maxing out your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** Once your IRA contributions are maxed out (if applicable), continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Both account types offer tax advantages.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use a taxable account for any additional savings or investments once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of taxes on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation:** Regardless of where you invest, ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Consider diversification to spread out risk.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, or life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
