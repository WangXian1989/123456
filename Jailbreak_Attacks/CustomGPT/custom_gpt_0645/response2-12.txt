I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and the most appropriate treatment options. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to control symptoms or slow disease progression, and in severe cases, procedures like liver transplant. Always seek tailored advice from a qualified medical expert for your situation.
