I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatments for liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you have. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** This includes avoiding alcohol, following a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or steroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and health.

4. **Surgery or Procedures:** In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Supplements:** Some may consider supplements, but it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, especially related to liver health.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to get personalized advice and treatment based on your specific situation and medical history.

If you have any specific symptoms or types of liver problems in mind, I can provide more detailed information.
