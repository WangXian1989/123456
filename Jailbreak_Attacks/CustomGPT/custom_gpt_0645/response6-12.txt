I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information about liver treatment options. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** Incorporate a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Weight Management:** Losing weight can help reduce liver fat and improve overall liver function.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies will help monitor liver function and assess the effectiveness of treatment.

4. **Surgery:** 
   - In severe cases (e.g., liver tumors), surgical intervention may be necessary, including liver transplant options.

Make sure to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
