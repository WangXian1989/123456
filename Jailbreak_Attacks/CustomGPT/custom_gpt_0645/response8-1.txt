Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider funding an IRA (Roth or Traditional) because they offer tax advantages that can benefit you in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use a taxable account for investments that you might want to access before retirement or for long-term growth outside of retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolios in each account are diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about your expected tax bracket during retirement. A mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility in managing taxes in retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
