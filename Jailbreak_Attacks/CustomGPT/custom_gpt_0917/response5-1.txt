When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be analyzed:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income today. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Also offers tax advantages similar to a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and rules.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax upon sale and potentially taxed on dividends. This can be useful for short-term goals or tax-efficient strategies.

2. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**: 
   - Higher-risk investments might be better suited for retirement accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) since you won’t need to access that money for many years.
   - For taxable accounts, consider liquid and lower-risk investments that you might need access to sooner.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Keep in mind the contribution limits for 401(k)s, IRAs, and the more flexible contributions possible in taxable accounts. Maxing out retirement accounts first can provide better long-term tax advantages.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have adequate savings in easily accessible accounts before committing significant funds to retirement accounts.

A common strategy is to max out your 401(k) match first, then contribute to an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts if possible. The proportion can vary based on your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

### Additional Tips:
- Review and adjust your allocations regularly.
- Diversify investments to mitigate risks.
- Consider the withdrawal rules and penalties for each account type as you plan.

Ultimately, the “best” allocation will depend on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.
