Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full matchâ€”it's free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. This can help reduce risk.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or municipal bonds) that generate lower taxable income. 
   - Consider holding bonds and REITs in tax-advantaged accounts because they tend to generate higher taxable income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy for Retirement**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your investment allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and the time horizon until you need to access these funds.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances, including retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
