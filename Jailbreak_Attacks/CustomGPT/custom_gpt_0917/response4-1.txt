Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals).
  
### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Assess whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement. If you think your taxes will increase, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - For high-income years, it might be strategic to focus more on 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions, deferring taxes until retirement.

### 3. **Diversification and Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These provide flexibility since you can access funds without penalties before retirement age. They can also be useful for short-term savings goals or investments not suitable for retirement accounts.
   - Diversify the types of investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) across all accounts to spread risk.

### 4. **Investment Choices**
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure. Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
  
### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Long-Term Outlook**
   - Think about your long-term financial goals and how each account fits into those goals. 

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Fully fund the 401(k) to the company match (e.g., 6% of salary).
2. Contribute to an IRA (up to the annual maximum).
3. If you still have surplus funds, consider additional contributions to your 401(k) or taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that reflects your personal situation, as they can offer support with tax implications, optimal withdrawal strategies later, and investment choices that align with your long-term goals.
