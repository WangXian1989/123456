Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a strategic way to optimize your savings and investment growth. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored Plans First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially “free money” and offers an immediate return.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now but tax you on withdrawals later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA(s), you can invest additional money in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and don’t have the contribution limits that retirement accounts do.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If you need funds in the short term, lean towards taxable accounts for easier access. For long-term savings, prioritize the tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk. This means holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Review Tax Implications**
   - Keep in mind that earnings in your 401(k) and IRAs grow tax-deferred, while taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider strategies for tax-loss harvesting in your taxable accounts.

### 7. **Adjust as Needed**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
