The optimal distribution of your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k):** Take full advantage of any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA.

### 2. **Focus on Asset Location**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are typically taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place high-growth investments and bonds in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax implications on interest and dividends.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. Suitable for higher-income earners.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Ideal for younger investors expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 4. **Investment Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Allocate a significant portion to equities in tax-advantaged accounts if you don’t need access to these funds soon.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid and less volatile investments in taxable accounts.

### Summary
- **Maximize contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- **Diversify investments** based on expected tax impact and growth potential.
- Regularly **review and adjust** your allocations based on changing financial situations and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor may further tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
