Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contributory Limits**: Consider the contribution limits of each account:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax, but you have flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Investment Options**: Assess the investment choices available within each account. Some 401(k) plans may have limited investment options compared to IRAs and taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering asset location. For example, place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on performance and changes in financial goals or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.
