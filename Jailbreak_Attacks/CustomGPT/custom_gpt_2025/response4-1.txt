To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Utilize this for pre-tax contributions. It's beneficial for high-income years due to immediate tax savings.
   - **IRA**: Choose a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. A traditional IRA can be advantageous for tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align contributions with your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs, and let retirement accounts grow for the long haul.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer matches in your 401(k) first, then consider IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth, if eligible), and lastly, fund taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation across all accounts is consistent, balancing stocks, bonds, and other investments according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your target asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to your specific situation.
