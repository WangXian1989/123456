Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Account:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.
   - **Contribute to Max Limits:** Try to contribute the annual maximum if possible. This reduces your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. If you need tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA could work better.
   - **Diversification:** Allocate funds to a mix of stocks and bonds within your IRA to align with your risk tolerance.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement, as they do not have the same penalties or restrictions as retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on long-term investments to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes, and consider tax-efficient funds.

### Overall Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have three to six months' worth of expenses saved in an easily accessible account before investing heavily.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Regular Review:** Adjust your allocations as needed based on life changes, market conditions, and your retirement timeline.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
