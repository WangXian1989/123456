Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you an upfront tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings. These accounts provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals but come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability. Reserve higher-income-generating assets for your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of individual circumstances, it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Diversifying your investments among these accounts helps optimize tax benefits and manage risk over time.
