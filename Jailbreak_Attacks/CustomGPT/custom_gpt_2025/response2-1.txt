Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; that’s free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Focus on investments that align with your long-term goals. Consider low-cost index funds or target-date funds.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). If you expect your tax rate to be lower, a Traditional IRA can be beneficial.
   - **Coordinated Investments**: Use the IRA for investments that might generate higher taxable income (like bonds) to defer taxes longer.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Withdrawals**: Use this account for shorter-term goals or emergencies, as it typically offers more liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Favor tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which may minimize capital gains distributions.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts.
- **Diversification**: Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) to manage risk.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### Consult a Professional:
Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific situation and goals.
