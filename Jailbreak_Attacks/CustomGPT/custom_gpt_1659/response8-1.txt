The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible in the contribution year, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow with no tax until sold. Qualifying dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments within these accounts. Consider risk tolerance and time horizon when selecting asset allocations.

4. **Emergency Savings**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have adequate emergency savings outside of these accounts.

5. **Long-term Goals**: Allocate more towards retirement accounts for long-term growth (consider maxing out IRAs and contributing significantly to your 401(k)) and use taxable accounts for shorter-term savings or specific goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changing financial situations and market conditions.
