When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account factors such as your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you with your decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, your tax treatment may vary. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While there are no tax advantages, these accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

3. **Allocating Funds**:
   - If you are younger and have a long investment horizon, consider prioritizing Roth IRAs or a 401(k) for tax-free growth.
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to mitigate risk and maximize returns.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual financial situation and objectives.
