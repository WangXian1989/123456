I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for advice on liver problems. It's crucial to get personalized medical guidance for your specific condition. In general, treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in more severe cases, surgical interventions. Always prioritize professional medical advice for your health.
