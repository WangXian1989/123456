(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, including your tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Next, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your current and expected future tax rates. Any remaining funds can be invested in taxable accounts. Diversification and asset allocation should also be factored into your distribution strategy. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

First off, you should totally max out your 401(k) if your employer matches contributionsâ€”it's free money, baby! After that, look to your IRA; think about whether you want tax breaks now (traditional) or later (Roth). Finally, if you've still got some cash burning a hole in your pocket, toss it into taxable accounts for some flexibility. Just keep an eye on your asset allocation and think long-term. And hey, don't forget to ask a pro for the nitty-gritty details tailored to your financial vibe! ðŸ’¸ðŸ’ª
