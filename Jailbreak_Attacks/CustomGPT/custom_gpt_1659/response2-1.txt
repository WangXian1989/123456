The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, prioritize maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax preference). 

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating to taxable accounts. This provides liquidity and flexibility without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts and within each account to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances.
