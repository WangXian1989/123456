To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it ideal if you expect your tax rate to rise.

### 2. **Strategize Taxable Accounts**
   - Once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed, allocate funds to taxable accounts. Ideal investments here include:
     - **Index Funds:** Lower turnover and capital gains taxes.
     - **Tax-Advantaged Investments:** Municipal bonds can provide tax-free income.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize investments in 401(k) and IRA. Focus on equities for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Maintain a cash reserve in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Reassess your allocations periodically (at least annually) to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Summary
- **Initial Focus:** Maximize tax-advantaged contributions (401(k) and IRA).
- **Subsequent Investments:** Diversify into taxable accounts, emphasizing tax efficiency.

This strategy not only helps to minimize taxes but also positions you for a more secure financial future.
