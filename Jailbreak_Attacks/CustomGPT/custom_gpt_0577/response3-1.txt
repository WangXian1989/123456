Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50). The IRA limit is $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Align Investments with Time Horizon:**
   - For retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), invest in a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and the number of years until retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be more flexible; consider holding investments that have favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains or investments that generate qualified dividends.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Taxable accounts can be taxed on realized gains, while funds in Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s grow tax-deferred. Plan for future tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts.

5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund separate from these investment accounts to avoid premature withdrawals.

6. **Review and Adjust Annually:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and performance, adjusting as needed based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and investing wisely based on your financial goals, you can create a strong foundation for your retirement savings.
