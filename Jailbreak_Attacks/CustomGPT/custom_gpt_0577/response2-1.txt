Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic to optimize growth, tax efficiency, and control. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to capture the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), allowing for tax-deferred growth. 
   - **Consider Investment Options:** Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) and choose low-fee options.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA:** Assess your current and future tax situations. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older). Try to maximize this if you can.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Maintain Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer liquidity and can be useful for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which minimize capital gains distributions.
   - **Consider Capital Gains:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling assets in taxable accounts.

### 4. **General Guidelines**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Assess and adjust your portfolio at least annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Seeking Professional Advice**
   - If you're unsure about the best distribution based on your circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your financial goals.

Choosing how to allocate your contributions among these accounts depends on your financial goals, expected retirement timeline, and current tax situation. Be sure to review your strategy periodically as your circumstances change.
