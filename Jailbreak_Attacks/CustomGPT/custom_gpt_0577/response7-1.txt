Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general guide to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contributions:** If your employer’s plan offers good investment options and low fees, consider maximizing your contributions (up to the annual limit).

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax bracket.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Maximize contributions if possible, as IRAs often have lower limits than 401(k)s but provide flexibility in investment choices.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use these accounts for goals with shorter time horizons or when you need more liquidity without penalties.
   - **Investment Choices:** They provide more flexibility in investment options and tax strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **Short-Term Savings (up to 3 years):**
   - Keep in taxable accounts for liquidity.

2. **Medium-Term (3-10 years):**
   - Contribute to IRAs for tax advantages while still maintaining some taxable account allocations for flexibility.

3. **Long-Term (10+ years until retirement):**
   - Max out 401(k) contributions, then utilize IRAs, and finally consider taxable accounts, especially for investments that may result in capital gains.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.
- **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from different accounts as you approach retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
