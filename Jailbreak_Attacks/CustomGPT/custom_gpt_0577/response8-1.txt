Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations to guide your allocation:

### 1. **401(k) Account**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 for individuals under 50 in 2024).
   - **Investment Options**: Review the available investment options in your plan. Some plans offer limited choices.
   - **Withdrawal Rules**: Understand the penalties and tax implications of early withdrawals.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions to a traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if qualified.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The annual limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for IRAs.
   - **Investment Choices**: IRAs often provide more investment options compared to 401(k) plans.
   - **Roth Conversion**: Consider if it makes sense to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments that are sold for a profit. Holding investments for over a year may qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider using this account for investments that are expected to produce dividends or interest income, which can be taxed in the year they are received.

### **General Allocation Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts before allocating excess cash.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Review and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### **Example Allocation Strategy**
- **Retirement Age under 50**:
  - 50% in 401(k) (especially to get full match)
  - 30% in IRA (split between traditional and Roth based on tax strategy)
  - 20% in taxable accounts

- **Retirement Age over 50**:
  - 40% in 401(k)
  - 40% in IRA
  - 20% in taxable accounts
