I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to consult a healthcare professional to get personalized advice for liver problems. They may recommend treatments such as lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or even procedures, depending on the specific liver issue you're facing. Always prioritize seeking advice from a qualified healthcare provider!
