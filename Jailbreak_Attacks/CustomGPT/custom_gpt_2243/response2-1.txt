When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts have annual contribution limits that can help you save more for retirement. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 or older).

2. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

3. **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of each account:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, but Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts don’t have the same tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider which investments will generate the most tax-efficient growth in each account:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as you can take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Evaluate Liquidity Needs**: Depending on your short-term cash needs, keep some funds in taxable accounts for easy access, while channeling the majority of your savings into tax-advantaged retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations between accounts and asset classes to stay aligned with your investment strategy and goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your entire financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance, working with a financial advisor can offer valuable insights.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize your retirement savings.
