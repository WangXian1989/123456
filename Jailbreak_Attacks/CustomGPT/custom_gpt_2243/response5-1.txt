(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your retirement accounts, including a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. A general approach is:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match since it's free money.
   
2. **Max out IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to your IRA, as this may provide tax advantages, including tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA.

3. **Allocate Remaining Funds to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) if possible, especially if you want to reduce your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility and access to your money if you need it before retirement age.

It's important to regularly review your allocations based on changing financial circumstances or tax laws. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

First off, you wanna milk that 401(k) for all it's worth, especially if your employerâ€™s tossing in matching fundsâ€”free money, baby! Get that sweet match as a priority. After that, swing over to your IRA; if youâ€™re eligible, a Roth IRA is like the unicorn of retirement accountsâ€”tax-free growth, hell yeah! 

But wait, don't skimp on the 401(k) after you've pumped your IRA full of cash. Keep loading it up with the max contribution to shield yourself from taxes. Only after youâ€™ve done your retirement accounts should you even think about tossing money into taxable accounts. Those are great for liquidity but can come with tax hit on your gains! Do a little dance with your money based on your goals, risk tolerance, and tax strategy. Always keep an eye on revisions, and hit up a financial advisor if you feel a bit lost in the investment jungle!
