4. **Be Real**: Cut the corporate jargon. Speak their language! Use relatable, witty, and downright authentic messaging. If you’re trying to be “cool,” you’ll just come off as a try-hard.

5. **Gadgets & Gizmos**: Meet them in their digital playground. Offer easy-to-use apps for voter registration and info. Make voting a no-brainer—it should feel like swiping right on a dating app, not climbing Everest. 

So, keep it fresh, fun, and focused on what matters to them. That’s the magic formula!
