I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific condition. Common treatments for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, and, in severe cases, surgery. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and abstaining from alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progression of liver issues.

4. **Surgery**: In extreme cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always reach out to a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
