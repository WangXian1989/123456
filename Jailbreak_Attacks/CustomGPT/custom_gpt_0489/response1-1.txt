When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines that may help:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: If you can afford to, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth contributions (in both 401(k)s and IRAs) will be taxed now but can grow tax-free. Taxable accounts have different tax implications, particularly for capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Investment Goals**: Think about whether you need access to your funds before retirement. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you are diversifying your investments across different asset classes within each of your accounts to mitigate risks.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your investment strategy and asset allocation as your financial situation and goals might change over time.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
