The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) if eligible. IRAs often provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Distribute money into taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax rates, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. High-turnover strategies or investments that generate significant interest income might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**: Maintain an emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account. Funds for short-term goals (within five years) should generally be kept in taxable accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties in retirement accounts.

5. **Retirement Goals**: If your primary goal is retirement, focus on tax-advantaged accounts first. Max out contributions to these before investing heavily in taxable accounts, as they provide significant long-term growth potential.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to optimize growth and manage risk. Different account types can house various investment strategies and asset classes for balance.

Finally, consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized distribution strategy that fits your unique financial situation.
