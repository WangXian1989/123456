When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to evaluate your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. The maximum contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). A Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This may be appropriate for short-term goals or if you desire more liquidity. Keep in mind capital gains tax on earnings in these accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, stocks are better suited for long-term growth (and thus more appropriate for tax-advantaged accounts), while bonds or income-generating assets can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind that withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA in retirement are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals. A strategy involving tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts can also be beneficial.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement timeline.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
