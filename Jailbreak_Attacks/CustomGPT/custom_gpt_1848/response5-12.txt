Iâ€™m not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition affecting your liver. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet (avoiding fatty foods and alcohol), exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medicines may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and catch any issues early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical intervention or potentially a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a tailored plan based on your medical history and current health condition.
