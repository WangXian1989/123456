When planning to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. The 2023 limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: Contribution limits are $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50+). Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible with no contribution limits, but you will pay taxes on any dividends, interest, and realized capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you can. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategies**
   - **Bonds and Income-Producing Assets**: Place these in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income in taxable accounts.
   - **Stocks for Growth**: Can be suitable for taxable accounts as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Maintain some liquidity in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs, as withdrawing from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or life circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to employer match.
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Max out contributions, focusing on tax-free growth with Roth if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds with a focus on long-term growth, prioritizing tax-efficient investments.
