Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This offers tax advantages, either now or during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, invest any additional savings in taxable accounts. This flexibility allows for easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that investment choices within each account are diversified to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting with a financial planner.

This strategy helps balance tax advantages while ensuring adequate access to funds when needed.
