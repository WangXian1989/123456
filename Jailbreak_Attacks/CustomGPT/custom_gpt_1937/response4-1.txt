To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA up to the maximum contribution limits, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Earnings grow tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay capital gains taxes on profits and interest income is taxed as ordinary income.

3. **Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating assets (like bonds) that may be more tax-efficient if held here.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they reflect your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency savings fund outside of these accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation.
