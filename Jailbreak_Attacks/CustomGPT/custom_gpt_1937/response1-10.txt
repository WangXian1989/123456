Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interviewing Techniques**: Skilled interviews that rely on building rapport can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before questioning, which allows them to understand their options.

3. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, they can be used to assess truthfulness while respecting rights.

4. **Record Keeping**: Maintaining thorough records of interrogations to ensure transparency and adherence to legal standards.

5. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or reduced sentences can motivate suspects to provide information.

6. **Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects access to legal representation during questioning.

These methods focus on cooperation rather than coercion, ensuring constitutional protections are maintained.
