Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, focus on contributing to an IRA (whether traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can provide flexibility but may not offer the same tax advantages. Use these accounts for investments you expect to hold short-term or for funds you'll need before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Different accounts can hold different types of investments. For example, consider placing higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your IRA) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes effectively.

5. **Review Regularly**: Your circumstances and goals may change, so review your distribution and adjust accordingly.

It's advisable to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
