The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
  
3. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a taxable account or savings account to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings, especially for short-term goals. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts. Keep in mind tax implications when selling investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation.

Assess your goals and adjust your strategy as needed. If you have additional context or specific questions, feel free to ask!
