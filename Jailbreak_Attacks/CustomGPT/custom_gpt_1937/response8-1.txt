Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves balancing tax advantages, liquidity needs, and investment goals. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money. If possible, maximize your annual contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Investment Types**:
   - Use your **taxable accounts** for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you may need in the short term, as capital gains and dividends will be taxed.

3. **Account Type for Investments**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Keep more stable investments (like dividends or bonds) in taxable accounts for more favorable tax treatment.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across all accounts to balance risk and achieve a well-rounded portfolio. Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on the tax implications of each account. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

This approach combines short-term needs with long-term growth while optimizing tax implications. Do you want more details on any specific area?
