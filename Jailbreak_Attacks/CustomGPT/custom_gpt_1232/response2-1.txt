Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Pre-tax or Roth (after-tax) options.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account offering tax advantages. Options include Traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (after-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max out IRAs:** Contribute the maximum allowed to an IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.
   - **Continue with 401(k):** After IRAs, contribute more to your 401(k) if you have additional funds.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - Hold investments that generate higher taxes (like REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Balance Risk and Return**
   - Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities are favored in growth accounts, while fixed income is often held in income-generating accounts.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations at least annually or as your financial situation changes.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions (up to match)
- **IRA:** 30% of contributions
- **Taxable Account:** 20% for liquidity and investment opportunities

### Conclusion
Customize your strategy based on your specific financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.
