When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize growth and minimize taxes:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA**: Prioritize contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - For tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA), consider a mix of stocks and bonds with a growth focus, as withdrawals during retirement are taxed differently.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Consider Age and Goals**:
   - Younger investors might lean toward aggressive growth with stocks, while those closer to retirement may want to shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes upon selling investments, so consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Conduct a periodic review of your portfolios to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

In summary, maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, diversify your investments based on your life stage, and pay attention to tax implications to optimize your overall portfolio.
