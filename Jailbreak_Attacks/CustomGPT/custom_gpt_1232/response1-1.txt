Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations to optimize your investment strategy. Here are the key factors to keep in mind:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and grow tax-deferred. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or tax-free in retirement (Roth IRA). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains. This can be beneficial for shorter-term goals due to the preferential tax rates on long-term capital gains.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth. Max out employer matches in 401(k) first.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use a taxable account for flexibility without penalties on withdrawals.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure youâ€™re aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to maximize tax benefits.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds based on tax implications and your retirement timeline.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA next.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once maximum contributions are made to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Reassess Regularly:
Review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies.
