Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." If possible, aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth if you're eligible.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may offer tax benefits. If you expect to be in a higher bracket later, consider a Roth IRA.
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for accessing funds without penalties, especially if you need liquidity.

### 3. **Diversify Investment Types**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks or mutual funds. Since these accounts are tax-advantaged, you can afford to take on more risk.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments or tax-efficient funds, as you'll be subject to capital gains and dividend taxes.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on market conditions and life changes.

### 5. **Consider Future Withdrawals**
   - Plan withdrawals based on tax implications; taxable accounts may be better for short-term needs, while retirement accounts should remain untouched as long as possible to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### Summary
Prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider your tax situation, diversify your investments accordingly, and review your strategy regularly. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance for your specific circumstances.
