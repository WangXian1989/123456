Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed as capital gains when sold. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - After maximizing employer matches, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can benefit from tax-deductible contributions.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may yield long-term capital gains or for short-term needs.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts based on performance, risk tolerance, and life changes.

5. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - If you can afford it, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first before contributing significantly to taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, then withdraw from tax-deferred accounts last, minimizing tax impacts.

Always consult with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your situation.
