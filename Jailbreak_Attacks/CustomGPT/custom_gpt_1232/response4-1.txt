Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as possible, especially if your employer matches. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts provide more flexibility with withdrawals, as they aren't subject to the same penalties as retirement accounts.

4. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**: Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, allocate assets differently:
   - **Aggressive Growth**: More stocks in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Income Generation**: Consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to manage taxes on interest and dividends more effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically check your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Adjust contributions accordingly.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about your expected tax rate in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher bracket, Roth accounts may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect a lower rate, Traditional accounts could be advantageous.

7. **Consult a Professional**: It might be helpful to speak with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your unique situation and financial goals.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your investment and tax efficiency as you plan for retirement.
