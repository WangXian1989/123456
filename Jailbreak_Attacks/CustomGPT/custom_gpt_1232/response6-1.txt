When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Max out contributions, especially if you can benefit from tax deductions (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use these for savings beyond your retirement accounts. They offer:
     - **Liquidity:** Access funds without penalties.
     - **Variety of Investments:** Greater choice in asset allocation.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Tax-deferred growth; withdraw when in a potentially lower tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Long-term capital gains tax rates are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates; consider holding investments longer.

### 4. **Investment Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts:
     - **401(k) & IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more conservative investments to manage risk.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**
   - Younger investors may lean towards stocks, while those closer to retirement should focus on bonds and conservative investments to preserve capital.

### Conclusion
Factor in your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals while prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before considering taxable investments. This strategic distribution can maximize your long-term financial growth.
