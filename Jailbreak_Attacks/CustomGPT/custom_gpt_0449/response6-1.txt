To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
   - **Investment Choices**: Use these accounts for growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks), as they are less affected by taxes on dividends or capital gains.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Strategically Allocate Investments**: Invest in lower-growth or dividend-paying assets (like bonds or dividend stocks) here, since you'll pay taxes on gains in the year they're realized.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Consider strategies to offset taxable gains by selling losing investments.

### 3. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio:**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure diversity in asset classes across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain desired risk levels and investment goals.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals:**
   - **Retirement Planning**: Align your allocation strategy with your retirement goals; the younger you are, the more aggressive your investments can be.
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how and when you will withdraw from each account type in retirement to manage tax implications efficiently.

### Key Takeaways:
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
- Use taxable accounts for income-producing investments.
- Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on your financial situation and goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
