Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute to a **Traditional or Roth IRA** next, based on whether you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth) or tax-deductible contributions now (Traditional).
   - If you can, contribute to your 401(k) to the maximum limit after reaching the employer match.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide greater flexibility for withdrawing funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider how you allocate your investments (stocks vs. bonds) in each account type based on their tax implications:
   - **Taxable accounts**: It's often better to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains (like stocks).
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts**: You can hold higher yielding, less tax-efficient investments like bonds or REITs.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly reassess and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and your retirement goals.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies that fit your specific situation. Would you like information on something more specific, like investment options within these accounts?
