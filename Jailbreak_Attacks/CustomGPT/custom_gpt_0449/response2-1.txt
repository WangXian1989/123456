Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough to Get the Match**: Maximize contributions to get any employer match.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider contributing enough to maximize tax advantages.
   - **Investment Choices**: Depending on your plan, assess the investment options available. Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds if you prefer a hands-off approach.

### 2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**
   - **Tax Strategy**: Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice here may depend on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible. The limit for both types of IRAs can change annually, so stay updated.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs for investments that might have more potential for growth, given the tax-free growth potential (especially for Roth IRAs).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. 
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on lower-turnover investments like index funds and ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Diversification**: This is a good place for stocks that might not fit well in tax-advantaged accounts due to their high turnover.

### **General Tips**
- **Asset Allocation**: Keep stocks in tax-advantaged accounts where possible and bonds in taxable accounts, as bonds generate interest income which may be taxed at a higher rate.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk and return profile.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your unique situation and goals.

The goal is to create a balanced and diversified portfolio that aligns with your long-term financial goals while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
