To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Depending on your income, decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're making the maximum allowable contributions if you can afford it.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or emergencies since they have no withdrawal penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### Suggested Distribution:

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses set aside before heavily investing.
- **Aggressive Contributions**: Consider prioritizing 401(k) and IRA contributions over taxable accounts while youâ€™re in your wealth accumulation phase.
- **Balance**: Depending on your goals, you may split contributions (e.g., 50% 401(k), 30% IRA, 20% taxable) but adjust according to your tax strategy and financial goals.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically revisit your allocations based on your financial situation, market conditions, and your retirement timeline.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance that fits your specific situation.
