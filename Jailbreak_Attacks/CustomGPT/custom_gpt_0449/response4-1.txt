Distributing money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Continue to contribute to your 401(k) at least up to the company match. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider if paying taxes now (for tax-free withdrawals later) aligns with your goals.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider maximizing your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional savings to your taxable accounts. This provides flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across these accounts. You might want to hold more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage capital gains.

5. **Review Tax Implications:** Understand how distributions from each account will be taxed. Withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) or IRA are typically taxed as ordinary income, whereas qualified withdrawals from a Roth account are tax-free.

6. **Adjust Over Time:** As your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals change, periodically review and adjust your allocation strategy.
