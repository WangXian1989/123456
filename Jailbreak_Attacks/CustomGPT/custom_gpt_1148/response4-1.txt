The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. However, distributions are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), it offers tax deduction benefits but also taxes withdrawals as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but you can benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates on investments held for over a year.

4. **Allocate Based on Goals**:
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term retirement savings where you're less likely to need funds until retirement.
   - Use IRAs for medium to long-term savings, focusing on tax benefits.
   - Keep taxable accounts for more accessible funds or for investments you may want to sell sooner.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering tax implications. It might be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and goals, adjusting contributions as needed based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

It's advisable to consult with a financial planner or tax advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
