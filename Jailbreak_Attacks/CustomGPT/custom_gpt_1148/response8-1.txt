To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, you could benefit from tax-deductible contributions to a Traditional IRA, or consider a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim to max out IRA contributions if possible.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, more aggressive investments (like stocks) may be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on higher growth.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Taxable accounts can support flexibility. Consider holding investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or bonds. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

5. **Balance Your Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Regularly rebalance your investments to maintain your target allocation.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: In retirement, plan for optimal withdrawals. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

7. **Plan for Taxes**: Understand the tax implications of your investments, particularly in taxable accounts. This includes short-term vs. long-term capital gains taxes.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
