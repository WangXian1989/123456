Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your financial growth and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - **Invest Remaining Funds**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This can be important for short-term goals or emergency funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Stocks can be held in taxable accounts for long-term growth, while bonds may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically reassess your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

By following this structured approach, you can enhance your overall financial strategy while minimizing tax liabilities and optimizing returns.
