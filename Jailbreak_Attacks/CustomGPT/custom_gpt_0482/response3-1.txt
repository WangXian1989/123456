Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After capturing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed if you are in a high tax bracket and want to reduce your taxable income. Also, consider if it offers a Roth option.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your eligibility and tax situation, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be advantageous if you anticipate needing access to your money before retirement.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified. Consider your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and overall portfolio balance (stocks, bonds, etc.).

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Allocate different types of investments based on tax implications. For example, place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

6. **Regular Reassessments**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation, especially considering tax laws and retirement strategies.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, so consider these guidelines a starting point and adjust as needed!
