To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantage**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions up to the annual limit once you've met the match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider your current tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.

2. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments (like stocks) since they can benefit from tax-free growth.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs.

3. **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you have sufficient funds available for short-term needs:
   - Keep a portion of your money in a taxable account for emergency funds or immediate expenses, as these funds can be accessed without penalties.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on interest payments.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for each account type and plan your contributions accordingly. In 2023, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

6. **Consult a Professional**: It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation, ensuring all aspects, including estate planning and withdrawal strategies, are considered.

These strategies can help maximize your savings while effectively managing your tax liabilities.
