Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here’s a general guideline to help you decide how to allocate your investments:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA after taking full advantage of any 401(k) match. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to maximize contributions to both the 401(k) and IRA before moving onto taxable accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and older).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can then invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but they are subject to capital gains taxes on any profits. 

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Within each account type, ensure that you have a well-diversified asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Generally, younger investors may benefit from a higher proportion of equities for growth, while those closer to retirement may want to shift towards bonds and more conservative investments.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of where you hold certain investments. For example, it can be beneficial to hold high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts where you may want to actively manage the tax impact.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Reviewing and rebalancing your distribution periodically is essential as your financial situation and goals evolve over time.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances. They can provide personalized advice that considers your full financial picture.
