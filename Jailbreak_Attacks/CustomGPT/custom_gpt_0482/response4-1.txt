Allocating your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide whether a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is better for you based on your current and expected future tax rates. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2024 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties. Use these accounts for investments that may generate income or capital gains.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

4. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401k/IRA) and tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - **Regular Check-ins**: Review your portfolio regularly and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your unique circumstances.
