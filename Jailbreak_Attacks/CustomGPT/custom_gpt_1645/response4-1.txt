The optimal distribution of money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - Depending on your income and tax filing status, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can contribute to taxable accounts. These are flexible and allow for withdrawals at any time, but they will be subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Consider the types of investments suitable for each account. For example:
     - **401(k)**: Typically, this can hold a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
     - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but you have more options for investments.
     - **Taxable**: Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable income.

5. **Reassess Annually:**
   - Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consider Professional Advice:**
   - If you’re unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so consider these suggestions as guidelines and adjust them according to your personal financial landscape.
