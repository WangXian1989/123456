Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: If you can still contribute more after funding your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions to the maximum limit (currently $22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains and dividends, as you’ll have more flexibility with withdrawals. This is also a good option if you want to maintain liquidity or if you're saving for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments. Tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) are often better placed in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA).

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and returns.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, or tax laws.
