I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent liver function tests can help track the progression of the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver failure, a liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Dietary Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but always consult a healthcare professional before starting any.
