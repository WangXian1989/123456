1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet adjustments (low-fat, high-fiber foods)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests for liver function

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In advanced cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
