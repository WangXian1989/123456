To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k) Contribution**: Focus on contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA Accounts**: Contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Strategic Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth due to tax deferral, while considering safer investments (bonds) in taxable accounts for stability.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals; typically, itâ€™s more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-deferred accounts grow longer.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Your age and how soon you plan to retire should influence your allocation. Younger investors can afford to be more aggressive, whereas those nearing retirement may want a more conservative mix.

### 4. **Review Regularly**
   - Regularly reassess your investments and adjust as needed based on market conditions, changes in your financial goals, and life circumstances.

### Summary
Balancing contributions effectively across these accounts can enhance your overall financial strategy, maximize tax advantages, and prepare for retirement.
