Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here’s a strategy you might consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you can deduct your contributions, it's tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If eligible, this can be a good option for tax diversification.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After securing the match, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) as it has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Fund taxable accounts with money that you may need access to before retirement. These accounts can be more flexible and provide liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) can go in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It’s advisable to tailor your approach based on your individual tax situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance.
