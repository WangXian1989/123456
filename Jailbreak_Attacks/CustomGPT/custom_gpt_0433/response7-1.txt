α The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, financial advisors recommend the following approach:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are tax-deferred.

3. **IRA**: Next, consider funding an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and is a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and international investments.

6. **Periodically Reassess**: Review your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and investment goals.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice to suit your specific situation.
