Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into your IRA or taxable accounts.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
    - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
    - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but taxes are due upon withdrawal.
    - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
    - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains taxes when sold. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) to mitigate taxes.

3. **Segregate Accounts Based on Goals**: 
    - Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.
    - Long-term retirement savings can be placed in 401(k) and IRA accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, consider allocating more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage risk and tax implications.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, having a strategy for withdrawing from accounts based on their tax implications can help minimize taxes over your lifetime.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
