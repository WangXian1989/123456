I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. The treatment options can vary significantly depending on the specific liver issue, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or more advanced therapies like a liver transplant. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Please reach out to a medical expert to discuss your situation further.
