Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions. Depending on your income and tax bracket, one may be more beneficial than the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer greater flexibility for withdrawals and can provide access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: When deciding where to allocate funds, consider the tax implications. Generally, holding investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for the long term can be beneficial, while more flexible investments can be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Balance and Diversify**: Ensure that your investments within these accounts are diversified. Depending on your risk tolerance and age, you might want to adjust your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.).

6. **Stay Within Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your investment potential.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your investment strategy as your financial situation changes (e.g., new job, marital status, etc.).

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

Each individual's situation is unique, so it's essential to analyze your overall financial picture before making decisions.
