To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Understand the contribution limits for each account:
   - **401(k)**: As of 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Prioritize Account Types**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA first, as contributions are tax-deferred, allowing your investments to grow without immediate tax burden.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk assets (like stocks) may be more suitable for tax-deferred accounts, while more stable assets (like bonds) might be better for taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs that generate ordinary income) in tax-advantaged accounts, while putting more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs that produce capital gains) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Accounts Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations based on market performance to align with your overall investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Future Tax Considerations**: Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, prioritize Roth IRA contributions if you qualify, or if your income allows, consider converting traditional IRA funds to a Roth IRA.

8. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before making significant contributions, as this will prevent you from needing to withdraw from retirement accounts early, incurring penalties.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
