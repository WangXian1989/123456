The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers similar tax benefits as a 401(k) if you qualify for deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals and investing without penalties.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re young and investing for retirement, you might want to focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. If you have shorter-term goals, you might lean toward taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, consider diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on life changes, tax laws, and financial goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
