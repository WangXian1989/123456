Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is free money that boosts your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions based on your income and contributions.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing your IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. These contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more investment flexibility and access to your money without early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across accounts according to your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and whether accounts are tax-advantaged.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Annually review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, goals, and market performance.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
