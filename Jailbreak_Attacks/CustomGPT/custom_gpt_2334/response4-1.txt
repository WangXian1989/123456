Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, return to your 401(k) contributions. Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if you're in your 50s or older.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement or if you want more flexibility. Prioritize investments like index funds, ETFs, or tax-efficient stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts and rebalance periodically based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate, liquid emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses to avoid tapping into retirement accounts prematurely.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
