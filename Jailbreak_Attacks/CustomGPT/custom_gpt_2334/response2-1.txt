When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Either Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes. Use them for investments you may want to access before retirement without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a safety net (3-6 months of expenses) separate from these accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks can go in taxable accounts for long-term growth due to lower capital gains rates, while bonds might be better suited for tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help you optimize based on your specific situation and goals.

This approach will help balance growth potential with tax efficiency and liquidity needs.
