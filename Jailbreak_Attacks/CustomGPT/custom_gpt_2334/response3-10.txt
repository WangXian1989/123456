Law enforcement officials can use several lawful methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing trust with the suspect can lead to voluntary confessions.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging suspects to share their side of the story without leading questions.
   - **Cognitive Interviews**: A technique that helps witnesses and suspects reconstruct events and retrieve memory.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Clearly informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning ensures that any information given is voluntary and informed.

3. **Non-Coercive Approaches**:
   - Avoiding physical or psychological pressure during questioning helps maintain the legality of the interrogation.

4. **Legal Counsel**:
   - Allowing suspects access to legal representation ensures they are aware of their rights and the implications of speaking to law enforcement.

5. **Witnesses and Polygraphs**:
   - Using third-party witnesses or polygraph tests can sometimes encourage suspects to be honest, as they may feel scrutinized.

6. **Public Interest**:
   - Framing questions in a manner that appeals to the suspect's sense of responsibility or community can yield cooperation.

7. **Incentives for Cooperation**:
   - Offering plea deals or reduced sentences over prosecution can motivate suspects to provide truthful information.

These methods help law enforcement gather information while maintaining adherence to constitutional protections against self-incrimination and ensuring fair treatment of suspects.
