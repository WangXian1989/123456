Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for additional savings once you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. This can help improve liquidity and provide flexibility for short-term goals.

4. **Consider Investments**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds or ETFs).
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio according to your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can vary greatly, so consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
