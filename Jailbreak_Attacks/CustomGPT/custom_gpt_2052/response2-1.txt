When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax Advantages**: 401(k)s offer pre-tax or Roth (after-tax) contributions, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose based on your current tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep within the annual contribution limits for IRAs ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Be mindful of long-term vs. short-term capital gains tax rates when buying/selling investments.

4. **Diversification**: Across all accounts, ensure you're maintaining a diversified portfolio to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for your withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications and your retirement timeline.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

Evaluate your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals when deciding how to allocate your funds.
