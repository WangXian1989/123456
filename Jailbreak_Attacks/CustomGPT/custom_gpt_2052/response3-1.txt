Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer match; contributions are pre-tax, which may lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold; they offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - For IRAs, ensure youâ€™re within the contribution limits ($6,500 for those under 50 in 2023; $7,500 for those 50 and older).

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Contribute to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) first for upfront tax savings.
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Evaluate Investment Strategies**:
   - Focus on long-term growth investments in retirement accounts (like stocks) since they can benefit from compounding.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or to avoid penalties on early withdrawals.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), regardless of the account type.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocations and contributions to adjust based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, or life stages.

### Conclusion
A common approach might be to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, then fill up a Roth or Traditional IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts as needed. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
