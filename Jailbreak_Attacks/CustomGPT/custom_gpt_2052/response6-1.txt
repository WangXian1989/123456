To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, fund a traditional or Roth IRA for its tax benefits. Prioritize this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on your retirement accounts, which benefit from compound growth and tax deferral.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Utilize these for higher-turnover investments that would incur more taxes if held in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Contribution Limits Awareness**
   - Keep track of yearly contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax benefits while complying with IRS regulations.

By strategically allocating your investments based on these factors, you can optimize your financial growth while minimizing taxes.
