Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key points to consider for each type of account:

### 1. 401(k)
- **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions if your employer offers a match, as it's essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. IRA
- **Flexibility**: IRAs, whether traditional or Roth, often offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.
- **Tax Strategy**: Traditional IRAs defer taxes until withdrawal, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Balance contributions based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 3. Taxable Accounts
- **Investment Growth**: These accounts provide flexibility with no contribution limits. They're beneficial for investments intended for short to mid-term goals.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Recommended Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before diving deep into investments.
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to the match.
- **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the match, contribute to an IRA.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds for a taxable account, focusing on diversified, tax-efficient investments.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
