Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars. Withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free in retirement, which can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains and dividends from taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax and ordinary income tax, respectively. These accounts offer more flexibility but fewer tax advantages than retirement accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your retirement accounts to hold a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, or other assets suitable for your long-term goals.
   - Consider keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, since they generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts. This usually should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: As you get closer to retirement, shift your asset allocation to more conservative investments. Younger investors may benefit from a more aggressive portfolio focused on growth.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. In 2023, for example, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the limit for IRA contributions is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). 

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust your allocations as needed based on life changes, market conditions, or changes to your financial goals.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your unique circumstances.
