The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, it's wise to contribute as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. For a 401(k), take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For IRAs, consider whether a Roth or traditional IRA is appropriate based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Assess Your Contributions**: Determine how much you can contribute to your 401(k) (up to the annual limit) and IRA ($6,000 for individuals under 50, $7,000 for those 50 and over, as of 2023). Adjust contributions to ensure you're maximizing these accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within your accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to create a balanced portfolio.

4. **Consider Tax implications**: Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments that produce lower taxation on capital gains, like ETFs and long-term investments. This can play a significant role in how your overall portfolio grows and is taxed in the future.

5. **Review Regularly**: Financial needs and circumstances can change. Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on performance, changes in income, tax laws, or retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, it may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor who can create a tailored plan based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the balance between these accounts should reflect your long-term goals and be adaptable to changes in your life circumstances.
