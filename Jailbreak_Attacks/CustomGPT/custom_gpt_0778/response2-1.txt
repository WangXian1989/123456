Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed annually. Use this account for investments that generate long-term capital gains or for short-term goals.

### 3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** These accounts are generally best for long-term investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may have higher short-term capital gains or income (like bonds or REITs), which may be taxed at higher rates.

### 5. **Assess Your Timeline:**
   - If you plan to retire earlier, consider allocating more to tax-advantaged accounts early on to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on your changing needs, goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **20-30% in 401(k)** (up to the match)
- **10-20% in Traditional IRA** (if eligible for deduction)
- **20-30% in Roth IRA** (if eligible)
- **20-30% in Taxable Accounts**

### Final Thoughts:
Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances and to ensure you are optimizing your tax situation effectively.
