When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Prioritize Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth), making them ideal for long-term investments. Aim to hold investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for short-term savings, as they don't benefit from tax deferral.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, Roth accounts may be more beneficial since you'll pay taxes now rather than later.
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, focusing on tax-deferred accounts might be advantageous.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts for risk management.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement; consider the sequence of withdrawals to minimize taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively balance growth potential, risk, and tax efficiency in your investments.
