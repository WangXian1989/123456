Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to both a traditional and a Roth IRA for tax diversification.

### 2. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) here, as they'll be taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Hold investments that have the potential for high growth (like stocks), which will benefit from tax deferral.

### 3. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Reassess your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and market conditions at least annually. This ensures you maintain your desired level of risk and return.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - As you approach retirement, think about your withdrawal strategy. Taxable accounts might be tapped first, depending on your tax situation and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your retirement accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15% (max out employer match)
- **Traditional IRA:** 10%
- **Roth IRA:** 10%
- **Taxable Account:** 65% (to maintain liquidity and flexibility)

Adjust according to your individual circumstances and long-term goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
