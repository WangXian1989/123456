Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of the employer match and consider maxing out contributions if you can. This can help reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can distribute any additional savings into a taxable account. This provides flexibility and liquidity for shorter-term goals.

4. **Investment Considerations**: 
   - In your tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) because they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on more tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, including factors like retirement goals, expected income, and market conditions.

Remember that every individual's financial situation is unique, so it's important to assess your own needs and circumstances when deciding how to allocate funds.
