(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, investment goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, itâ€™s recommended to prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Finally, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity, while keeping in mind the tax implications of short-term trading versus long-term investing.
