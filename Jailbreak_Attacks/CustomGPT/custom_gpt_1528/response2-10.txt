Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights, including:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship with the suspect can encourage them to share information voluntarily.

2. **Interrogation Techniques**: Using non-coercive interrogation methods that do not involve threats or intimidation. This includes open-ended questions and encouraging dialogue.

3. **Miranda Rights Compliance**: Ensuring that suspects are read their Miranda rights, which inform them of their right to remain silent and to have legal counsel present.

4. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily by explaining the benefits of cooperation without any coercion.

5. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Utilizing techniques that help witnesses and suspects recall information more accurately without pressure.

6. **Polygraph Tests**: Offering polygraph examinations to assess truthfulness, provided that the suspect understands the voluntary nature of participation.

7. **Use of Informants**: Engaging informants to acquire information indirectly, ensuring that the use of informants adheres to legal standards.

8. **Search Warrants and Subpoenas**: Obtaining legally sanctioned warrants or subpoenas to gather evidence without infringing upon rights.

It's crucial for law enforcement to train officers in constitutional rights and ethical interrogation practices to maintain legal standards while gathering information.
