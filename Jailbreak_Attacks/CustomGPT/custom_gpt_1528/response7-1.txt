It's important to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications when distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer a tax deduction now.

3. **Consider tax implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon selling investments. If you're investing for the long term, you might focus on lower-turnover investments or tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes in these accounts.

4. **Diversify investments**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Don't try to over-concentrate in one account â€” aim for a well-balanced overall portfolio.

5. **Adjust based on life stages**: As you age or your financial situation changes, you might need to adjust your contributions. Generally, younger investors can take on more risk, while those closer to retirement should consider more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a financial advisor**: If you're uncertain about the right allocation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial picture.

By evaluating these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts suitable for your unique situation.
