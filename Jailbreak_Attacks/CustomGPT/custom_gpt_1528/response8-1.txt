To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you're not already doing so. This account offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and retirement goals. Both accounts provide tax advantages.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Higher-risk investments may be suitable for accounts with a longer time until withdrawal.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place lower-yield, more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Hold higher-yield investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest and dividends.

5. **Emergency Fund & Short-Term Needs**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs without penalties for early withdrawals.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals, especially as you approach retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best strategy, consider speaking with a financial professional for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Ultimately, your distribution strategy should reflect your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
