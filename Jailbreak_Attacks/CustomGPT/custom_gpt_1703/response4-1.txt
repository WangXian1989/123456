While I can't provide specific financial advice, I can offer general strategies for distributing money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are a few tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA for long-term savings, as they can provide tax benefits either on contributions or withdrawals.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals. Taxable accounts may be more suitable for short-term goals due to flexibility but might incur capital gains taxes.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, or personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor may help you create a more tailored strategy based on your specific situation.
