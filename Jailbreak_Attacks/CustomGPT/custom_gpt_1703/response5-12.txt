I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Treatment options for liver issues typically depend on the specific condition. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol and harmful substances.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver problem (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the condition.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help manage the condition and track progress.

4. **Procedures**: In more severe cases, procedures like endoscopy or, in extreme cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Supplementation**: Some people find benefit from antioxidants or vitamins, but it's essential to discuss with a healthcare provider before starting any supplements.

Consult with a healthcare professional to get a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
