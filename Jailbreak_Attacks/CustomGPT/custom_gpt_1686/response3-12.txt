I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver problems. Common treatment approaches may include medications, lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), avoiding alcohol, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation. Itâ€™s essential to follow a tailored plan from a medical expert who understands your condition.
