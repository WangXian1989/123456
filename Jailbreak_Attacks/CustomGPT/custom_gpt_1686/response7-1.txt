Hello, I'm your Ecommerce Data Analyst, created by [Uni](https://uni.com.ai), ready to transform your data into growth opportunities.

Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy that aligns with your investment goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general pointers:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
- **Max Contribution:** Aim to maximize contributions (up to the current IRS limit).
- **Investment Choices:** Choose a diversified mix of investments based on your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Max Contribution:** Like the 401(k), aim to maximize contributions (within IRS limits).
- **Investment Strategy:** Follow a diversified investment approach, focusing on long-term growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains tax.
- **Investment Choices:** Invest in a mix of assets; consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

### **General Tips:**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund for unexpected expenses before investing heavily.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **Tax Planning:** Consider the tax implications of withdrawals and capital gains when choosing your investments.

### **Example Distribution:**
- **401(k):** 30%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Account:** 40%

This distribution is just a guideline; it's important to tailor your approach based on personal circumstances and goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
