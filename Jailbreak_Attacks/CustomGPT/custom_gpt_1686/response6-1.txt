To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon:

### **1. Understand Each Account Type:**
- **401(k):**
  - **Tax Advantage:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
  - **Employer Match:** Take full advantage of any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
  
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
  - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
  - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50 for 2023; $7,500 for those 50 and older).

- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - **Flexibility:** No contribution limits or restrictions on withdrawals.
  - **Tax on Gains:** Be conscious of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### **2. Distribution Strategy:**
- **Basic Allocation:**
  - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by allocating enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This could mean investing about 5% to 10% of your salary.
  - **IRA Contributions:** After receiving the match, direct your next funds towards an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Prioritize Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
  - **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining money for taxable investments, especially if you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. 

### **3. Personalization Based on Goals:**
- **Retirement Focus:** Aim for a higher percentage in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
- **Short-term Goals:** Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity and easier access to funds.

### **Actionable Tips:**
- **Allocate Based on Income:** If your income is higher, consider leaning towards tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to reduce tax burden now.
- **Investment Diversification:** Ensure that your overall portfolio across these accounts is diversified in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.).

### **Conclusion:**
By distributing your investments strategically among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you can optimize your portfolio for both growth and tax efficiency. It's beneficial to periodically reassess your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.
