To determine the best way to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):**
     - **Tax Advantage:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
     - **Employer Match:** Take full advantage of employer contributions if available.
     - **Withdrawal Penalties:** Withdrawals before age 59½ may incur penalties.

   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):**
     - **Tax Treatment:**
        - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
        - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
     - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - **Flexibility:** No restrictions on access to funds, but you’ll pay capital gains tax on profits.
     - **Investment Choices:** Greater freedom in investment options compared to retirement accounts.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** If you need access to cash within a few years, consider putting more in taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on maximizing contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs for retirement savings. 

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Analyze your current tax bracket and projected future tax bracket to determine where to place contributions. 
   - For higher income years, consider maximizing tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to lower taxable income.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Aim to have a mix of investments across all accounts to navigate market fluctuations.
   - Consider risk tolerance and time horizon for each pot of money.

### 5. **Allocation Recommendations:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match** in 401(k) first – typically up to 15% of your salary.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**, especially if you qualify for tax benefits.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts** as needed for liquidity.

### Example of Distribution:
| Account Type     | Suggested Contribution Percentage |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| 401(k)           | 15% (up to employer match)       |
| Traditional IRA  | 10% (if eligible)                |
| Roth IRA         | 10% (if eligible)                |
| Taxable Account   | 5-10% (as needed)                |

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjust:**
   - Reassess your allocations yearly to align with changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

By following this structured approach, you can optimize your allocations towards retirement and taxable accounts based on your individual circumstances. If you have any specific financial figures or goals, I can help create a more tailored strategy!
