Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs might offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Balance Risk and Growth**: Keep a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can vary greatly, so it might be beneficial to get tailored advice.

By understanding your financial goals and tax situation, you can create a balanced distribution that works best for you.
