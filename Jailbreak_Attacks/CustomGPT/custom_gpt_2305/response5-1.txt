It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money among different investment accounts. Hereâ€™s a straightforward approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match if available; this is essentially "free money." Consider contributing enough to benefit from the match, and then aim to contribute the maximum allowed if you can. This account typically offers tax advantages and can grow tax-deferred until retirement.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Contributing to an IRA can be beneficial for diversifying your tax situation in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not fit in your tax-advantaged accounts, like individual stocks or certain mutual funds. Focus on holding investments long-term to minimize capital gains taxes, and consider using tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### General Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have a sufficient emergency fund set aside before aggressive investing.
- **Diversification**: Include a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to spread risk.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
