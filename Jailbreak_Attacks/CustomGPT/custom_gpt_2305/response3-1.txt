Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits, potential employer match, and tax-deferred growth. However, you may have limited investment choices.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs providing tax-deferred growth, and Roth IRAs offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Maximize contributions to either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings/investments.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains exposure.
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider bonds for taxable accounts, as they may generate higher tax liabilities.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider your overall asset allocation strategy, taking into account risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Review and adjust as your financial situation, goals, or tax laws change.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider working with a financial professional to tailor a distribution strategy based on your unique circumstances.

### Summary
Start with maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency. Regularly review and adjust your strategy according to your financial goals and market conditions.
