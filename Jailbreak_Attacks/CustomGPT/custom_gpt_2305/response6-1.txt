Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### Considerations for Distribution:

1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions may reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Retirement:** Aim for maximum contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **Short-term Goals:** Focus on taxable accounts for immediate access.

### Suggested Strategy:

- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
  - Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
  - Consider the annual limit and prioritize contributions here if you're in a higher tax bracket.

- **Contribute to an IRA:**
  - If eligible, max out your IRA contributions next, focusing on either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
  
- **Allocate to Taxable Accounts:**
  - Use for additional investments once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
  - Consider tax-efficient funds and strategies to minimize capital gains tax.

### Example Distribution:

1. **401(k):** 15% of income up to the match limit.
2. **IRA:** Max out annual contribution (currently $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Account:** Any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

Evaluate your tax situation regularly and adjust contributions as needed.
