To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Ensure you’re contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s essentially free money.
  
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts often have tax benefits that can boost growth.

3. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both the 401(k) and IRA to optimize your tax advantages.

4. **Risk Diversification**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals when allocating funds within those accounts. Stocks for growth, bonds for stability, etc.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, divert additional savings to taxable accounts for more flexibility and access.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation regularly based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, talking to a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.

This strategy can help you minimize taxes while maximizing growth potential!
