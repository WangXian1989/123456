To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first to take advantage of tax deferrals.
- **Utilize Roth Options When Possible**: If available, Roth accounts can provide tax-free growth.

### 2. Strategic Withdrawals
- **Delay Taxable Withdrawals**: Keep investments in taxable accounts for later years when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
- **Consider Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Plan for withdrawals from your 401(k) and traditional IRA after age 72 to avoid penalties.

### Further Considerations
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on risk tolerance.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize savings effectively.

Evaluate your financial goals and adjust your strategy accordingly for optimal growth.
