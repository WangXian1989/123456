Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income right now. Consider maxing this out if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A Traditional IRA can also be beneficial for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are likely to generate capital gains or interest income. This can provide flexibility and liquidity, but keep in mind the tax implications.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different investment strategies may apply, emphasizing growth in tax-advantaged accounts and income generation in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will access funds in retirement, balancing between accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as needed due to changes in market conditions, life circumstances, or tax laws.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
