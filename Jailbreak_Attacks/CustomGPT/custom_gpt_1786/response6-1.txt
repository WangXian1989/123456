To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that have favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. 

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals considering tax implications. Tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can provide flexibility.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific financial situation.
