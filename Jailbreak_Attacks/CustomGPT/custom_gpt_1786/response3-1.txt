Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, since this is "free money." Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA if you want the immediate tax deduction.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxed income (like long-term capital gains) or for savings for short-term goals since you can access them before retirement without penalties.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Invest in higher-growth assets like stocks, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Debt**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before fully investing in these vehicles.
   - Pay off high-interest debt before contributing heavily to retirement accounts.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Closer to retirement, focus on more stable investments and ensure you have enough liquidity.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach tailored to your financial situation, lifespan, and goals will help you distribute your money effectively. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
