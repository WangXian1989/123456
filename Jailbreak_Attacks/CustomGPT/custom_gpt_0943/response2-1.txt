Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, age, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions upfront, while a Roth IRA has tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts have different tax treatments on capital gains and dividends. They provide flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Set Contribution Priorities**:
   - First, contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
   - Then, fund an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more liquidity and investment flexibility.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) and use taxable accounts for long-term growth assets (like stocks) to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your strategy annually to ensure it aligns with changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial professional.

This strategy balances tax benefits, growth potential, and liquidity based on individual circumstances.
