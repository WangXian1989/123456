The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically, contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. This account often has employer matching, so contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth and contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, helpful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer flexibility for withdrawals and donâ€™t have contribution limits, but investment returns are taxed annually.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max out your 401(k) match first:** Ensure you're contributing enough to receive any employer match as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider IRAs next:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Then, fund taxable accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or if you have maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Consider your tax bracket:** Place less tax-efficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversify your portfolio:** Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - **Revisit your allocations periodically:** As your financial situation changes, adjust your contributions and investment strategy accordingly.
   - **Tax implications:** Be aware of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and weigh them against the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to max out the employer match.
- **IRA:** If eligible, contribute the maximum allowable amount.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for investments, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
