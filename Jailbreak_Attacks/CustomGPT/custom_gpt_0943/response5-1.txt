Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you believe you’ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: 
   - If you’re in your peak earning years, putting more into tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) might be beneficial.
   - If you anticipate a lower tax bracket in retirement or want to take advantage of tax-free growth, consider increasing contributions to a Roth IRA.

4. **Build Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalty, though be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Allocation**: 
   - Within each account type, ensure an appropriate asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Typically, retirement accounts can favor growth investments, while taxable accounts may require more conservative investments to manage taxes effectively.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: As your financial situation or tax laws change, revisit your distribution strategy.

It's often wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
