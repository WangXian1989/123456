Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now. Contributions reduce your taxable income, and the investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

3. **Roth IRA Consideration**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for extra cash flow needs before retirement. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments based on the account type. For tax-deferred accounts, consider holding assets with higher growth potential. For taxable accounts, prefer tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: As you get closer to retirement, gradually shift from higher-risk investments to more stable ones, particularly in your 401(k) and IRA.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial situations vary widely, so consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice. 

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
