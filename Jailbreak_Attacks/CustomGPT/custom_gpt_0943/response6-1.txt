Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Traditional/Roth IRA**: If possible, contribute to an IRA next. Choose between Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) for investments that may generate significant taxable income, such as bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains, or if you plan to access funds before retirement age.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan for Retirement**: Have a strategy for withdrawing funds that minimizes taxes, potentially starting with taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a tailored strategy based on your unique situation.
