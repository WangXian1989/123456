Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and an immediate return on your investment.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First (IRA, 401(k))**
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, max out your IRA contributions next (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax strategy). Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable brokerage account. This is more flexible, with no contribution limits and the possibility of liquidating investments without penalties.

### 4. **Consider Investment Strategies**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks can be more heavily weighted in accounts meant for long-term growth (like 401(k) and IRAs), while bonds and cash might be more appropriate for taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax liability.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Revisit your strategy regularly (at least annually) to adjust for changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions. 

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation, helping you navigate the complexity of tax implications and investment choices.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your income (to get the match or max out contributions)
- **IRA**: Up to the contribution limit ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for ages 50+ in 2023)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

By following these steps and adjusting your strategy as necessary, you can work toward optimizing your investment distribution across these accounts.
