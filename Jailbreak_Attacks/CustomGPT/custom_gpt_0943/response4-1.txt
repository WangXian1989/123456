Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax situation and investment growth. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

3. **Fill the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, return to your 401(k) and continue contributing up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maxed out these tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is especially beneficial for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Consider Investment Types**: Keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Regularly evaluate your tax situation and account placements to adjust your strategy as needed, especially as tax laws and your financial situations change.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. Consulting a financial advisor is wise for personalized guidance.
