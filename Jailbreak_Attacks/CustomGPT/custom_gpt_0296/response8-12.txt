I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies help track liver health and function.

4. **Nutritional Support**: Consulting a dietitian may be beneficial to create a liver-friendly diet.

5. **Weight Management**: For conditions like fatty liver disease, losing weight can help reduce liver fat.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.
