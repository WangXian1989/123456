To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Tax Advantages
- **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute the maximum to your 401(k) to benefit from employer matches and tax deferral.
- **Roth IRA Potential**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### Investment Strategy
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Utilize taxable accounts for more liquid investments, enabling access without penalties before retirement age.

### Withdrawal Strategy
- **Tax-Efficient Withdrawals**: In retirement, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

### Ongoing Review
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations yearly to maintain your desired risk profile.

By strategically distributing your funds across these accounts, you can optimize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
