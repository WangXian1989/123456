The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Funding an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts are flexible and can be used for shorter-term goals.

4. **Investment Mix**: Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
