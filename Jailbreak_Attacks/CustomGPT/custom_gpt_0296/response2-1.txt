Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions—this is free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, consider contributing to these accounts after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be advantageous for long-term holdings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends. This can help manage your tax liability more effectively.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxable income in your taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment time frame.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
