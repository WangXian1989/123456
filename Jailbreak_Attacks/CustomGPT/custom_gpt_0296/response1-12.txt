For liver problems, treatment options depend on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Medications**: Antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease, or medications to manage symptoms.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Avoid alcohol, maintain a healthy diet, and regular exercise.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function.
4. **Dietary Management**: Low-sodium diets for cirrhosis or weight management for fatty liver disease.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
