Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, prioritizing pre-tax accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) can lower your taxable income.  
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing in long-term retirement accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Consider your overall asset allocation and risk tolerance. 
   - Typically, riskier investments (e.g., stocks) might be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (e.g., bonds) can be in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Assess your long-term financial goals and timeline. Think about when you’ll need to access these funds.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your allocation based on your specific circumstances and goals.

By strategically prioritizing contributions, you can effectively manage your money across these accounts.
