When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can also be tax-deductible; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but donâ€™t have the same tax advantages. Capital gains will be taxed when you sell investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Consider stocks in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains treatment and bonds or fixed-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter interest income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Annual Contributions**: Make sure to regularly assess and adjust your contributions based on changing financial situations, income, and retirement goals.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your specific circumstances.
