Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first; it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation (pre-tax vs. post-tax benefits).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This is flexible for withdrawals but wonâ€™t have tax advantages.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be allocated according to your overall strategy.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient (like REITs or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to optimize tax liability.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Regularly reassess your allocation based on life changes, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good idea for personalized guidance.
