Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Max out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) if you're eligible. They often provide tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These accounts reduce your taxable income now but taxes will be due when you withdraw.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are received. Focus on investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may not yield immediate income (like growth stocks) to defer taxes.
   - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts where possible.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - In retirement, have a plan for which accounts to withdraw from first to optimize taxes. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts can be beneficial.

### 5. **Review Annually**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio, ensuring it aligns with your risk tolerance, changing goals, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.
