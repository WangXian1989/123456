Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends. Prioritize these assets after maximizing retirement accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust contributions based on life changes (like marriage, children, etc.) and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your circumstances.
