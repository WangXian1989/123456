Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before investing heavily in taxable accounts. The annual contribution limits (as of 2023) are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
