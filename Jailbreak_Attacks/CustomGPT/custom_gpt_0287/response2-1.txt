Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on your current vs. future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for flexibility and short-term goals. You'll pay capital gains taxes on profits, but you can access funds anytime without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Adjust for Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts if you're in a lower tax bracket.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your savings potential.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your entire financial picture.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio.
