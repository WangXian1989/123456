To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match level first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-efficient Withdrawals**: Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Good for higher tax brackets; contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged options. Taxable accounts are more flexible but less tax efficient.

4. **Evaluate Investment Goals**: Adjust contributions based on your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for more liquid cash needs and tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

5. **Rebalance as Necessary**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax implications.
