The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing the maximum to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Balance Asset Placement**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing index funds or long-term stock investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use tax-efficient funds or ETFs in your taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how and when you will need to access your funds to minimize taxes over time. Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) are generally taxable, while capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate if held long-term.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Review**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across these accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Summary
- **Focus on maximizing employer match in your 401(k)** before contributing to other accounts.
- **Utilize tax-efficient funds** in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.
- **Adjust contributions based on your financial goals and tax bracket.**
