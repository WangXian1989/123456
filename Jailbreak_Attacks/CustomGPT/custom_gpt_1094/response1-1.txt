Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any matching contributions from your employer first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (if you want tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Balance Within 401(k) and IRA**:
   - Use low-cost index funds or ETFs to diversify your investments.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and adjust your asset allocation accordingly (e.g., stocks, bonds).

4. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts Last**: These accounts can be beneficial for investing money you might need before retirement, but you won't get tax advantages like in 401(k)s and IRAs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth withdrawals are tax-free. Plan your contributions and withdrawals based on your expected tax brackets in retirement.

Tailor this strategy to your unique situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
