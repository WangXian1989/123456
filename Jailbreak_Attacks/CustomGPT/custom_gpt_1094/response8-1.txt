Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial for retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - **401(k)** contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider this if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable accounts** are best for savings goals not related to retirement, as they offer flexibility and can be taxed at lower capital gains rates if held for more than a year.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts. This can help manage risk and optimize returns.

5. **Tax-Efficient Withdrawals**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from your taxable accounts first to let your tax-advantaged accounts grow. After that, consider your 401(k) and traditional IRA, as those will be taxed upon withdrawal.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, and tax laws change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
