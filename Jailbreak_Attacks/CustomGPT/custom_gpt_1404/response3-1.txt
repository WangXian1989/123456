Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. Suitable for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax treatment as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and no contribution limits, but youâ€™ll pay capital gains tax on your earnings. Useful for short-term goals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

4. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before aggressively investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Adjust for Age and Goals**: As you age and approach retirement, gradually shift your asset allocation towards more conservative investments in each account type.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your investment allocations and adjust based on market conditions and changes in personal circumstances.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your specific situation.
