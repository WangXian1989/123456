The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Take advantage of any tax benefits since contributions are made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) and grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify (income limits apply). This allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA as well, especially if you can deduct contributions on your tax return.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use a taxable account for investments you might need to access before retirement or for short-term goals (like buying a home).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments such as index funds, ETFs, or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts based on your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy. Different accounts may benefit from different asset allocations.
   - Stocks generally offer more growth potential, whereas bonds can provide stability.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy ahead of retirement. Typically, it’s tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

6. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Monitor and reassess your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to fit your specific needs.
