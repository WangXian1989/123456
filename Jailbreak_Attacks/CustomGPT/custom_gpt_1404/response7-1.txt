Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once youâ€™re maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If you still have funds available after maxing out your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) to the maximum allowable limit. This can help reduce your taxable income now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can offer more flexibility in terms of accessing funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold at a profit.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts, while putting less tax-efficient investments like bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Make sure to regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
