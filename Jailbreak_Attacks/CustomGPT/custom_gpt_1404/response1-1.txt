Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money." After that, consider maxing out your contributions if you can.

2. **IRA:** Next, look at opening a traditional or Roth IRA. Depending on your income level and tax situation, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. These provide flexibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

**Considerations:**
- **Tax Impact:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to reduce your current tax burden.
- **Investment Goals:** Align your investments with your short-term and long-term financial goals.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

Consulting with a financial advisor could also provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
