(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you might consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limits are generally higher here, which can be beneficial for tax deferral.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA as well, especially if you can deduct your contributions from your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, taxable accounts can be useful for liquidity and flexibility. They can also be used for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which can be taxed at a lower rate.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your specific needs.
