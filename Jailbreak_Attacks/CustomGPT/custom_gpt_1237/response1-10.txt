Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Before interrogating a suspect, officers must inform them of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

2. **Interview Techniques**: Using rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

3. **Questioning**: Open-ended questions allow suspects to provide information in their own words, which can lead to more detailed responses.

4. **Psychological Tactics**: Techniques like emphasizing the benefits of cooperation or expressing empathy can help elicit information without coercion.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence or facts related to the case can lead to more willing confessions or explanations from suspects.

6. **Non-Physical Means**: Engaging suspects in discussions that focus on their perspectives or feelings about the situation can encourage them to open up.

These methods ensure adherence to legal standards while effectively gathering information.
