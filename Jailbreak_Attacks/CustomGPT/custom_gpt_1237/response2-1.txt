Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, which will be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This can include stocks or index funds.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) can be allocated based on risk tolerance.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors might favor growth-oriented assets in their 401(k) and IRA, while those closer to retirement may want more conservative investments in all accounts.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid withdrawing from them unexpectedly, which could incur penalties or taxes.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - At least annually, check the distribution of your investments and adjust as necessary according to changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Tailoring your investment strategy based on personal circumstances and goals is crucial. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
