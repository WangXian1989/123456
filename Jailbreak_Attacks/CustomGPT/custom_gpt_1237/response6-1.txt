Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guide to help you optimize your distribution:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next for tax benefits. The choice between them depends on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

### 2. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Based on Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need within 5 years to avoid penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Consider Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to employer-selected funds, but typically offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Gives you more flexibility with investment choices, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for more liquid investments and potentially higher-return opportunities but be mindful of tax implications on gains.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your investments to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Final Tips
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice specific to your circumstances can optimize your strategy.
- **Stay Informed About Tax Laws**: Changes can impact your investment strategy significantly.

This structured approach can help maximize your investment growth while minimizing taxes.
