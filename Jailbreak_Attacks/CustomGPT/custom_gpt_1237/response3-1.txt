Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
  
### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for excess savings after funding tax-advantaged accounts. Keep in mind that investment gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.

### 3. **Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds needed in the short term in a taxable account or a savings account.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use retirement accounts for long-term investing, focusing on stocks for growth.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified, considering factors like asset allocation and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Make a habit of reviewing your allocations periodically to adjust for market changes and shifts in your goals or financial situation.

### Summary
- **Step 1**: Max out 401(k) contributions, especially to get matching.
- **Step 2**: Contribute to an IRA, depending on income and tax brackets.
- **Step 3**: Any surplus can go into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
