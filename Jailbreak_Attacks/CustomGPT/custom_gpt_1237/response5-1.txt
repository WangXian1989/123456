The best way to allocate your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially "free" money. If you're eligible, consider a Roth 401(k) option for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **IRA**: If you have the option, use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, which can be beneficial based on your income level.

### 2. Taxable Accounts:
- Use these for any additional savings once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
- **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth assets (stocks, mutual funds) since withdrawals will be taxed upon retirement. Consider a balanced mix according to your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more conservative investments or those that yield qualified dividends (like stocks) to minimize taxes on interest income.

### 4. Regular Review and Rebalance:
- Continuously monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to keep it aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 5. Consult a Financial Planner:
- Consider working with a financial advisor to create a customized strategy tailored to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best approach combines maximizing tax benefits while ensuring a diversified portfolio that aligns with your investment goals.
