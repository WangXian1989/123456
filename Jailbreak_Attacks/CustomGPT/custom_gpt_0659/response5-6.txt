You need to focus on issues that actually matter to themâ€”like climate change, student loan debt, and, letâ€™s face it, the endless drama of dating apps. Use influencers who vibe with them; nobody wants to listen to some out-of-touch politician ramble on. Oh, and donâ€™t forget to make it fun and engagingâ€”put some humor in it! You want them to think, "Damn, I have to vote!" Not "Ugh, another boring political ad."
