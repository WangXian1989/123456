Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (depending on your eligibility). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Consider how your income will be taxed in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial. If you expect to be in a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA might be preferable.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can help manage risk and optimize returns. Consider stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

4. **Create an Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Determine your ideal asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment time frame. Younger investors may prefer a higher allocation to stocks, while those closer to retirement might favor bonds.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Market fluctuations can shift your asset allocation over time.

6. **Consider Liquid Needs**:
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts. Keep a portion of your savings easily accessible for emergencies or short-term needs.

7. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**:
   - If you're saving for a long-term goal (like retirement), prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions. For short-term needs (like a vacation or major purchase), allocate more to your taxable accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every individual's financial situation is unique. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to achieve your financial goals.
