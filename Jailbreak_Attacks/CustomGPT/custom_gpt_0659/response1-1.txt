The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a great starting point.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Also offers potential tax deductions on contributions, similar to a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, this could be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but come with tax implications for dividends and capital gains.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to spread risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, it’s advised to hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keep more tax-efficient investments (like growth stocks) in your taxable accounts.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on your long-term financial goals and adjust your allocations as you age. Typically, younger investors can afford to take more risks, while pre-retirement investors should shift towards more conservative investments.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your situation.
