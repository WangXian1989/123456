To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. Tax Efficiency:
- **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred. This can significantly enhance your long-term growth, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
- **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Additional Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributions to taxable accounts. This can provide liquidity, and any capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 2. Asset Allocation:
- **Place Tax-inefficient Investments in Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Hold high-dividend stocks, bonds, or real estate investment trusts (REITs) in 401(k) or IRA accounts to avoid immediate tax liabilities on income.
- **Utilize Tax-efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Invest in index funds or ETFs in your taxable accounts, as these typically generate fewer taxable events and qualify for capital gains treatment.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Stay informed on the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA accounts to maximize growth opportunities.
- **Adjust for Your Tax Situation**: If you anticipate changes in your income or tax situation, reassess your strategy annually to ensure optimal allocations.

### Key Takeaway:
Developing a strategic approach towards asset placement in your investment accounts while considering tax implications can lead to enhanced wealth accumulation.
