To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often has an employer match, tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but flexibility in withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Contribute to your 401(k) and traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement.

4. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes, adjusting as you age.
