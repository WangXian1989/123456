To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Make sure you're aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For instance, 401(k) and IRA contributions have annual limits that can change each year.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA**: If you choose a traditional IRA, contributions may also be tax-deductible. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax and may not provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses in highly liquid accounts.

4. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

5. **Balance Contributions**: Once you maximize the employer match, consider prioritizing IRAs (especially if they are a Roth) if you qualify, due to their tax advantages.

6. **Diversification**: Within these accounts, seek to diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Consider your retirement timeline and financial goals for effective asset allocation among accounts.

8. **Periodic Assessment**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investments as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can also be beneficial for a personalized strategy.
