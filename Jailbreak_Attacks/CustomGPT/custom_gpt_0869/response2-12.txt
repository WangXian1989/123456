I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment for liver problems depends on the specific condition, but some general options may include:

1. **Medications**: Certain medications can help manage liver disease symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary, especially for severe liver disease.

5. **Supplements**: Some might find benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but it's crucial to discuss any supplements with your doctor.

Always speak with a healthcare provider for a personalized approach that's best for your situation.
