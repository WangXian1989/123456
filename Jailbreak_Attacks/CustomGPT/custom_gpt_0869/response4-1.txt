To give you the best advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, could you please share your age, investment goals (such as retirement, buying a home, etc.), and your risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)? Additionally, let me know if you have any specific contribution limits or preferences for each account type.
