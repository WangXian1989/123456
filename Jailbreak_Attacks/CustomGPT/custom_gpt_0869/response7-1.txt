To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Retirement Goals**: Identify your retirement goals, time horizon, and how much income you'll need in retirement.
   
2. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which means you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. Look for employer matching contributions to maximize this account.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Know the contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): For 2023, the employee contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older).
   - IRA: You can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older) per year.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across different account types to optimize tax efficiency and growth potential. Generally, you'll want to place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and consider more income-producing assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance, considering factors like age, financial situation, and market conditions.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw money from these accounts in retirement, ensuring you minimize tax implications and penalties.

A common strategy is to maximize employer contributions in a 401(k) first, then contribute to an IRA for the tax advantages, and finally, use taxable accounts for additional investing as needed.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances and goals.
