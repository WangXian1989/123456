To give you the best recommendations for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I'd first need to understand a few things:

1. **What is your current age and retirement age?**
2. **What are your financial goals? Are you focused more on retirement savings, tax savings, or short-term investments?**
3. **What is your current income and tax bracket?**
4. **Do you have any specific preferences or restrictions regarding risk tolerance for your investments?**

Once I have this information, I can provide tailored advice!
