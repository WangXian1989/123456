I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as a healthier diet, weight management, limiting alcohol intake, and medications to address specific conditions. In some cases, more advanced treatments like liver transplantation might be necessary, depending on the severity of the issue. Always prioritize speaking with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
