To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. The annual contribution limit for 401(k) accounts is typically higher than that for IRAs.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maxing out any employer match, contribute to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation). IRAs often have tax advantages depending on your income and the type of IRA you choose.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've prioritized your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals since funds in these accounts aren't subject to penalties for early withdrawal (unlike retirement accounts).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account. For instance, funds from a traditional IRA or 401(k) are taxed as income upon withdrawal, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, consider a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Equities, bonds, mutual funds, and index funds each have different risk profiles and potential returns.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and any changes in your financial situation, goals, or risk tolerance. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your situation, seeking guidance from a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations fitting your financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and strategic approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
