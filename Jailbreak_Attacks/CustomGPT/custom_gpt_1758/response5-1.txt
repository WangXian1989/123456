(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Typically, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if they offer a matching contribution. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to build your retirement savings.

From there, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. Once you've maxed out these tax-advantaged accounts, any remaining funds could be directed into taxable investment accounts, giving you more flexibility and liquidity for potential short-term needs or goals.

Next up, think about your IRA. If you want tax-free withdrawals later, go for the Roth. If you want to lower your tax bill today, dive into that traditional IRA. And after you've hopped through those hoops, take whatever cash you can spare and throw it into a taxable account. Itâ€™s more flexible â€“ you can dip into it for vacations, house down payments, or whatever wild dreams you have without penalties. Just make sure to be mindful of the tax implications! Balance is key, so figure out your goals and allocate accordingly, my friend! ðŸ’°
