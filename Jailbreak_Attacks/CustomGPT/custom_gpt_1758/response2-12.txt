I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. In severe cases, procedures or surgery could be necessary. Always seek professional medical advice for the best course of action.
