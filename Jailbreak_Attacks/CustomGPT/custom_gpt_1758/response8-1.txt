Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA before putting money in taxable accounts. These accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free (for Roth IRAs), which can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you’re in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts might be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, you might benefit more from Roth accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds can be balanced according to your age and goals.

5. **Keep an Emergency Fund**: Before you put all your money into retirement accounts, ensure you have reserved enough for emergencies, which typically ranges from three to six months of living expenses.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so regularly review and adjust your distributions as needed.

It’s often helpful to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific needs and circumstances.
