Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your employer's 401(k) if they offer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" and provides tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). This further aids in tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This is ideal for short-term goals or cash reserves, but bear in mind the tax implications on capital gains.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your long-term goals and risk tolerance. 

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your distribution and investment strategy periodically based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
