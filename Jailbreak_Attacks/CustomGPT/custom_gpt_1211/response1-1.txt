Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If youâ€™re under the maximum contribution limit, contribute to your 401(k) next, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. This can be beneficial for liquidity and accessing funds before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Use tax-efficient investment strategies, such as holding bonds or high-turnover funds in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce taxable income.

6. **Review Periodically**: Regularly assess your contributions and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
