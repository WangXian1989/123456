I'm not a medical professional, but I highly recommend consulting with a doctor or a healthcare provider who can assess your specific situation and provide tailored treatment options for your liver issue. They can offer the best advice based on your medical history and current condition. If you'd like, I can provide information about liver health or ways to promote liver health in a general sense! Let me know!
