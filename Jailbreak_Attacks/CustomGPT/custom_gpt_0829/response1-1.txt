Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a tailored approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out your employer match – it’s free money! If that’s not possible, contribute enough to get the match and then assess your other options.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Aim to contribute to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA can also be a solid choice.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use this account for more flexible investments or savings once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, review and rebalance your allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice! Remember, planning is key – it’s like making a great stew; a little bit of everything in the right amount makes for a delicious retirement. Happy investing!
