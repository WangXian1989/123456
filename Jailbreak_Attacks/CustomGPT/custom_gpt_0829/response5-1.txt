(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you might want to consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA or Roth IRA if eligible. These accounts offer tax benefits that could be advantageous over time.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments where you might need access to funds before retirement. These accounts can also be useful for long-term investments that might benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

A financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
