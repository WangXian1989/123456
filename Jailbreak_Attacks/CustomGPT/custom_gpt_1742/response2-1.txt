When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some considerations to keep in mind:

### 1. **Understanding Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**:
     - Employer-sponsored retirement plan.
     - Tax advantages: contributions may be pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
     - Contribution limits are higher compared to IRAs.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
     - Individual savings plan with tax advantages.
     - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible.
     - Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, subject to conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Invest in stocks, mutual funds, etc., outside of retirement tax advantages.
     - No contribution limits, but capital gains and dividends are taxable.

### 2. **Assessing Your Goals**
   - **Short-term needs versus long-term growth**: If you have short-term savings goals, prioritize taxable accounts. For long-term retirement savings, focus more on 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - **Tax strategy**: Consider your current and expected future tax bracket when investing in taxable versus tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Fund an IRA Next**:
     - Contribute maximum allowable amounts to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on eligibility and preferences.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can be allocated to a taxable account. This offers flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but you'll need to manage tax implications.

### 4. **Sample Allocation**
Hereâ€™s a hypothetical distribution layout based on typical financial advice:
- **401(k)**: 50% of total retirement savings
- **IRA**: 30% of total retirement savings
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% of total investments

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
- Check your investment performance, tax implications, and adjust contributions annually or upon a significant life change (job change, increase in income, etc.).

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
For a personalized strategy, consider reaching out to a financial advisor to align your investment choices with your specific financial situation and goals.

This approach allows you not only to maximize your tax advantages but also to maintain liquidity for more immediate needs. If you have specific numbers or percentages you'd like to discuss, feel free to share, and I can provide more tailored advice!
