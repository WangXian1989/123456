To provide you with tailored advice on your financial distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors such as your retirement goals, current age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here's a structured approach to help you:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Short-term needs:** Money you may need in the next 1-5 years.
   - **Long-term goals:** Retirement age and desired living standard in retirement.

### 2. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan often with matching contributions.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account, tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts without tax advantages, suitable for flexible access.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (plus $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No limits, but consider the investment and tax implications.

### 4. **Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions First:** Especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **Contribute to IRAs Next:** After your 401(k) has been maxed out, consider a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income tax bracket.
   - **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts:** Use these accounts for investments you may need access to sooner, while keeping an eye on tax implications.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:** 
   - Review your asset allocation based on your life changes and market conditions.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Understand how withdrawals from each account type will affect your tax situation in retirement.

### Example Distribution:
| Account Type   | Suggested Allocation (%) |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| 401(k)         | 50%                       |
| IRA            | 30%                       |
| Taxable Accounts| 20%                       |

### Final Tips:
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
- Keep an eye on investment fees and performance within each account.
