When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a traditional 401(k) match, prioritize contributions here after getting the full match.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and income limits.

3. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Impact**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions might lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for savings goals with more liquid needs (like buying a house or early retirement) since they don't have the same withdrawal restrictions as retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation Consideration**: Diversify how your investments are distributed across your accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to hold higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically revisit your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and changing tax considerations.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
