Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This can provide flexibility and liquidity, though be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. Consider stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations and make adjustments based on market conditions and your personal financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific needs and goals.
