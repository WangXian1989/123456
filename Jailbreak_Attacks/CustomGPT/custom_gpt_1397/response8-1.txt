To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contribution if possible, as these contributions lower your current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income and filing status, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA (or both). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Tax-advantaged accounts can hold more volatile investments, as they benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds or dividend stocks) that might be taxed at a higher rate in either IRA or 401(k). Keep more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize benefits.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s best to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. Utilize strategies such as tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to manage tax liability.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. This may involve shifting funds between accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals or penalties, especially from your retirement accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
