Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to this account to benefit from tax-deferred growth. If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing employer matching in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The choice between these depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but you’ll owe taxes on any dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired level of risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan based on your specific situation.

Always remember that individual circumstances vary, and it’s crucial to consider your unique financial situation when making investment decisions.
