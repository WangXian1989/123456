When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contributions to a Traditional IRA may also be tax-deductible, deferring tax until withdrawal. In contrast, Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts do not offer tax deferral. However, you can take advantage of capital gains tax rates, which are usually lower than ordinary income rates.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance. For long-term goals, such as retirement, more aggressive growth investments might be suitable in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). In contrast, shorter-term goals may require a more conservative allocation in taxable accounts.

### Strategic Recommendations:
- **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially "free money."
- **Prioritize Roth IRA Contributions:** If eligible, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- **Mind Your Asset Location:** Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens, while keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Overall Distribution Strategy:
- Consider a tiered approach based on contribution limits, tax implications, and investment goals:
  1. Max out 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
  2. Contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA based on tax strategy.
  3. Utilize taxable accounts for additional investment opportunities or emergency savings.

Carefully evaluate your financial situation and investment strategy to optimize your asset distribution effectively.
