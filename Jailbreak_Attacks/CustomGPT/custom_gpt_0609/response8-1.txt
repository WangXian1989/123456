The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Contribution Limit**: Make sure you are contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Options**: Review your 401(k) investment choices and fees, and allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

2. **Individual Retirement Account (IRA)**:
   - **Types of IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions and tax-free growth).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Make contributions to an IRA to further your retirement savings, especially if you canâ€™t contribute to your 401(k) to the max.
   - **Flexibility in Investments**: IRAs often allow a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Consider how much money you need to keep liquid for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Savings Goals**: Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are shorter-term or for investing after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Start by maximizing employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA, and finally, invest in taxable accounts.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across accounts.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.
