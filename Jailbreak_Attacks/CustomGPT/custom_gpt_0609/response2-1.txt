Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize maxing out your contributions to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider traditional or Roth IRAs based on your income levels and tax situation. If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, longer-term investments can be more aggressive, while short-term savings might be more conservative.
   - Consider asset allocation across accounts. Some investors choose to hold bonds in taxable accounts and stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications on interest income.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Remember that distributions from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts may be more suitable for investments that generate lower capital gains taxes (like index funds) or tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds).

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types to reduce risk.

5. **Adjust for Withdrawals**: 
   - As you approach retirement, consider where to pull money from based on your tax situation. Taxable accounts might be tapped first for living expenses in a lower-income year.

6. **Periodic Review**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
