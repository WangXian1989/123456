To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there’s a company match. This is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and preference for tax treatment).

2. **Evaluate Tax Considerations:** Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are typically made pre-tax, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement. In contrast, Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate taxable income, such as bonds or high-turnover mutual funds, to avoid being taxed on income from these investments in a tax-advantaged account.

3. **Consider Your Investment Time Horizon:** Allocate funds based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. Longer-term investments can take advantage of the tax-deferred growth in 401(k) and IRA accounts. In taxable accounts, consider investing in more conservative or dividend-paying investments if you anticipate needing the funds sooner.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts:** Ensure that your overall portfolio remains diversified, balancing across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type. This approach helps manage risk while pursuing your investment goals.

5. **Regular Re-assessment:** Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change. Adjust your contributions and investments to stay aligned with your goals.

6. **Tax Efficiency:** Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Plan to withdraw from accounts strategically in retirement to minimize your tax burden.
