I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may help manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help prevent further liver damage.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver protection.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver health and disease progression.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or supplements, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

6. **Potential Procedures**: In severe cases, treatments may include procedures like liver biopsy for diagnosis or a transplant if the liver is severely damaged.

Always seek direct medical advice for specific treatments tailored to your condition.
