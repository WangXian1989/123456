The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions (up to the annual limit) for tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that generate capital gains, like index funds or ETFs, which are taxed favorably.
   - Consider keeping short-term investments (which are taxed at higher rates) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings in a separate fund before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**:
   - Younger investors may favor higher-risk investments early on.
   - As you near retirement, shift towards more stable, income-generating assets.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
