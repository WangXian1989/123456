Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions up to any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limit**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50). Contribute accordingly.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you qualify for tax deductions, prioritize traditional IRAs. If not, consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use this account for shorter-term goals since it allows withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Investment Choices**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

### **General Strategy**
1. **Max Out 401(k) Match**: Always start here.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Aim to maximize this if eligible.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: For additional savings or if you need access before retirement.

### **Regular Reassessment**
- **Review Goals**: Align investments with your risk tolerance and retirement goals annually.
- **Diversification**: Ensure asset allocation is diversified across accounts to manage risk effectively.

### **Consult a Professional**
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your individual circumstances. 

This structured approach can optimize tax benefits and growth potential for your retirement savings.
