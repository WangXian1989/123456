Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRA grows tax-free; traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or for assets that generate tax-efficient income (like qualified dividends).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse mix of assets across all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
