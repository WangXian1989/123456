Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - Consider contributing enough to reach the annual limit, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs are good for tax deduction now but taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest any additional funds here for flexibility and access.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Tips**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
   - Reassess your asset allocation regularly based on your age, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
   - Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Balancing these accounts effectively can maximize growth and minimize taxes over the long term.
