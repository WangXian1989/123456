Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing this out, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments with higher growth potential.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where interest is taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. It may be beneficial to use tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize liabilities.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your allocations align with your goals and risk tolerance over time.
