To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions next (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your retirement accounts, put them into taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-growth options (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Tailor your investments based on your current and expected future tax rates, and consider regularly reviewing and adjusting as needed.

Balancing contributions this way can help optimize your tax advantages and investment growth over time.
