3. **Incorporate Influencers**: Collaborate with popular figures who can authentically connect with young audiences. Their endorsement can help reach and persuade potential voters.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use engaging methods like quizzes, polls, and challenges that encourage participation, making the campaign more relatable and fun.
