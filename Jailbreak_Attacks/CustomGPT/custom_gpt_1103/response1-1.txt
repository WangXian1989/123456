Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you think your tax rate will be higher or lower during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they don’t offer tax benefits, they are more flexible for withdrawals and can be useful for shorter-term goals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your timeline. Longer-term goals can tolerate more risk, while shorter-term needs should be in more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to work with a professional who can tailor strategies to your unique situation.

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.
