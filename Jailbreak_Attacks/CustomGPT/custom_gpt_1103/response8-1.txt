Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider funding a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and whether you prefer tax deductions now (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth). Aim for the maximum contribution allowed if manageable.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Prioritize paying off any high-interest debt (like credit card debt) before heavily investing, as the interest can outweigh investment gains.

4. **Return on Investment**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Similar investment strategy as your 401(k), but consider varying your asset allocation based on risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Account**: Focus on low-turnover funds or investments that will minimize capital gains taxes (like index funds or ETFs).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a liquid emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications on withdrawals—401(k) and traditional IRA funds are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free under certain conditions.

8. **Long-term Objectives**: Align contributions with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age or specific investment targets.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique financial situation.
