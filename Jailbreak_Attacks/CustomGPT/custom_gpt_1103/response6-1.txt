Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - Prioritize this contribution before directing funds elsewhere.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) but may offer some flexibility in terms of Roth options (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in cash or liquid assets before investing aggressively.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment duration. Long-term investments might lean more towards growth-oriented assets in tax-advantaged accounts, while more liquid investments might go into taxable accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Plan:
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to the limit or employer match first.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on eligibility and which aligns with your tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds after maxing out retirement accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and market changes.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Invest tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

This strategy helps balance current tax benefits with future needs, while also maintaining flexibility for unexpected expenses.
