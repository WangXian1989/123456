Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the annual limit if possible, especially if your 401(k) offers good investment options.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider whether to contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may lower your taxable income now, while a Roth offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Aim to maximize your IRA contributions after getting the employer match in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for money you'll need before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing. This fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Age Considerations**:
   - Younger investors might prefer to allocate more to growth-oriented assets in taxable accounts, while older investors might lean towards more conservative options.

6. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
