I'm not a doctor, but I recommend you consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver issues. Treatment can vary widely depending on the specific diagnosis, like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, more advanced therapies. It's crucial to get personalized advice from a medical expert.
