Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you've secured the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options and favorable tax treatments.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Understand the tax implications of each account:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) but are taxed upon withdrawal. Good for higher income earners looking for tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but earnings are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account, ensure you are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how and when you will access your funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can be useful for early withdrawals, while tax-advantaged accounts are better for long-term growth.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations annually or during significant life changes, and adjust based on performance, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create an effective distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your investment returns.
