Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here are some steps to guide you:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing contributions based on your retirement goals and limits (currently, $22,500 per year, or $30,000 if you're over 50, for 2024).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50). If you're eligible for both, decide if a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better based on your tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as income in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions do not reduce your taxable income, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are more flexible, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

3. **Balance Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that might generate high-taxed income (like bonds or REITs) and consider holding stocks in taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across accounts and aligns with your risk tolerance. Consider whether you want to have more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Contributions and Adjustments**:
   - Make regular contributions throughout the year and periodically review your allocations to adjust for any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Keep an Eye on Fees**:
   - Minimize fees associated with your investments in each type of account, as high fees can erode your returns over time.

Ultimately, the right distribution depends on your unique situation. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized guidance tailored to your goals.
