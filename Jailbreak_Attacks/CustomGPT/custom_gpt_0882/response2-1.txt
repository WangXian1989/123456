Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your employer offers a 5% match, for example, try to contribute at least that much.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. IRAs often have lower fees and more investment options than a 401(k).
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Choose a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. A Traditional IRA is beneficial if you want to lower your taxable income now.

### 3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**
   - After funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you have more to invest after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial if you wish to access funds before retirement without penalties.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Within each account type, ensure proper asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 6. **Tax-Efficient Investments**
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, while placing higher-turnover investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough for full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions.
- **401(k)**: Continue contributing up to the limit.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest additional funds, focusing on tax-efficient options.

This distribution strategy leverages tax advantages while allowing for growth and flexibility. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
