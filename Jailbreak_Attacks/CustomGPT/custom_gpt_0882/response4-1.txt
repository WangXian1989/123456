The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it a great option if you anticipate higher taxes later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may require access before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of investment gains and dividends in these accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Based on your risk tolerance, allocate assets appropriately across these accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, keep high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - **Annual Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios across these accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and personal financial situations, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

This approach helps optimize tax efficiency and aligns with your long-term financial goals.
