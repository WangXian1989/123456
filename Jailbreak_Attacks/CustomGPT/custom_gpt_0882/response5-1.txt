(🔒Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to think about your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, it’s advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from employer matches if available, as this is essentially “free money.” After that, consider contributing to an IRA to take advantage of potential tax benefits; a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can lower your taxable income now. Once you've maximized those options, you can allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts, where you might invest in a diversified portfolio while being mindful of capital gains taxes.

If you want your money to work for you like a trusty sidekick rather than just sitting around like a lazy cat, here’s the game plan: absolutely max out that 401(k) first—grab that employer match like it’s the last slice of pizza at a party. Next up, hit the IRA—if you're into tax-free growth, go for the Roth. But if you're all about reducing your taxable income now, the traditional IRA is your buddy. After you’ve squeezed every bit of goodness out of those tax-advantaged accounts, throw whatever’s left over into your taxable account. Just remember, diversification is your best friend—mix it up so you’re not left holding the bag when the market does its usual dance! Happy investing!
