To optimize your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, providing tax-free growth.

2. **Asset Location**: Place investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize tax liabilities. Keep lower growth or tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your long-term retirement needs. For taxable accounts, focus on long-term capital gains to minimize taxes. Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains when possible.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Future Taxes**: If you believe youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous.

A tailored approach based on your financial situation, goals, and market conditions is essential. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is also beneficial.
