To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, focus on the IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). IRAs often offer more investment options.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use the 401(k) for tax-deferred growth. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous.

4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to taxable accounts. They provide flexibility but have fewer tax benefits.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified investment strategy across all accounts to balance risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on performance and changing goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your approach further with professional guidance based on your individual financial situation and retirement goals.
