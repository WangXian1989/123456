To effectively allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. If possible, maximize contributions to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes in each account (stocks, bonds, real estate). Maintain the same overall investment strategy across accounts to avoid overlap.

3. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For longer-term goals, like retirement, you can be more aggressive with your investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term goals, keep funds in more liquid and lower-risk assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and adjust as needed based on market performance and changing goals.

6. **Account for Your Tax Situation**:
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

By strategically distributing your investments and regularly reviewing your approach, you can optimize your overall financial growth and tax strategy.
