To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions up to the employer match. If you have high fees in your 401(k), consider contributing only enough to get the match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for longer-term goals or funds you might need before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and goals:
   - Place more volatile assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Consider bonds or more stable investments in taxable accounts due to their tax implications.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and allocation.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Where possible, consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.

Adjust your contributions annually as your financial situation changes to ensure continued alignment with your retirement goals.
