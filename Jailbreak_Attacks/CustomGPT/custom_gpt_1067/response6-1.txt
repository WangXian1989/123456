Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Situation**
   - **Current Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might favor more growth-oriented investments.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Determine how much risk you are willing to take.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, at least contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if eligible based on income limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies before investing heavily.
   - **Debt Reduction**: Pay off high-interest debt as it often yields a higher return than investments.
   - **Allocate by Goals**:
     - **Short-term Goals**: Favor taxable accounts for liquidity.
     - **Retirement Goals**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).

### 4. **Periodic Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Professional**
   - Given the complexity, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

Remember, the specific distribution can vary widely based on individual circumstances, so tailor this strategy to fit your unique financial landscape.
