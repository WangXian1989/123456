Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Determine Your Goals:**
   - Retirement savings
   - Short-term savings
   - Tax efficiency

### 2. **Consider Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; employer matching can be beneficial.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax advantages; Roth grows tax-free, while traditional allows for tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals; subject to capital gains tax.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Higher contributions to tax-advantaged accounts can save on current taxes.
   - Consider current and anticipated future tax brackets.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks) due to tax deferral/tax-free growth.
   - Hold more income-generating assets (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

### 5. **Contribution Strategy:**
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - Next, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
   - Fund taxable accounts with excess savings.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Adjust allocations based on market conditions, retirement timeline, and financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice based on your unique financial situation is invaluable.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): 10-15% of pre-tax income until matched.
- IRA: Max out contributions ($6,500 for the year, or $7,500 if over 50, as of 2023).
- Taxable Accounts: Fund with remaining savings to maintain liquidity.

### Conclusion:
Achieving a balanced approach between tax-deferred growth and liquidity will enhance your overall financial strategy. Regularly reassess your situation to ensure it aligns with evolving goals and market conditions.
