Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough to Get the Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Prioritize Roth IRAs (if applicable)**
   - **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you qualify based on income limits, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Traditional IRA Contributions**
   - **Fund a Traditional IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA. This can provide tax-deferred growth, helping to reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute.

### 4. **Fund the 401(k) up to the Annual Limit**
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing employer contributions and IRA contributions, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions until you reach the annual limit.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility and Short-term Goals**
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need before retirement, or for specific savings goals. This offers more liquidity and flexibility compared to retirement accounts.

### 6. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Consider Capital Gains and Dividends**: Be mindful of how investment choices in taxable accounts can lead to capital gains taxes. Aim for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Review and Readjust Your Allocation**: Regularly revisit your investment strategy and make adjustments based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Personalized Strategy**: Depending on your unique financial situation, a financial advisor can help create a tailored strategy that aligns with your goals.

### Summary:
- **Maximize 401(k) match** → **Contribute to Roth/Traditional IRA** → **Increase 401(k)** → **Utilize taxable accounts** → **Regularly assess and rebalance**.

Make sure to tailor these suggestions according to your specific financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals.
