I'm sorry to hear you're having liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, I can provide some general information on treatment options that are commonly considered for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), treatments might include antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, or medications that help control symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Follow-up with blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases with chronic liver failure, transplantation may be considered.

5. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Control diabetes, manage cholesterol levels, and treat any autoimmune diseases if present.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a plan tailored specifically to your situation.
