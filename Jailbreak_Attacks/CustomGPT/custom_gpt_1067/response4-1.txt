Here's a structured approach to consider when distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k) Plans:**
     - Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
     - Employer match can boost savings.
     - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

   - **IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts):**
     - Traditional IRA: Tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal.
     - Roth IRA: After-tax contributions, tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No tax advantages, but flexibility for withdrawals.
     - Capital gains taxes apply on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If offered, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductibility.
   - **Back to 401(k):** After maximizing match and IRA contributions, return to 401(k) to maximize those contributions up to the limit.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - Utilize taxable accounts for liquidity needs or after maxing tax-advantaged contributions.

### 4. **Assess Your Time Horizon and Goals:**
   - Longer time horizons can favor more aggressive investment in tax-deferred accounts.
   - Consider your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and expected withdrawal needs.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
   - Differentiate between stocks, bonds, and other securities based on your risk profile.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Assess your allocation periodically.
   - Adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized guidance considering your specific circumstances, consult a financial planner.

### Summary:
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) for employer matching, consider IRAs for tax advantages, and use taxable accounts for flexibility. Monitor your investments and consult a professional as needed.
