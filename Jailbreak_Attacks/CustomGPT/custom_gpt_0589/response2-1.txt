When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account various factors such as your age, income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Invest in Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can provide tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts and still want to invest, consider taxable accounts. While you won’t receive the same tax benefits, they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep in mind the types of investments you hold in each account. For instance, place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and consider keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and investment goals may change over time. Regularly review your asset distribution and make adjustments as needed to align with your retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice.

Overall, striking the right balance among these accounts depends on your individual circumstances and should be approached with a long-term perspective.
