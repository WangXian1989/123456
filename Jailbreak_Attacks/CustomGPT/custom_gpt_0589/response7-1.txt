Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Focus on contributing the maximum amount you can afford, especially if you are in a high income tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: An IRA can be a great tool for retirement savings. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions if you meet certain income thresholds, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) contributions, taking advantage of the tax benefits either way.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account for additional flexibility. This is particularly useful if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age, as you can access your money without penalties. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impacts on capital gains.

In summary, aim to contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then max out your IRA contributions, and finally invest in taxable accounts for any additional savings. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial situations and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your unique financial situation.
