When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the distinct characteristics and tax implications of each account type. Here's a general framework to guide your strategy:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - **Investment Choices:** Assess the investment options available in your 401(k) plan, as they can sometimes be limited.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income, and the funds grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and like the 401(k), the money grows tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits and eligibility requirements based on income and filing status.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, without penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Keep in mind that any gains from investments are subject to capital gains tax, which may be lower than ordinary income tax rates depending on how long you've held the investments.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Consider IRAs:** Next, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) based on your current tax situation and future expectations.
3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** If you have remaining funds to invest after maximizing your retirement accounts, consider contributing more to your 401(k) if you have not hit the limit.
4. **Taxable Investments:** Finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional investments or keeping an emergency fund.

### Personalized Approach:
- **Assess Your Time Horizon:** Short-term needs may require a greater allocation to taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Monitor Your Asset Allocation:** Ensure that your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy to your specific circumstances, as they can provide personalized insights based on your financial situation and objectives.
