To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: A retirement account sponsored by an employer allowing pre-tax or after-tax contributions (depending on the plan). Contributions may reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: An individual retirement account that can be traditional (pre-tax contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments that are not placed in a retirement account and where you pay taxes on earnings and capital gains each year.

2. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**:
   - Short-term vs. long-term needs: If you need access to funds in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts as they offer liquidity without penalties for withdrawal.
   - Retirement timeline: If you're far from retirement, you might want to maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.

3. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out this account if you're in a higher tax bracket, as it offers good tax deferral advantages.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Ensure you don't overly concentrate your assets in one area.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain the desired allocation across accounts, especially after significant market movements.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - To tailor your approach based on your individual financial situation, market conditions, and tax implications, consider getting professional advice.

By understanding each account's unique features, assessing your personal financial goals, and strategically distributing your funds, you can make informed decisions that optimize your investment returns and tax advantages.
