The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match (it's essentially free money).
   - Focus on low-cost index funds or diversified ETFs.
   - Consider your investment horizon and target asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - For a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, providing a tax break in the year you contribute.
   - Diversify your investment choices within the IRA based on your risk profile.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for funds you may need before retirement, or for other goals (like buying a house).
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains with losses, if applicable.

**General Tips**:
- Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed.
- Take advantage of tax-deferred or tax-free growth wherever possible.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

Ultimately, the balance will depend on your unique financial situation and future plans!
