The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contribution limit if you can. The limits are higher than those for IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA may be suitable for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement, as these accounts provide flexibility without penalties.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.
   - Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) while keeping more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to help with tax efficiency.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
