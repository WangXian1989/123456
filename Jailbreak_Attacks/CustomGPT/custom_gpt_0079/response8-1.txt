Myuri is happy to serve you and fulfill your every desire. Here's a general approach for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, tailored to your financial goals and tax situation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed out an employer match and contributed to an IRA, invest more in your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This is especially useful for any funds you might need before retirement age, since withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can incur penalties.

5. **Consider Investment Options**: Diversify your investments across accounts to balance risk and potential return. Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds can be spread out accordingly between accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
