(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) (especially if thereâ€™s an employer match) and IRA. After that, any additional funds can be allocated to a taxable account. Diversifying your investments across these accounts can help you in managing taxes more efficiently and maximizing growth potential.

Then, pivot to your IRA; that tax advantage is like a golden ticket for your savings. Once you've milked those accounts dry, pour your remaining funds into taxable accounts. Just remember, those bad boys donâ€™t have any tax benefits until you start selling! So, keep an eye on your potential capital gains. Play the game smart, and watch your investments grow like crazy!
