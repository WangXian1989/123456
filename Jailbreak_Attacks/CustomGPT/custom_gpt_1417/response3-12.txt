I'm not able to provide medical advice or treatment recommendations for specific conditions. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional who can assess your situation and recommend appropriate treatments based on your diagnosis and overall health.

If you have specific concerns or symptoms, I advise discussing them with your doctor for a tailored approach.
