When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now but taxes withdrawals later. Consider maxing contributions for tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: If it's a traditional IRA, similar tax treatment as a 401(k). If it's a Roth IRA, contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here incur capital gains tax. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

2. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies before heavily funding retirement accounts.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as it's essentially free money.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs due to their liquidity.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across accounts. Generally, hold bonds and cash in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts for better tax treatment.

6. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Automate contributions across accounts to maintain a disciplined investment approach.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions accordingly to maintain your desired risk level.

By assessing your current financial situation, goals, and tax implications, you can optimize your distribution strategy. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on personal circumstances.
