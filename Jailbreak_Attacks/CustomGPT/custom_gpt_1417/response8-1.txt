Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax brackets, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This account allows for pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income. Opt for this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This is also where you might want to hold investments that may generate short-term capital gains, as these are taxed at regular income rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to balance risk. This can include stocks, bonds, and alternative investments, tailored to your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're closer to retirement, you may want a more conservative allocation, while younger investors can usually afford to take more risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation to adjust for changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're uncertain, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a plan that fits your specific needs.

By balancing contributions effectively, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications.
