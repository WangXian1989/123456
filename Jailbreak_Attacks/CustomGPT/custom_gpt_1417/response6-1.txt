To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale and may incur taxes on dividends and interest.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your employer match, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA, especially if itâ€™s Roth, for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments after maximizing retirement accounts.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments with higher growth potential (e.g., stocks).
   - **Income Generation:** Utilize taxable accounts for income-producing investments (e.g., bonds, dividend-paying stocks) to manage taxes more effectively.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor asset allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired risk profile, adjusting for market conditions and life changes.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can optimize your strategy based on specific financial goals and circumstances.

By assessing your goals, understanding tax implications, and strategically prioritizing contributions, you can create a well-balanced investment strategy.
