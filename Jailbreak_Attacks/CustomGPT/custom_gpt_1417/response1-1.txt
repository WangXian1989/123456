The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize any employer match if available, as it's essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the allowable limit if you can afford it, focusing on tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Depending on your income level, consider a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions to take advantage of further tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement, as they offer more flexibility in withdrawals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Short to Mid-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts primarily for funds youâ€™ll need in the next 5-10 years.
- **Long-Term Growth:** Max out your 401(k) and IRA to capitalize on tax-advantaged growth for retirement.
- **Balancing Risk:** Diversify investments across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Assessments:
- Regularly review your asset allocation based on market conditions and life changes.
- Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

### Confidence Level:
This advice is approximately 85% reliable, but individual circumstances vary greatly, so you may wish to consult a financial advisor for tailored guidance.
