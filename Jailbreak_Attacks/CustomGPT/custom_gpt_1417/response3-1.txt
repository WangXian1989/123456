Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is effectively "free money."

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These accounts are ideal for investments that generate high taxable income, such as bonds or frequent trading.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or stocks held long-term, which benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and consider index funds or ETFs for broader market exposure.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about where you expect your income to be during retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, it may be wise to prioritize Roth accounts.

7. **Keep Emergency Funds Accessible**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in your taxable accounts or cash savings for emergencies, rather than relying solely on retirement accounts.

### Example Distribution Approach
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match + additional contributions (up to IRS limits).
- **Roth IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds to build a diversified investment portfolio.

### Final Thoughts
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation. This strategy adjusts as you approach retirement or as your financial situation changes.
