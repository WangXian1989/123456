Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. The choice between the two depends on your current and expected future tax situation.
   
2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain criteria.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains taxes apply here, so be mindful of how often you buy and sell investments. Prefer long-term holdings to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified. This can help reduce risk and improve returns over time.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals carefully in retirement to minimize taxes. It may be beneficial to tap taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, or retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure how to allocate your resources effectively, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can cater to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is personalized, so tailor these general guidelines to fit your circumstances and objectives.
