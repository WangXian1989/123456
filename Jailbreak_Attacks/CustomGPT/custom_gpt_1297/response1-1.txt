To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, such as a traditional 401(k) or IRA. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth accounts) until withdrawal.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Assess your current and expected future tax brackets. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket, consider contributing to a Roth IRA.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ideally, you should aim for a balance across these accounts to leverage the unique tax benefits of each:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match and consider maxing it out if possible.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions to either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maxed out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional growth, keeping in mind the tax implications of short-term vs. long-term capital gains.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for how you will withdraw money in retirement. Typically, you'd want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to manage your tax burden effectively.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Regularly review your investments and contributions based on changing financial situations, market conditions, and life events.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your individual circumstances and financial goals.
