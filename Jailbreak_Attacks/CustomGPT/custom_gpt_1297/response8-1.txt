It's generally wise to approach the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts with a balanced strategy that considers factors such as tax implications, your retirement goals, and your current financial situation. Here’s a strategic breakdown:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here, especially if there is a matching contribution. Consider maxing out if possible.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): If you've maxed out your 401(k) or you have a low-income year allowing for a Roth IRA contribution, put your next dollars here. Remember, contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, or if you need more liquidity, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals, but be mindful of taxes on capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that each account type is well-diversified. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket; consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) across your accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., stocks that produce qualified dividends) and less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement. Rebalancing may be necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to fit your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

It's crucial to understand your individual situation and consult with a financial advisor to optimize your investment strategy.
