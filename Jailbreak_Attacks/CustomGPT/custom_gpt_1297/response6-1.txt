Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on multiple factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, also contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Balance for Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged contributions, consider using taxable accounts for investments that may afford liquidity without penalties for withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on these accounts for investments that generate high tax burdens (e.g., bonds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for growth-focused investments which benefit from lower capital gains taxes for long-term holdings.

4. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation periodically and adjust contributions based on performance and your evolving financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation and help optimize your investment distribution.
