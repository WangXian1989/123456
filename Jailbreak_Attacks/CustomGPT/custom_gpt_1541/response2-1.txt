When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax breaks that can enhance your investment growth. For a 401(k), especially if your employer matches contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the maximum contribution for 401(k)s is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Diversify Investments**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This means balancing equities, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts provide no tax benefits, so consider holding investments that generate little income (like growth stocks) there to minimize taxes. Use tax-advantaged accounts for income-producing investments to defer taxes.

5. **Account for Withdrawal Needs**: If you expect to need funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts since withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur taxes and penalties if taken early.

6. **Adjust for Personal Circumstances**: Each person's situation varies. Consider factors like your age, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial picture when deciding your allocation.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investment strategy and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting contributions as your financial situation changes.

Consulting a financial adviser can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial goals and circumstances.
