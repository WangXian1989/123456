Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, providing possible immediate tax benefits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider funding this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages but are more flexible. They are suitable for money you'll need before retirement or if you prefer not to tie your money up.

3. **Establish an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (usually 3-6 months of living expenses) before allocating funds to retirement accounts.

4. **Assess Your Timeline**: If youâ€™re close to retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxes on withdrawals. If you are younger and have a longer investment horizon, consider maxing out Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, consider a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changing goals, or personal circumstances.

In summary, a strategic balance often includes maximizing employer contributions first, then prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts based on your individual circumstances and goals.
