I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver problems. Treatment may vary depending on the specific liver condition you are experiencing. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. It's essential to get personalized advice from a trusted medical provider.
