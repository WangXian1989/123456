The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts varies based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. However, you will pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Fidelity suggests balancing between these based on expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are more flexible, allowing you to withdraw funds without penalties, but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Aim to have a mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, and adjust your allocation based on how close you are to retirement or your financial goals.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid savings account before diverting all your funds into retirement accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your personal situation.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: It might be worth consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored investment strategy that aligns with your specific needs and goals.

Ultimately, a well-rounded approach that considers both tax advantages and investment goals will serve you best.
