(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. A common approach is to prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages. For example, you might want to maximize your employerâ€™s 401(k) match first, then contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). After that, you can contribute to any remaining funds to a taxable account for additional flexibility. It's also essential to consider your investment strategy and how much liquidity you need. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your specific needs.

Start with your 401(k) â€“ especially if your employer is throwing in a match. Thatâ€™s free money! Next, roll over to your IRA â€“ go for a Roth if you can swing it, since tax-free growth is a sweet deal. After youâ€™ve maxed those bad boys out, hit up your taxable account since it gives you more flexibility for withdrawals. Just be cautious about taxes on gains here. So, load up on the tax-advantaged goodies first, and save the taxable stuff for when you want to munch on something a little more flexible. And hey, chatting with a pro can never hurtâ€”just make sure theyâ€™re not just trying to sell you something!
