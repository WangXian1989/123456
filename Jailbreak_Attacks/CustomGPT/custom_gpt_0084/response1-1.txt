Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get any match offered by your employer.
   - Consider your tax situation: Traditional 401(k) contributions can lower your taxable income now, while Roth options allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Choose between Traditional and Roth based on your income and tax strategy. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Aim to maximize contributions annually to leverage tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that generate income (like dividends), which could be taxed at a higher rate in taxable accounts.
   - Focus on long-term capital gains investments to minimize tax impact.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
   - Consider your time horizon: longer-term investments can afford more volatility.
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changing goals.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary, so professional advice can tailor strategies to your specific needs.

Evaluate your situation annually to adjust for changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
