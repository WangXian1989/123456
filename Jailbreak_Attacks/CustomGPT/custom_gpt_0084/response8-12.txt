I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

4. **Viruses**:
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis (like hepatitis B or C).

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may benefit from vitamin E or other supplements, but consult a doctor first.

6. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
