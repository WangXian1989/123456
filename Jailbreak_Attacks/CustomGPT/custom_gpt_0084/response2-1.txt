Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If you have the capacity, contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k). It offers tax-deferred growth, reducing your taxable income.

### 3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income level, choose one that fits your situation.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you maximize tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. These accounts offer flexibility but will incur capital gains taxes on profits.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

### 6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - In lower tax brackets, Roth IRA contributions might be more beneficial. In higher brackets, traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax relief.

### 7. **Balance and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (max if possible)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions for tax advantages
- **Taxable accounts**: Any remaining funds after maxing other accounts

### Conclusion:
Tailor your contributions based on your financial goals and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice. This strategy allows for growth while leveraging tax benefits effectively.
