To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. The contribution limit is typically lower than a 401(k), but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing the Roth IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This reduces your taxable income now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts. These allow for more flexible access to your money and can be useful for shorter-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, more aggressive investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments (like bonds) can go in taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-inefficient assets (like bonds and high-yield investments) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
