Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full amount. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Ideal for higher earners.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible, but distributions in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in easily accessible accounts before investing heavily.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for funds you may need before retirement. They offer flexibility but donâ€™t have the same tax advantages.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, diversify your investments across different accounts. For example, consider holding more bonds in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications since bond income is taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
