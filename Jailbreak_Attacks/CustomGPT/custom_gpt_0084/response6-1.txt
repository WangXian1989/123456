To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Tax advantages for retirement savings, with potential tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices but subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **Fund IRA Next**: Take advantage of tax benefits (Roth vs. Traditional).
   - **Allocate Funds to Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for any additional investments.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Use taxable accounts to offset gains by selling underperforming assets.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your financial goals.
