Investing strategies vary based on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Select a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your age and risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; traditional IRAs may be beneficial for current tax reductions.
   - **Broad Diversification**: Invest in low-cost index funds or ETFs throughout your IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for investments that may get taxed favorably (like long-term capital gains).
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some cash or liquid assets in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies first.
- **Balanced Approach**: Aim for a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations and adjust as necessary based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies is always recommended!
