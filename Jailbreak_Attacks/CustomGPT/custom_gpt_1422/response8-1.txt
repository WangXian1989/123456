When considering how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach that might be helpful:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k):**  
   If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:**  
   Once you've taken full advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now with taxes owed during retirement.

3. **Fund the 401(k) Further:**  
   After contributing to an IRA, you might want to go back and increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if it has good investment options and low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**  
   If you have additional funds after maximizing your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility for accessing your funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments:**  
   Within each account type, ensure that you have a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance. This typically includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Tax Considerations:**  
   Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. Generally, it's beneficial to hold more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient investments (such as index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

7. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly:**  
   Your financial situation, goals, and market conditions can change. Regularly reviewing your asset allocation and making adjustments will help ensure you're on track.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
