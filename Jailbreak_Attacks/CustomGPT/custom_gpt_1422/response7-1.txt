To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. A Roth IRA, in particular, allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Diversification:** Aim for a balanced approach between tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free accounts (Roth IRA). This will provide flexibility in retirement when it comes to tax planning.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:** Taxable accounts can be beneficial for immediate access and capital gains treatment on long-term investments. Focus on holding investments that create lower tax burdens (like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs) in these accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit most from tax deferral or exemption.

6. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
