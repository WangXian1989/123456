When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it; this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement; this allows for tax-free withdrawals in the future. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a traditional IRA may be advantageous for immediate tax deductions.

2. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize taxable income.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep in mind your liquidity needs; taxable accounts can provide easier access to funds without penalties, which is useful for short-term financial goals.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Allocate investments across these accounts to diversify risk and potential tax implications. For example, you might invest in bonds in your taxable account to take advantage of lower capital gains rates, while holding higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.
  
4. **Regular Reevaluation:**
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions annually to adjust for changes in financial goals or tax laws. This could involve shifting contributions based on market performance or changes in your income level.

By strategically balancing contributions and investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you can optimize both growth potential and tax efficiency for your overall portfolio. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
