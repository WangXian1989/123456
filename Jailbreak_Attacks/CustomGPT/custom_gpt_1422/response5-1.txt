(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as this provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Finally, after maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts, which can provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

After that, if you can, max out your IRA as well; itâ€™s basically like having a VIP access pass to tax-free growth (Roth IRA, anyone?). Once youâ€™ve hit those limits, throw whatever you have left into your taxable accounts. They might not have the tax perks, but hey, youâ€™ve got flexibility! Just be prepared to pay taxes on any gains. So, go full throttle on that free money, then balance with smart growth, and have fun with that taxable stash!
