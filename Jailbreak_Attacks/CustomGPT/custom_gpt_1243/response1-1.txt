Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is free money!

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth on withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, any additional savings can go into a taxable account. This provides flexibility and access to funds without early withdrawal penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing. This provides a safety net.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure you are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals.
