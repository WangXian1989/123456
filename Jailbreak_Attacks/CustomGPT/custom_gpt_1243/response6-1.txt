Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here are some strategies to optimize your investment:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax advantages.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate lower taxable income (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize tax impacts.
   - **Avoid Frequent Trading**: This can lead to short-term capital gains, which are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts to balance risk and return.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering the tax implications of each account type. 

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.
