Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, so these may be better suited for shorter-term goals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before maximizing retirement accounts.

4. **Diverse Investments**: Consider your risk tolerance and age. Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement may prefer more conservative options.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice considering your individual financial situation, consulting a professional may be beneficial.

This approach will help you maximize your investments while planning for both short-term needs and long-term retirement goals.
