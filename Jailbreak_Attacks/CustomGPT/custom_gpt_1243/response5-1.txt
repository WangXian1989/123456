I'm not a financial advisor, but I can offer some general strategies! 

A common approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get that match, as it's essentially "free money."
   
2. **Fund Your IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Choose a Roth or traditional IRA based on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've optimized your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These can be flexible for short-term goals and donâ€™t have the same penalties for withdrawal as retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Keep more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy based on your specific situation and goals!
