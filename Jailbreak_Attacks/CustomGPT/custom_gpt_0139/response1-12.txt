I’m not a doctor, but I can suggest that it’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Typical treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through blood tests and imaging.
4. **Surgery or procedures**: In some cases, procedures like liver biopsies or even transplants may be necessary.

Always get professional guidance to develop a plan tailored to your specific situation.
