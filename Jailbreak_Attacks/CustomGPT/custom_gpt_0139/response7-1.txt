Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)), which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider your current tax rate. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits and eligibility for deductions based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide easy access to funds, but you will face capital gains taxes on earnings.
   - **Investment Choices**: You can invest in any asset class, but consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in an easily accessible account.
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Fill your 401(k) and IRA to the max before putting more into taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
It’s beneficial to seek personalized advice based on your unique financial situation to optimize your investment strategy.
