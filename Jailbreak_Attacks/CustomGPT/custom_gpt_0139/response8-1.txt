To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match, then focus on your IRA.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a liquid account before maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. These can include stocks, bonds, or ETFs focusing on long-term growth or dividends.

5. **Withdrawal Considerations**: Think about how and when you'll need to access funds. Taxable accounts may be better for short-term needs, while retirement accounts are designed for long-term growth.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors can afford a more aggressive portfolio in retirement accounts.

7. **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
