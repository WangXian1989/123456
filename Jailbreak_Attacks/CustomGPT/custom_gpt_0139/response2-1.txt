Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your savings and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement strategy. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing the IRA, go back to your 401(k) and try to reach the maximum contribution limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed in the short to medium term or for assets that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Place more conservative assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Adjust contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, favor traditional accounts; if you expect to remain in a higher bracket, consider Roth accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your investment strategy annually and adjust contributions and allocations based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in income.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Up to the match, then consider maxing out annually.
- **IRA**: Full annual contribution.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings beyond retirement accounts.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals.
