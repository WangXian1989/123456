I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet and regular exercise can significantly improve liver health. Avoid alcohol and limit fatty foods.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications or other treatments.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
