Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing the maximum limit, especially if you have a high income and may benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts once you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts. Utilize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can mitigate risk and improve returns.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes in retirement, often involving a combination of withdrawals from these accounts based on your tax bracket.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances.
