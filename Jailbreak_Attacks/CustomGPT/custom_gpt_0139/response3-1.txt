Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deferral.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**:
   - Before heavily investing, consider paying off high-interest debt, which can provide a better return.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These offer flexibility, but be mindful of tax implications on gains.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk, considering your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consult a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money while aiming for growth and tax efficiency.
