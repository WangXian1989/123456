To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. It's great for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they're realized, which can be less advantageous for long-term growth.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) before allocating significant amounts to taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and aim to maximize these.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

7. **Consider Withdrawals Timing**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement; using tax-advantaged accounts first can minimize tax liabilities.

Each individual's situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
