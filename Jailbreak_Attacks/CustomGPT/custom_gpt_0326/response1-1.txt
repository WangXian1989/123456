Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level and tax bracket.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the match, increase contributions to your 401(k), especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

4. **Build Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. This can include stocks, bonds, or ETFs.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) and place higher-tax investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually to adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
