Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then consider maximizing contributions. This account offers tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts can help you manage taxes since you may have more control over capital gains. Keep investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - For long-term goals, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term needs, use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, tailoring the asset allocation based on time horizon and risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals.

Diversifying across these account types can help optimize growth while managing tax implications. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
