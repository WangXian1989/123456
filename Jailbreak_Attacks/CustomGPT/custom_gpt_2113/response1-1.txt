Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved in a liquid account before investing.

2. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Use this for long-term growth, focusing on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

3. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals, so consider investing in a diversified portfolio.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. 

5. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diverse your investments across all accounts based on your total portfolio, not just individual accounts. 

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific needs.
