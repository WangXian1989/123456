To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Start with 401(k) Contributions**: If you can, contribute up to the annual limit in your 401(k), as it offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Utilize IRAs**: After maxing out your 401(k) employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term gains or for cash that you may need access to before retirement. This allows for more flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Tax-Efficient Investments**: In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Plan withdrawals based on your expected income during retirement; this will help manage your tax liabilities.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances and goals.
