Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Typically offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Provides tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax, but offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment types.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) up to the employer match to take full advantage of free money. Then, max out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility).
   - **Order of Contributions**: 
     1. **401(k) (up to the match)**
     2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
     3. **401(k) (beyond the match)**
     4. **Taxable Accounts**

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax-Deductible Contributions**: If you’re in a high tax bracket, traditional IRAs and 401(k)s may provide immediate tax breaks.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: For Roth accounts, consider your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Capital Gains**: Manage your taxable account strategically to minimize short-term capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually has limited investment options. Choose diversified funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Offers more investment flexibility. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.
   - **Taxable Account**: Use for investments that yield lower tax burdens (e.g., index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains.

### 5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, keep more in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations periodically (annually or semi-annually), adjusting to meet your changing financial situation or goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized plan tailored to your unique circumstances can optimize your strategy.

By focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first and understanding the specific benefits of each account type, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your investments.
