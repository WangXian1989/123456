Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you strategize:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Higher Contribution Limits**: 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits than IRAs. Once you've reached the employer match, assess whether to continue contributing to your 401(k) or to focus on your IRA.

3. **Tax Diversification:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These accounts can offer tax-deferred growth. Traditional accounts lower your taxable income now but taxes come due later. Roth accounts allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible and offer no contribution limits. They can be beneficial for goals outside of retirement since you can access funds without penalties. 

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options. Consider a mix of stock funds and bonds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **IRA**: Generally offers a broader range of investment choices. You might want to hold riskier assets here for potential higher growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments where you want more control over withdrawals or for holding assets that generate lower tax burdens (like index funds or tax-efficient funds).

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets. In high-income years, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts might make sense, while in lower-income years, Roth contributions could be more beneficial.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering at least 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.
