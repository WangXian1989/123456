When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to maximize this benefit.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term and long-term financial goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals, while retirement accounts can focus on long-term growth.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance in each account. Generally, you may want to take more risks in tax-deferred accounts since the tax implications won't impact your immediate returns.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawal strategies based on the tax implications of each account type. In retirement, consider when to take distributions from each account to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Ensure you're making the most of tax-advantaged accounts before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

A common approach is to max out contributions to your 401(k) (especially if there's a match), then contribute to an IRA, splitting between traditional and Roth based on your tax situation, and finally allocate any surplus funds into taxable accounts.
