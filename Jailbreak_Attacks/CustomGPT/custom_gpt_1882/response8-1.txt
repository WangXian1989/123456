Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some guidelines to help you optimize your distribution:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your IRA contributions next, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After these accounts, invest in taxable accounts, particularly if you have a long-term investment horizon.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA): Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep in mind capital gains taxes when selling investments. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of investments offered in your plan, considering factors like risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: You have more flexibility in asset choice, so consider diversifying further, perhaps with individual stocks, ETFs, or other investment vehicles.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals by periodically rebalancing your portfolio across all accounts.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If you are closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards safer assets. Conversely, if you have a longer time horizon, you might afford to take more risks.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, including income, expenses, and retirement goals.

By focusing on these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
