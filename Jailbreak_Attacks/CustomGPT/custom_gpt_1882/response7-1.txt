Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Assess Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), contributions might be tax-deductible (Traditional) or you may pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax benefits at contribution, but they offer flexibility. You pay capital gains tax on earnings when realized.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Note the contribution limits for each account type and maximize contributions where feasible.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to manage risk and balance growth over time.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund before heavily investing; ensure you have enough liquidity.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations according to your goals and market changes.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances.

By following these principles, you can optimize the benefits of each account while aligning them with your overall financial strategy.
