To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, as it lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide a tax deduction, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Keep in mind tax implications when planning withdrawals in retirement. Typically, you would withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your contributions, you can optimize tax efficiency and align with your long-term financial goals.
