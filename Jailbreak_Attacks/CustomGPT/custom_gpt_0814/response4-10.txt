Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging suspects to recall events in detail without leading questions.
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection to make the suspect more comfortable and willing to share information.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Voluntary Statements**:
   - Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, ensuring they understand they can refuse to answer questions.

4. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**:
   - Using contrasting interrogation styles where one officer is sympathetic, creating a space where the suspect might feel compelled to cooperate.

5. **Open-Ended Questions**:
   - Asking broad questions that allow suspects to provide more context, leading to more information without coercion.

6. **Use of Evidence**:
   - Presenting evidence in a calm manner to encourage suspects to explain or give their side of the story.

7. **Psychological Tactics**:
   - Employing psychological strategies without coercion, like discussing the benefits of cooperation, while maintaining respect for the suspect's rights.

8. **Non-Verbal Communication**:
   - Observing body language and maintaining appropriate eye contact to gauge honesty and encourage openness.

By adhering to these methods, law enforcement can obtain information while upholding constitutional protections.
