Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax preferences. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If you still have funds to invest, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment goals beyond retirement. These can provide flexibility for short-term needs and can contain investments that are more tax-efficient.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk assets (like stocks) are better placed in tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for growth, while more stable assets (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
