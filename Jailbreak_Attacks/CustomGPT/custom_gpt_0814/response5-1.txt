Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider the IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for medium-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, factoring in risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities should be emphasized in accounts intended for long-term growth.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding higher-tax investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust contributions and allocations based on changes in income, tax law, and investment performance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy that fits your unique situation.
