Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Once youâ€™re contributing to your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are useful for short-term goals and can provide liquidity. However, they are subject to capital gains taxes. It's often recommended to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify:** Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically adjust your allocations to keep your investment strategy aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Align your investment strategy with your long-term goals (retirement age, lifestyle expectations, etc.). 

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're uncertain, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your needs and situation.

In summary, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider your overall tax situation, diversify your investments, and keep an eye on your long-term goals.
