Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made after-tax, meaning qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Use this account for investments you'll need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Focus on long-term growth through diversified investments in stocks, bonds, and funds that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before fully investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses, typically kept in liquid, low-risk savings accounts.

### Regular Review
- Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

### Personal Considerations
- Factors like your age, risk tolerance, time horizon, and current financial situation should also heavily influence your strategy.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice for your specific situation.
