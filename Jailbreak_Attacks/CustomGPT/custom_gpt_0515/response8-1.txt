Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income, consider making contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are advantageous for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to contribute more, particularly if you're in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have extra funds, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and may also provide favorable capital gains tax rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across each account based on your risk tolerance, ensuring a balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
