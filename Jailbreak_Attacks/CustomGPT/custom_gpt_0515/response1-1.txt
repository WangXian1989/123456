Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now. Ideal for long-term savings, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No upfront tax benefits but offer flexibility for withdrawals. Capital gains are taxed when realized, not when earned.

### 3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for tax-deferred growth. If your employer offers a range of investment options, diversify within the account.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you're expecting higher future income, this might be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

### 4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors may lean more towards aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while older investors might prioritize capital preservation.

### 5. **Periodic Rebalancing**:
   - Regardless of your initial distribution, periodically reassess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

### Final Notes:
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances. Consider factors like investment fees, risk tolerance, and market conditions when making decisions.
