Investing and distributing money across various account types—401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

2. **Prioritize IRAs**: After qualifying for the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you’re maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, you can then allocate funds to a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties (though you'll incur taxes on gains).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider holding growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (where gains are shielded from immediate taxes) and income-generating assets in taxable accounts (where you may prefer to defer tax).

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
