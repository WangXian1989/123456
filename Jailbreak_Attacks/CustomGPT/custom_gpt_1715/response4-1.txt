The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions typically lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals later. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, meaning your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Emergency Fund Prioritization**: Before allocating significant funds to retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses) in a liquid, easily accessible account.

4. **Diversify Investment Types**: Within each account, balance between stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance. Consider putting higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize their growth potential.

5. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**: Your current tax bracket can guide your decisions. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type (e.g., as of 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500, and for IRAs, it's $6,500). Allocate funds accordingly to stay within these limits.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts may provide more flexibility for early withdrawals without penalties, whereas retirement accounts typically come with restrictions.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Life changes and market fluctuations can affect your allocation. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your investments according to your goals will help in maintaining the right balance.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation and to stay updated with tax laws and investment opportunities.
