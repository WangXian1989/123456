I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for specific medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary greatly depending on the underlying condition, severity, and overall health. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or complications, and in some cases, liver transplant. Again, please reach out to a qualified healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.
