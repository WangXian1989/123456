I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional who can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment options for liver issues. Common approaches might involve lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, medical procedures. Please seek the guidance of a medical practitioner for personalized advice.
