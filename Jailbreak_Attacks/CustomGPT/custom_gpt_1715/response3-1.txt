When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) until you reach the employer match. If possible, continue contributing beyond the match, especially if your tax situation favors traditional contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawals from your 401(k) (traditional and Roth) and IRA in retirement. Traditional accounts may have tax consequences on withdrawals, while Roth accounts typically do not.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals, and you'll want to consider capital gains taxes when investing in these accounts.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: 
   - If you are many years away from retirement, you can afford to take more risks in your investments. However, as you approach retirement, it may be wise to shift towards more conservative investments within your retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your investments periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help create an investment strategy tailored to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your current financial status, investment goals, and retirement plans. Balancing your contributions across these accounts can help you optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
