Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** 
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions:** Both are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions may reduce your taxable income (traditional accounts), and gains can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for better tax rates.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have liquid assets (in a savings account) before heavily investing in retirement accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals if unforeseen expenses arise.

4. **Diversity in Investment Vehicles:**
   - Allocate funds across these accounts based on investment goals. 
   - For long-term growth, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts; for short-term needs or flexibility, consider taxable accounts.

5. **Adjustment Based on Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger individuals might prefer more aggressive investment strategies in tax-deferred accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute at least up to the employer match; then assess further contributions based on tax bracket and retirement timeline.
- **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify and expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you might need access to before retirement or for investments that yield favorable tax treatment.

By analyzing your financial situation and adjusting based on these principles, you can create a balanced approach to distribution that aligns with your goals.
