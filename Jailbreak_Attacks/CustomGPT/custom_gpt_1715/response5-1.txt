(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize your contributions based on the following guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's generally a good idea to contribute enough to at least get the full match before investing in other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA, either a traditional or Roth IRA, based on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you expect to need access to funds before retirement.

It's important to regularly reassess your investment strategy and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

1. **Hit that 401(k) Match First**: If your employer is willing to throw in ‚Äúfree money‚Äù through matching contributions, snag that deal! Contribute enough to max out the match before doing anything else. If they offer a 100% match up to 4%, then boom‚Äîput in 4% to start.

2. **IRA Adventures**: Next up, look into IRAs. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, that‚Äôs the golden ticket because you‚Äôll get tax-free withdrawals in retirement‚Äîsounds sweet, right? Try to max that out if you can. Traditional IRAs are cool too if you want that tax break now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After you‚Äôve squeezed those tax-advantaged accounts dry, throw some cash into taxable brokerage accounts for flexibility. These accounts let you access your money whenever you want without penalties, making them great for shorter-term goals or an emergency fund.
