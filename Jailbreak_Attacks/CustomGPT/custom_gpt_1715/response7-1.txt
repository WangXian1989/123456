Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires understanding the advantages of each account type and your individual financial goals. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the complete benefit.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you qualify, consider maxing out your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue putting money into your 401(k) until you reach the maximum contribution limit for your age group. 

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve maxed out these tax-advantaged accounts and still have funds to invest, consider putting money into a taxable investment account. This can provide more flexibility with withdrawals and the potential for long-term capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Regardless of how you divide your contributions, make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

It’s also beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs.
