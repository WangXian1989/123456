I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional to get the right diagnosis and treatment. General treatment options for liver issues can vary widely depending on the specific condition, but they may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like procedures or surgery. Always best to get personalized advice from a medical expert!
