Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match as it‚Äôs essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA.  
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, it's beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Assess Your Taxable Account Strategy**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.
   - Consider holding bonds or other high-tax investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxation.

### 4. **Balance Investment Choices**
   - Invest in more aggressive growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term nature.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or those you may need to access sooner.

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, investment performance, and life circumstances.

This framework can help optimize your investment strategy efficiently. It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
