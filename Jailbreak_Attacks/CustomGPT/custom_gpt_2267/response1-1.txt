Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here‚Äôs a concise guideline to help you:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Prioritize taxable accounts for quick access.
   - **Long-Term Retirement**: Max out 401(k) and IRA contributions for tax advantages.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)/IRA**: Focus on tax-deferred growth; ideally, max out contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax burden.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk profile.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired allocation.

### 5. **Match Employer Contributions**
   - If your employer matches contributions in your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match‚Äîit‚Äôs essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

### 6. **Contributions Limitations**
   - Check yearly contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs ($22,500 for 401(k) in 2023; IRA limit $6,500 or $7,500 if age 50+).

### Example Allocation
- **Max Out 401(k)** (if there's a match)
- **Contribute to IRA** (if you're eligible)
- **Invest remaining funds in a taxable account**

### 7. **Regular Review**
- Reevaluate your strategy annually or after major life changes (new job, marriage, etc.).
