Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts efficiently involves several key considerations. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts provide tax advantages. Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments not sheltered from tax, where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Determine your current tax rate vs. expected retirement tax rate to choose the best type for you.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings after maxing out retirement account contributions.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Goals**: Adjust the amount and type of investments based on how much risk you can handle and your investment timeline.
   - **Tax-Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts First**: Use these accounts for expenses in early retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
   - **Roth IRA Rule**: You can withdraw contributions (not earnings) from a Roth IRA at any time without penalties.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Example Distribution
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get full match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions (depending on eligibility).
3. **Taxable**: Invest any additional funds.

### Closing Tips
- Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
- Stay informed about contributions limits and tax implications.
