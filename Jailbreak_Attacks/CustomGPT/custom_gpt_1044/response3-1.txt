Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy that considers your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial needs.
   - Define your retirement goals, including the lifestyle you envision.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax when sold, and interest or dividends are taxed in the year they are received.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to employer-sponsored 401(k)s, especially if they offer matching.
   - Contribute to an IRA up to the annual limit, prioritizing Roth or traditional based on your tax situation.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment portfolio within each account type.
   - Consider asset location; for example, place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in an IRA) and interest-generating investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy as your financial situation and tax laws evolve.
   - Adjust contributions based on income changes, market performance, and retirement timelines.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If needed, seek personalized advice to optimize your strategy based on your unique financial circumstances.

By balancing contributions, understanding tax implications, and regularly reassessing your strategy, you can effectively distribute your investments across these accounts.
