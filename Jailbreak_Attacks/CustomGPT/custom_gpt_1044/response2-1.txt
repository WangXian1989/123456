Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, and investment goals. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible, depending on your income. If eligible, contribute here next.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you meet the income limits, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings in a high-yield savings account or similar for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributions to taxable accounts for flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Within these accounts, strive for a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Annually review your investment allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Suggested Distribution Example:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your salary (max if possible).
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Up to the contribution limit ($6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds after meeting 401(k) and IRA contributions.

### Key Considerations:
- **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors can afford more risk, while those closer to retirement should prioritize stability.
- **Tax Bracket**: Think about your current vs. expected future tax bracket to determine whether to prioritize tax-deferred or tax-free options.

Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.
