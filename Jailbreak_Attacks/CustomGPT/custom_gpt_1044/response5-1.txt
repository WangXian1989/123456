Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are a few strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions if you can (consider both Traditional and Roth IRAs based on your income and tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Itâ€™s also useful for short-term liquidity needs.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Adjust Contributions Based on Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, consider contributing more to tax-deferred accounts. In contrast, if you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth options.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your portfolio allocations and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level, especially as you approach retirement.

A financial advisor can customize these strategies based on your unique situation.
