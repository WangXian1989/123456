I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. Itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit sugar and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Medications**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help reduce liver inflammation.
   - **Medications for Fatty Liver Disease**: Depending on the cause, specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to track liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Vitamin Supplements**: Certain vitamins may support liver health, but always consult a doctor before starting any.

5. **Avoid Toxins**: Reduce exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications and chemicals.
