Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions as well, whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed. Suitable for higher-income years.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, enabling tax-free withdrawals later. Good for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as long-term gains are typically taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider higher growth investments (like stocks) in accounts with tax advantages (401(k), IRAs) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts on interest income.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations in each account to align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Consider which accounts to tap into first based on tax implications.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can provide a strategy that considers your unique circumstances.

This approach can help balance growth potential with tax efficiency.
