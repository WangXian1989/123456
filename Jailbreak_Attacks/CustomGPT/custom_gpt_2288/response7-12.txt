I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit sugar and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe medications to address the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where liver function is significantly diminished, a transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some patients benefit from vitamins or herbs (like milk thistle), but you should discuss any supplements with your doctor first.

It's essential to work with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action based on your specific situation.
