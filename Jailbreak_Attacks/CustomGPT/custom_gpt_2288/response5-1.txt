(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Assessing Liquidity Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, consider putting more in taxable accounts, as you can withdraw without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to balance risk.

5. **Continually Evaluate**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.
