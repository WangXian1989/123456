Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing it out if your employer does not offer a match.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth offers tax-free growth, while the Traditional offers tax deductions now.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**
   - For long-term investments, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - For shorter-term goals, focus on taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Balance and Diversify**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Rebalance periodically to ensure alignment with your strategy.

Evaluate your specific situation with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your needs.
