Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers matching contributions for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for higher tax brackets.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), it can offer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gain flexibility for withdrawals but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Prioritize Accounts**:
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for accessible funds.
   - **Medium to Long-Term Goals**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA for growth potential.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) due to their tax-deferred status.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable assets (like bonds) that generate interest, which can incur higher taxes if held in a tax-advantaged account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically based on market conditions and your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized strategies can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.

It's essential to evaluate your specific financial situation and consider consulting a financial planner for personalized guidance.
