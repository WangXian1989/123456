Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match – it’s free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions to traditional 401(k) plans are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider contributing to both a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). This gives you flexibility in retirement withdrawals.
   - **Annual Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and over in 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or to hold investments that may generate tax-efficient income, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before maximizing retirement accounts.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Diversify your investment choices within each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Monitor and Adjust**: Review your allocations periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
