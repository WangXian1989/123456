Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), impacting your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes; consider this for long-term investments to minimize tax impact.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

3. **Assess Your Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k) and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 if over age 50), while for IRAs, it’s $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50).

4. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Generally, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Investment Strategy**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Balanced Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Different assets might perform better in different account types.

7. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Revisit your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes (e.g., changes in income, market conditions, or life events).

By applying these principles, you can create a tailored approach that meets your long-term financial goals while considering tax efficiency.
