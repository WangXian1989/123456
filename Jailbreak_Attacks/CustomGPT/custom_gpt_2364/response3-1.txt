Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth; employer matches are a bonus.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access but subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) after maximizing the match.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings needs or after exhausting tax-advantaged options.

### 3. **Consider Tax Impact:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on growth investments in your 401(k) and Traditional IRA, as gains won’t be taxed until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends) or for short-term goals.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you’re closer to retirement, it might make sense to have a different balance, focusing more on safety and income in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have enough liquid savings outside these accounts for emergencies, usually 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly check your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation and help optimize your distribution among these accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 20%
- **IRA:** 20%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10%
- **Emergency Fund/Other Savings:** 50%

Adjust these percentages based on your goals and risk tolerance.
