Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional savings in a taxable account. This provides flexibility for early withdrawals and can be beneficial for long-term investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or tax-managed funds) and consider holding bonds or high-yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Investment Horizon**: If retirement is many years away, focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts. As you approach retirement, shift toward more conservative investments.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your allocations to align with changing goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
