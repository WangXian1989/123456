Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for tax-deferred growth and often includes employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Offers tax advantages, with Roth IRAs providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible with no tax advantages, but capital gains are taxed.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: This is effectively free money.
   - **Consider IRA contributions**: Depending on your income, either traditional or Roth may be beneficial.
   - **Fill taxable accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest remaining funds here.

### 3. **Investing Approach**:
   - **401(k)**: Use low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Diversify with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of tax efficiency; consider tax-exempt bonds or index funds.

### 4. **Review Tax Implications**:
   - Capital gains, dividends, and interest from taxable accounts are subject to taxation. 
   - Consider asset location strategies, placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - Short-term savings may be better in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Long-term growth should prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Periodically adjust your investment allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your specific circumstances.

By strategically allocating funds in this manner, you can take advantage of tax benefits while aligning with your investment goals.
