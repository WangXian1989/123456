Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you can. Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year.

### 3. **IRA Contributions:**
   - After your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high income or capital gains, since they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Additionally, keep funds for short-term goals or emergencies here.

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. For instance, you might hold bonds in your taxable account to take advantage of lower tax rates, while keeping growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation over time.

### 7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Be mindful of your current and expected tax situations to optimize your contributions and withdrawals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (to max out employer match)
- **IRA**: Up to the annual contribution limit, focusing on Roth if you qualify
- **Taxable**: Any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for additional investments.

### Conclusion:
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
