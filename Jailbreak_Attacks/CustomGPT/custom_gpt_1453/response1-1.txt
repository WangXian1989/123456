Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for reducing your current taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds can be accessed anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains.

### Strategy:

- **Short-term Needs**: Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Retirement Savings**: Max out 401(k) contributions up to the employer match, then consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Long-term Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that produce less taxable income (e.g., index funds).

### General Tip:
Ensure a diversified investment portfolio to spread risk while aligning with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider regularly reviewing and rebalancing your allocations based on changes in your financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
