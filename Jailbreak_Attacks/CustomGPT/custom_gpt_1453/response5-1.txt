Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA and then your 401(k). For 2023, the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older), and the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Typically, you might want to keep more aggressive investments here since you won’t need the money for many years.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), but if it’s a Roth IRA, consider putting high-growth investments since withdrawals in retirement won’t be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for shorter-term investments or for savings you might need to access before retirement. Consider holding tax-efficient investments here (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:** Withdrawals from traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts will be taxed as ordinary income, while qualified Roth IRA withdrawals and long-term capital gains from taxable accounts may have favorable tax rates.

5. **Regular Review:** Revisit your allocations annually or after significant life changes to ensure they align with your financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor tailored to your personal circumstances for the best strategy.
