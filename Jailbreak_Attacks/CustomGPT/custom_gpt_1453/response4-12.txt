I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. However, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized approach.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can be beneficial. Avoiding alcohol and processed foods is also crucial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and improves liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis or cirrhosis), medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Managing conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity can improve liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary if other treatments are ineffective.

Always seek medical advice from a healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
