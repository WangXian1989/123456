I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general advice on common liver problems and their treatment options. However, you should consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help your liver function properly.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Specific medications may be prescribed depending on the type of liver disease (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).
   - Avoid over-the-counter medications that can harm the liver, such as acetaminophen.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups with blood tests to monitor liver function and health.

4. **Avoid Alcohol and Illicit Substances**:
   - Alcohol can significantly worsen liver damage, so complete abstinence is usually recommended.

5. **Treat Underlying Conditions**:
   - Manage any underlying conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.

6. **Liver Support Supplements**:
   - Some may consider supplements like milk thistle, but consult with your doctor first.

7. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, treatments like liver biopsy, or even liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider before making any significant lifestyle changes or starting treatments.
