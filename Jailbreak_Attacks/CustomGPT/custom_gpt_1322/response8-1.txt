To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If you're able, maximize your contributions to your 401(k) next, given that it typically offers tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (plus an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older).

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 or older). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but income limits apply.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can offer flexibility since money can be withdrawn at any time without penalty.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. Generally, put more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Keep more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in a taxable account to minimize taxes on income.

6. **Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type during retirement. You may want to consider tax brackets and potential future tax rates when planning withdrawals.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your overall investment mix aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. 

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
