When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Before moving to IRAs or taxable accounts, max out contributions to your 401(k), especially if a match is available. In 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). The limits for 2023 are $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Remember that traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, while withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Roth accounts, on the other hand, use after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you still have funds to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, put the remaining funds in taxable accounts. Here, you can invest in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, with the flexibility to withdraw without penalties. However, be cautious of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the accounts you contribute to, ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes to spread risk.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Donâ€™t forget about maintaining a cash reserve for emergencies, typically 3-6 months of living expenses, which should be kept outside of these investment accounts.

Consider your individual financial situation, including your tax bracket, retirement goals, and any employer benefits, when allocating your funds. It can be very beneficial to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your unique circumstances.
