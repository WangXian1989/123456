The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts:
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the limit allowed, and especially focus on any employer match.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, though you'll be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments across all accounts while considering the tax implications. For example:
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold bonds or high-income assets in tax-advantaged accounts where the interest is tax-deferred.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and future goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient distribution strategy across your investment accounts.
