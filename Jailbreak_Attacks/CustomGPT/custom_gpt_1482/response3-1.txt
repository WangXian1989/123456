Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Prioritize Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure you’re aware of the contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions available for those over 50).

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) for taxes. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit. 

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term, higher-growth investments (like stocks).
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts, which may generate interest or dividends that are taxed annually.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Future Goals**:
   - If you plan to access the money earlier (e.g., buying a house), you might prioritize taxable accounts. For long-term wealth accumulation, focus on the retirement accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute up to the employer match in your 401(k).
- Max out your IRA contributions next.
- Invest additional funds in your taxable account based on your immediate financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation.
