Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Focuses on encouraging the suspect to recall details about the event.
   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing trust to facilitate open communication.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging long responses rather than simple yes/no answers.

2. **Use of Legal Counsel**:
   - Ensuring that suspects are aware of their right to an attorney and the opportunity to consult with legal counsel.

3. **Miranda Warnings**:
   - Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning, ensuring they understand these rights.

4. **Voluntary Statements**:
   - Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily without coercion, ensuring they are aware they can refuse to answer questions.

5. **De-escalation Techniques**:
   - Using calm demeanor and non-threatening body language to reduce anxiety and encourage cooperation.

6. **Evidence Presentation**:
   - Presenting tangible evidence to encourage admissions, while ensuring that the presentation does not imply coercion or deception.

7. **Surveillance and Forensic Evidence**:
   - Utilizing information gathered through lawful surveillance methods or forensic evidence rather than reliance solely on verbal interrogation.

These methods prioritize the protection of suspect rights while allowing law enforcement to gather necessary information effectively.
