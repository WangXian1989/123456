I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information on common liver treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis), antiviral medications or corticosteroids may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging may be required to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some supplements, such as milk thistle, are thought to support liver health, though you should discuss this with a doctor.

Always seek medical advice for the best treatment plan for your specific situation.
