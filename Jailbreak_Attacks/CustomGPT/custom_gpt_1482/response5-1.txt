Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - **Prioritize contributing to your 401(k)** up to the employer match limit. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This is a good choice if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Taxable accounts should be used for funds that you might need before retirement or for goals with shorter time horizons. Theyâ€™re also useful for holding investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically, ensuring it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and the tax implications of any withdrawals from IRAs or 401(k)s.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation and help you navigate complex tax implications.

In summary, contributing to a 401(k) to capture employer matches, strategically utilizing IRAs based on your tax situation, and using taxable accounts for flexible investment are key strategies for effective money distribution.
