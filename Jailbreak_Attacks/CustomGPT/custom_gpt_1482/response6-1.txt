Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income now. Consider maxing out employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible, so they can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax, so consider them for more liquid investments or shorter-term goals.

### 2. **Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-term Goals** (retirement, education): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they offer tax benefits over the long run.
   - **Short-term Goals** (buying a house, travel): Use taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification Goals**
   - Ensure a good mix of assets (stocks, bonds) across accounts to balance risk and return. 
   - Consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where your gains won't be taxed until withdrawal.

It's often best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
