Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax benefits.
   - **401(k)**: If possible, increase your contributions to the 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

### 3. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months' expenses) in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - After your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts, keeping in mind tax implications of capital gains in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial professional who can tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

### Conclusion:
Strategically prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then funding taxable accounts, can maximize growth while minimizing taxes.
