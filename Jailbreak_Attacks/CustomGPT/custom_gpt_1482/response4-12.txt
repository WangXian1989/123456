Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugar can help reduce liver strain.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral infections like Hepatitis B or C.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Supplements**:
   - **Vitamin E**: Sometimes suggested for certain liver conditions.

4. **Procedures**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, when the liver is failing.

5. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a tailored approach.
