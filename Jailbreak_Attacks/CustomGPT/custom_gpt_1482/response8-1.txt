Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. Here’s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributing enough to get the full employer match if available. It’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, benefiting you during high earning years.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Determine whether a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) better fits your long-term tax strategy.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Max out your IRA contributions if possible, as they often provide a broader range of investment options compared to a 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, in these accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### General Guidelines:
- **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified.
- **Rebalance:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement to optimize tax efficiency.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of income (enough to get the match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Final Thoughts
Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual situation and goals.
