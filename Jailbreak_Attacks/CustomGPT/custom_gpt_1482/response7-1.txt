To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if affordable, keeping in mind the contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth grows tax-free.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect your income to be higher in retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA might be beneficial. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, Roth accounts could be more advantageous.

3. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Assess the investment choices within each account. Generally, hold higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth. Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (e.g., municipal bonds).

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Utilize taxable accounts for money you may need in the short term or for flexibility. These can hold cash or bonds, which can also provide liquidity when required.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investment strategy across accounts based on performance and changes in financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation, particularly for more complex distributions or tax strategies.

Establishing a balanced approach that considers savings goals, taxation, and liquidity will help optimize your overall investment strategy.
