Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if possible, especially in pre-tax contributions.
- **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income and tax bracket.

### 2. Balance Tax Considerations
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that can benefit from capital gains treatment, like stocks or stock index funds, while holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Diversification
- Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider asset allocation strategies based on your risk tolerance and investment time frame.

### 4. Regularly Review and Rebalance
- Periodically reassess your allocations based on market performance and life changes (like income increase, marriage, or children).

### Summary
- Start with employer 401(k) match.  
- Max out your IRA next.  
- Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts as needed. 

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investments and tax efficiency.
