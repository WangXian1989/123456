Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These are flexible but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth-oriented investments.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold bond funds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax burdens.

It's wise to review your allocations periodically and adjust based on changing financial circumstances and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
