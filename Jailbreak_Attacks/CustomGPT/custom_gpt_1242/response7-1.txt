Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which is advantageous for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll pay capital gains tax on any investment earnings; consider holding long-term investments to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA Investments:** Focus on a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets suited to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use a tax-efficient investment strategy, like index funds or ETFs, to reduce capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, withdraw from tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) first to maximize tax-free growth in Roth accounts.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (to max out employer match)
- **IRA:** $6,500 annual contribution if eligible
- **Taxable:** Any remaining savings for flexibility

### Regular Review:
Reassess your allocations annually or after major life events (job change, marriage, etc.) to ensure they align with your financial goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
For personalized advice, consider talking to a financial advisor, especially if your situation is complex.
