Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to employer-sponsored plans, like a 401(k), especially if there's a match. This can effectively double your contributions.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction upfront, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable investment account for additional savings. This account is flexible for withdrawals but will incur capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments may go into tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: In retirement, take withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.
