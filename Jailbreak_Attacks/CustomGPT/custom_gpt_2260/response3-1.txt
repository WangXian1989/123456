Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, pre-tax contributions, often with an employer match. Great for long-term retirement savings and tax advantages.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Individual accounts. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes, suitable for short- to mid-term goals and more flexible withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize putting assets with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with lower expected returns or those that produce regular income (like bonds), which can be taxed.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors might favor more aggressive investments (stocks) in retirement accounts, while older investors might want to stabilize with bonds.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial, delaying withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts.

### Summary
A balanced approach often looks like:

1. Max out your 401(k) contributions, meeting the employer match.
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments.
