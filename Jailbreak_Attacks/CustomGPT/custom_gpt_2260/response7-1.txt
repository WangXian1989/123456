Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase.
   - **401(k):** After getting the match, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k). Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth contributions offer tax-free growth.

### 3. **Diversify Between Account Types:**
   - A mix of pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) accounts provides flexibility in tax management during retirement.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - For long-term investments, take more risks in your tax-advantaged accounts since withdrawals will be in the future. In taxable accounts, prioritize preserving capital and generating income.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Review your strategy regularly to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

Balancing contributions effectively can help maximize your retirement savings while managing tax implications.
