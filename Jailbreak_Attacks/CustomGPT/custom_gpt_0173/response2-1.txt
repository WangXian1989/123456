To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Use for tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for flexible access to funds and investments. Ideal for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments**: Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth assets like stocks, which benefit most from tax deferral.
   - **Income-Producing Investments**: Hold bonds and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize the impact of ordinary income taxes.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan withdrawals based on tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first for short-term needs, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering the different tax implications of each account.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and tax circumstances.

### Example Breakdown
- Max out your 401(k) match, then contribute to IRA (consider Roth for younger investors).
- Invest excess funds in a taxable account.

### Conclusion
By leveraging the tax advantages and strategic allocation of your investments, you can enhance growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
