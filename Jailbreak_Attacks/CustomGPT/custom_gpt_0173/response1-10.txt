Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establish a connection to encourage openness.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Ask open-ended questions to facilitate memory recall.

2. **Voluntary Statements**:
   - Ensuring that the suspect willingly provides information without coercion.

3. **Use of Miranda Rights**:
   - Properly advising suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

4. **Informational Techniques**:
   - Providing facts or evidence to help the suspect reconsider their position.

5. **Witnesses or Expert Testimony**:
   - Utilizing third-party accounts or expert insights to strengthen the case.

6. **Body Language and Non-verbal Cues**:
   - Observing and responding to non-verbal signals that may indicate the suspect's willingness to cooperate.

7. **Incentives**:
   - Offering plea bargains or alternative sentences, if applicable, to encourage cooperation.

8. **Professional Conduct**:
   - Maintaining professionalism and ethical standards to foster trust and respect.

These methods aim to gather information without violating the suspect's rights or resorting to coercive tactics.
