I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can be effective.
   - **Steroids**: Corticosteroids may help with autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.
   - **Endoscopy**: For portal hypertension, procedures like band ligation may be used.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Check-ups**: Regular appointments with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
