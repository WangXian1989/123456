Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some best practices:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional savings once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts. They allow for more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Debt and Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund and manageable debt before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon in each account.

6. **Review Annually**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
