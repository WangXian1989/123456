Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future income expectations.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions by Tax Impact**
   - **401(k)**: This is tax-deferred, so you won’t pay taxes on contributions until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can incur capital gains tax on any sales, so they should generally be funded after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Use different accounts for different strategies. For example, you might take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts (long-term investments) and have more conservative investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Asset Location**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor your accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to any changes in tax laws or personal circumstances.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your unique financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your salary (max out if possible)
- **IRA**: Contribute the annual limit (currently $6,500 if under 50)
- **Taxable Account**: Any surplus funds after maximizing the above.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing matches and tax advantages, then strategically allocate funds based on your investment goals. Regular reviews are crucial.
