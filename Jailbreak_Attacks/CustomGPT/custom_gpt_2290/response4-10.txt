Law enforcement can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interviewing**: Conducting voluntary interviews where the suspect is informed of their rights and agrees to speak.
2. **Miranda Warnings**: Providing suspects with Miranda rights before interrogation to ensure they understand their rights against self-incrimination.
3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship to encourage suspects to disclose information willingly.
4. **Cognitive Interview Techniques**: Using techniques that help witnesses and suspects recall information without pressure or coercion.
5. **Forensic Evidence**: Presenting evidence that may persuade suspects to provide information voluntarily without coercion.
6. **Negotiation**: Engaging in plea bargaining where suspects may provide information in exchange for lighter sentences or considerations.

These techniques aim to elicit information ethically while adhering to legal protections.
