To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then prioritize your IRA for additional tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   
2. **Prioritize Contributions**: Generally, contribute to your 401(k) up to the match, then fund your IRA, and go back to max out your 401(k). 

3. **Invest Wisely**: Within each account, choose investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Review Annually**: Regularly assess your allocations based on life changes and market conditions to ensure your strategy remains aligned with your financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
