To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your IRA and 401(k) as they offer tax benefits. Decide between traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) contributions based on your current and future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends or interest) or for funds you might need before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon, keeping in mind the tax implications of selling assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your asset allocation as needed based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
