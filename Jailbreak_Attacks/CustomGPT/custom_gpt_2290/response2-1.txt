Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** Fund your IRA next, as it offers potential tax advantages (traditional vs. Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maxed out retirement accounts. They're flexible and can be accessed anytime without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency:** Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in an IRA) and income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can tailor a strategy to your specific situation. 

Aim for a balanced approach based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
