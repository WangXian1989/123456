To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts for long-term savings.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if there's an employer match, as it's essentially "free money." After that, contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy across all accounts is diversified. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and consider holding higher-growth investments (which may be taxed more heavily) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, wait to withdraw from taxable accounts until required minimum distributions (RMDs) kick in from retirement accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

6. **Goals and Risk Tolerance**: Consider your long-term goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance when allocating funds among the accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.
