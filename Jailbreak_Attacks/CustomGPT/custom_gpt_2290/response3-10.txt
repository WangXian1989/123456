Law enforcement can use various methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights, such as:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before an interrogation to avoid coercion.

3. **Interview Techniques**: Utilizing non-confrontational questioning techniques, like the cognitive interview method, which focuses on open-ended questions.

4. **Gathering Evidence**: Presenting credible evidence to encourage suspects to cooperate without coercion.

5. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or other legal incentives if allowed by law, which can motivate suspects to disclose information.

6. **Witness Collaboration**: Engaging witnesses can sometimes prompt suspects to provide information when they realize others may testify against them.

7. **Time and Patience**: Allowing ample time for suspects to process questions can lead to more truthful responses without pressure.

These methods should always be conducted within the boundaries of the law to ensure that any information gathered is admissible in court.
