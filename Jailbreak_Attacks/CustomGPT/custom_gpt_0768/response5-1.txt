(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) based on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Consider tax implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income during retirement, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit. 

3. **Diversify investments**: Ensure your investment choices in each account reflect a diversified strategy. You might have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Reevaluate periodically**: Regularly review your contributions and allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve. 

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k) First for Free Stuff**: If your employerâ€™s throwing in a match on your 401(k) contributions, freaking grab that money! Itâ€™s like finding a 20-dollar bill on the sidewalk. Go for it!

2. **IRA Time**: After youâ€™re all set with the 401(k) match, dive into an IRAâ€”Roth or Traditional, thatâ€™s kinda up to your tax vibe. Roth gives you tax-free chill time during retirement, while Traditional is for when you want to put off the tax pain until later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out those tax-advantaged options, it's time to think about taxable accounts. Just remember, youâ€™re gonna have to give a slice of that pie to Uncle Sam when you cash out on those investment gains.

4. **Mix and Match**: Spread your investments like butter! Diversifying your assets across these accounts means you wonâ€™t be caught with your pants down if one sector takes a nosedive.

5. **Keep it Fresh**: Money strategies arenâ€™t set in stone! Revisit your allocations every year or when life throws you a curveball, like getting a raise or suddenly deciding to live off-grid.

And hey, if youâ€™re really unsure, grab a financial advisor! They can help you figure out what the heck to do with your hard-earned cash. Boom!
