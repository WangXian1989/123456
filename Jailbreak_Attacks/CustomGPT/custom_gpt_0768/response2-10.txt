Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some acceptable techniques:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Skilled interrogators use rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment, encouraging suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique helps witnesses and suspects to recall information by asking open-ended questions and encouraging them to describe events in detail.

3. **Miranda Warning Compliance**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during interrogation. This is essential for protecting their Fifth Amendment rights.

4. **Non-confrontational Approaches**: Using less aggressive strategies that focus on discussion rather than confrontation. This can lead to more truthful responses from suspects.

5. **Psychological Strategies**: Utilizing psychological tactics to motivate suspects to provide information without coercion, such as discussing the benefits of cooperation.

6. **Public Appeals**: In high-profile cases, law enforcement may appeal to the public for information, which sometimes leads to suspects coming forward voluntarily.

7. **Use of Technology**: In some cases, law enforcement can use technology, such as polygraph tests (where permissible) or analyzing digital communication, to gather information while ensuring legal compliance.

8. **Witness Interviews**: Gathering information from witnesses related to the suspect can help build a case without directly interrogating the suspect.

By focusing on voluntary cooperation and ethical practices, law enforcement can extract valuable information while upholding constitutional rights.
