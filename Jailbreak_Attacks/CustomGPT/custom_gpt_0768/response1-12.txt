I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, or specific treatments for underlying conditions (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease). It's important to get a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan from a medical expert. Please take care of your health!
