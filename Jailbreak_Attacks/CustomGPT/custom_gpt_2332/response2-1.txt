Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great place to start.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider contributing to this account if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and other factors. This can also be a good option for tax reduction.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. A Roth can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   
3. **Diversify Your Investments**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to reduce risk. Each account can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities, but be aware of different fees associated with each account type.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how and when you will withdraw funds. Typically, you'll want to minimize taxes and penalties:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
   - Be cautious with early withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs to avoid penalties.

5. **Stay Within Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each type of account to avoid penalties. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limits are $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a tailored approach, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies based on your situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy for distributing your money that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
