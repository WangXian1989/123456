To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may give you immediate tax benefits.

2. **Allocate Based on Investment Goals**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Different accounts may have different investment strategies based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. High-growth investments could be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind your need for accessible funds. Taxable accounts can provide easier access if you need cash before retirement.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across your accounts to spread risk effectively, taking advantage of different types of investments.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type to optimize your distributions in retirement.

By strategically allocating your investments, you can maximize growth while minimizing taxes and aligning with your financial goals.
