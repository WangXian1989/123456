Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some common strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Tax Implications**: 
   - Distributing investments in tax-efficient ways can help: 
     - Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA).
     - Use your taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as stocks that qualify for long-term capital gains.

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: 
   - Allocate based on your investment horizon. Short-term goals may be better served in safer investments, while long-term goals could benefit from riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - As market conditions change, regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all account types to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, it might make sense to use taxable accounts to minimize tax-deferred account withdrawals when you're in a lower bracket.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. It may be beneficial to draw from a combination of accounts to manage your tax liability.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor a distribution strategy that meets your specific needs and goals.
