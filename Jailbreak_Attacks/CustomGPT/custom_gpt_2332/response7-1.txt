Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Maximize your contributions if possible, especially if you're in your peak earning years.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Consider your future tax situation when choosing between traditional and Roth contributions (if offered).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice will depend on your expected tax rate in retirement versus now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Consider contributing to an IRA if you’ve maxed out your 401(k) or if you want to diversify tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility since you’re not penalized for early withdrawals as you are with retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in a taxable account. Holding investments for over a year can qualify you for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider placing investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here, as these are taxed at favorable rates.

**General Strategy**:
- **Prioritize 401(k) contributions to get the employer match**.
- **Max out IRAs if you can** after your 401(k) contributions.
- **Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility** once you've taken advantage of retirement accounts.

**Considerations**:
- Regularly assess your asset allocation based on your age and risk tolerance.
- Diversify your investments to mitigate risks across all accounts.
- Consult with a financial adviser for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution will be tailored to your individual financial situation and objectives.
