Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are a few techniques:

1. **Rapport Building**: Establishing a connection with the suspect can create an environment of trust, encouraging them to share information willingly.
   - Use active listening to show understanding and empathy.
   - Engage in friendly conversation to lower defenses.

2. **Interrogation Techniques**: Certain questioning techniques can be effective without coercion.
   - The Reid Technique focuses on non-confrontational questioning and psychological strategies.
   - Employ open-ended questions to allow suspects to provide more detail in their responses.

It's important for law enforcement to remain mindful of the suspect's legal rights throughout the process to ensure any information obtained is admissible in court.
