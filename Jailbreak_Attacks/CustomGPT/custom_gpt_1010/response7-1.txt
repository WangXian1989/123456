I’m sorry, but I can't provide personalized financial advice. However, I can give you a general overview of how to think about distributing your money among these accounts.

In general, a common strategy is to prioritize your contributions based on tax advantages:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match first—it's essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you may be eligible for a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility, although you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

Balancing your investments across these types of accounts can help you achieve a good mix of tax advantages and flexibility. It’s recommended to consult with a financial advisor for a strategy tailored to your specific situation.
