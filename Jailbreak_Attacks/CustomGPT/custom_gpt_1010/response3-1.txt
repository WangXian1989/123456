I'm sorry, but I can't provide personalized financial advice. However, I can offer some general information about how individuals might approach distributing their money among different types of accounts:

1. **401(k):** Many employers offer matching contributions, so maximizing contributions to a 401(k) to take full advantage of any matches is often a priority. This account provides tax benefits now (traditional 401(k)) or in the future (Roth 401(k)).

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Depending on your eligibility, contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA can further enhance your retirement savings. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, a taxable account can be beneficial for additional savings or investments, particularly for short-term goals. Keep in mind that capital gains and dividends in this account incur taxes.

A balanced approach typically involves considering factors such as your current tax situation, retirement goals, investment timeline, and the benefits of each type of account. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized recommendations tailored to your circumstances.
