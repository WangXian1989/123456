It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts! While I can't provide personalized financial advice, I can offer some general principles that might help guide your decision-making:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offered by employers, this account allows pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income. Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (after-tax contributions). The choice here can impact your taxes now versus in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, but you'll owe taxes on capital gains and dividends in the year they're realized.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Consider maxing out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is often the best return on investment.
   - Depending on your income and tax situation, you might also want to contribute to an IRA, especially if you qualify for Roth contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs or 401(k)s).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to appreciate over time and generate lower capital gains, such as stocks.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that you're diversifying your assets across all accounts to spread risk, considering factors like your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and retirement goals.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Your financial situation and the market can change, so it's important to regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances, goals, and risk profile.

By considering these principles, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Good luck!
