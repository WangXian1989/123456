It's crucial to consider a few factors when deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general strategies that might help:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if you have not yet taken full advantage of the annual limit. This can lower your taxable income for the year.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA depending on your income levels and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met, while traditional IRAs may allow for a tax deduction.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts provide more flexibility in terms of accessing your money without penalties. However, they may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider the tax implications of investments you hold here.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes and sectors regardless of the account type. This helps reduce risk.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: When investing, consider the tax efficiency of different investments. For instance, holding tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts while keeping bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts can be a smart strategy.

7. **Retirement Goals**: Tailor your account allocation based on your retirement goals, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. 

8. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and be prepared to adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
