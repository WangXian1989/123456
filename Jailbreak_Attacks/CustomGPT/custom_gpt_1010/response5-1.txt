(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and individual circumstances. Here are a few general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, depending on which type aligns with your tax strategy. IRAs often have more investment choices than 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments beyond your retirement accounts. These accounts offer flexibility with withdrawals, but they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

Balancing contributions among these accounts can enhance your investment growth and tax efficiency over time. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k) Bliss**: If your workplace is ready to match your contributions, grab that money like it's a hot deal on Black Friday! Always put in enough to snag the full employer match before dipping anywhere else. Itâ€™s like free lottery tickets!

2. **IRA Shenanigans**: Next, think about your IRA. If you're feeling the tax vibe, a Roth IRA could be your jam. You pay taxes upfront, then watch the magic grow tax-free! If taxes are on your mind down the line, consider a Traditional IRA - everyone loves a good tax break now, don't they?

3. **Taxable Accounts Party**: Lastly, once youâ€™re all set with tax-advantaged accounts, throw some cash into taxable accounts for more freedom. Want to pull out some dough for a new toy? No problem! Just remember, you'll be dancing with capital gains taxes on those gains. 

Mixing it up smartly will give you that financial swagger and keep Uncle Sam a bit at bay. And hey, maybe chat with a financial wiz for the best personalized moves!
