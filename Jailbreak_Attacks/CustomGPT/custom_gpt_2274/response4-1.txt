Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out this account if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you might prefer a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are versatile but don't offer tax advantages like the other accounts. Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Utilize asset allocation strategies that align investments with your risk tolerance across all accounts. For example, you might hold higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks), while keeping more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation. This can involve shifting funds between accounts based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Plan Withdrawals Strategically**: Consider tax implications on withdrawals during retirement to maximize your income and minimize taxes.

It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
