To distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match because it's essentially "free money." Aim to contribute at least enough to take advantage of this benefit.

2. **Balance Contributions:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to benefit from the tax advantages they offer. Depending on your income and tax situation, you might choose a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential current tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** Use tax-efficient investment strategies. Generally, place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure that your asset allocation reflects your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon across all accounts. Consider diversifying between stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your accounts and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. Rebalance your portfolio if necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Plan Withdrawals Strategically:** When it comes time to withdraw funds, be strategic about which accounts to draw from first to minimize your tax burden.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
