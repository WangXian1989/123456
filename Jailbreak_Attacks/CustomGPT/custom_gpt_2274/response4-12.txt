I'm not a doctor, but addressing liver problems typically involves lifestyle changes and medical interventions depending on the specific condition. Here are some general treatment options that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: 
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption and avoiding exposure to harmful substances can prevent further liver damage.

5. **Vaccinations**: 
   - Vaccinations for hepatitis A and B if you're at risk can help protect your liver.

6. **In severe cases**: 
   - Surgical options such as liver transplant may be considered if there is significant liver failure or damage.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment tailored to your specific condition.
