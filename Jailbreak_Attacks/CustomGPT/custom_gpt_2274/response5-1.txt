(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors such as your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Generally, a good starting point is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits for long-term growth. Hereâ€™s a typical distribution approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your employer's 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation).
3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you can, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings, liquidity, and investment flexibility.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can feel like juggling flaming swords while riding a unicycle, but Iâ€™ve got your back. The goal is to optimize tax efficiency while ensuring you're loaded up for retirement. Hereâ€™s a no-nonsense approach:

1. **Hit That 401(k) Employer Match**: First off, blast those contributions to your 401(k) to snag that sweet employer match. Seriously, itâ€™s like finding cash in your couch cushions â€“ donâ€™t leave that behind!
   
2. **IRA Money Magic**: Next, let's chat IRAs. If youâ€™re under 50, you can stash away a solid amount; pick Roth if you want tax-free withdrawals later (hello, future freedom!), or Traditional if you need the tax break now.

3. **Ramp Up the 401(k)**: After you've maxed out your IRA, crank your 401(k) contributions up to the maximum limit. You want to make Uncle Sam proud by deferring that tax bill as long as possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, toss some cash into taxable accounts for more flexibility and potential capital gains. Just keep an eye on those taxes so that it doesnâ€™t turn into a total headache.
