Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth IRAs) if eligible.
   - If you have additional savings after funding your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax treatment.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax; consider this if you're planning to sell investments.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Depending on your investment strategy, you may want to allocate different assets across these accounts. For example, you might hold more equitable (higher growth potential) assets in your Roth IRA due to its tax-free withdrawal benefit.

4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep in mind that contributions to retirement accounts often have penalties for early withdrawal (before age 59Â½). Therefore, maintain an appropriate amount of cash or liquid assets in your taxable account for short-term needs.

5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly as your financial goals and market conditions change.

6. **Consult With a Financial Advisor:**
   - It might be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial professional who can assess your unique situation and help create a tailored strategy.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution among these accounts will depend on your individual financial situation and goals.
