Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are a few tips:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money. Next, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your situation) since they also offer tax advantages.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:** Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions reduce your taxable income, while withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Roth accounts, on the other hand, have contributions made with after-tax dollars but allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Understanding your current tax bracket and expected tax situation in retirement can help you decide the best account to prioritize.

3. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement should consider more conservative investments.

4. **Consider Your Liquidity Needs:** Taxable accounts are more accessible if you need to withdraw funds before retirement age without penalties. Make sure you have enough liquidity for emergencies or planned expenses without dipping into your retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:** As your investments grow and market conditions change, itâ€™s essential to review your asset allocation and adjust contributions to maintain your desired risk level.

It can be helpful to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy specifically for your situation.
