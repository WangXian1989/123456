Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and offers an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t offer the same tax advantages, so they may be best for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that generate capital gains or dividends.

3. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. You can adjust your allocations based on the accounts' tax implications. For example, it might make sense to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and high-growth investments (like stocks) in retirement accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before tying up too much money in retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Revisit your investment allocations periodically to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance, especially as you get closer to retirement.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances and goals.
