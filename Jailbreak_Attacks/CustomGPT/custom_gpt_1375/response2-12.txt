I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to reach out to a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. They can provide the best treatment options based on your specific condition. Typically, options may include lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes more advanced treatments depending on the issue. Make sure to consult with a doctor to get tailored guidance!
