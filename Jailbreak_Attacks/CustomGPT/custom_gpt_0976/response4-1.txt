To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions to benefit from this tax advantage.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you can either get a tax deduction now (Traditional) or enjoy tax-free withdrawals later (Roth). Weigh the benefits based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be a good place for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, which are taxed differently than ordinary income. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize liabilities.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA. For medium-term goals (like buying a house), consider more of your funds in taxable accounts.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts. This is essentially “free money.”

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), and consider the tax implications of your choices—some investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in tax laws, your income, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

By balancing contributions across these accounts thoughtfully, you can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential.
