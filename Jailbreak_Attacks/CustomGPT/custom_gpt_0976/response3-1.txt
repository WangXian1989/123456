Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax (tax-deferred).
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts with different tax advantages; Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: These are regular investment accounts subject to capital gains taxes on profits, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Fund Roth IRA (if eligible)**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider maxing this account next for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you have room in your budget, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for additional tax benefits, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the above options, increase your contributions to your 401(k) to the maximum allowed limit.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments (like stocks) to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes when you sell.

### 4. **Allocate Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of mutual funds or ETFs based on your risk tolerance. Target-date funds can be a good option for hands-off investing.
   - **IRA**: Similar diversification with a focus on long-term growth; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and potentially alternative investments.
   - **Taxable Account**: Focus on capital gains tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, and consider utilizing tax-loss harvesting.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Rebalance your portfolio at least annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retiree timeline. Adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your life circumstances.

### Summary
A well-rounded approach would be to maximize your contributions to your 401(k) for the employer match, fund your Roth IRA if eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA, and then fill in any gaps using a taxable account. Always consider your tax situation and investment goals when making decisions.

If you have specific goals or circumstances, those can also significantly influence your strategy!
