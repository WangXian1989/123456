Balancing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for maximizing savings and tax efficiency. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money." Focus on maxing out your contributions if you can, as these grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA Options**: Consider opening an IRA (Traditional or Roth). If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial, allowing tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, a Traditional IRA provides immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement or for specific short-term goals. They can also be beneficial if you wish to invest in assets that don’t fit into your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications. For taxable accounts, consider placing lower-growth, tax-efficient investments (like bonds and index funds) to minimize tax exposure on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

It's often useful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your unique situation.

### Key Considerations:
- Maximize employer matches in your 401(k).
- Choose between Traditional vs. Roth based on future tax expectations.
- Keep your financial goals in mind when distributing investments across account types.
