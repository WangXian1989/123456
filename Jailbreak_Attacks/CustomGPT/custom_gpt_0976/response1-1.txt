Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly affect your long-term financial health. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Max out your 401(k) contribution limits after getting the match. In 2024, the limit is $23,000 or $30,000 if you're 50 or older (including catch-up contributions).

### 3. **Debt Management**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before heavily investing, as it can provide a guaranteed return on your money.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you’re maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age.

### 5. **Investment Diversification**
   - Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money to optimize growth while considering your personal financial goals.
