The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can be beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for funds you may need before retirement or for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses) in a savings account.

### 4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors may prioritize growth (higher percentages in stocks), while those closer to retirement might prioritize capital preservation (more in bonds).
   - Adjust your allocation based on your comfort with risk.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Distribute investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all three account types to manage risk and enhance returns.

### 6. **Annual Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over age 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50).

### 7. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

### Examples of Allocation Strategy:
- **Aggressive Growth:** 401(k) (60%), Roth IRA (30%), Taxable Accounts (10%)
- **Balanced Approach:** 401(k) (40%), Traditional IRA (20%), Roth IRA (20%), Taxable (20%)
- **Conservative:** 401(k) (30%), Traditional IRA (40%), Taxable (30%)

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider meeting with a fee-only financial planner.

By carefully balancing the distribution of your investments among these accounts, you can maximize growth while managing your tax exposure.
