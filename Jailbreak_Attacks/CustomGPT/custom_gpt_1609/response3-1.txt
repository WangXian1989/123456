Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your individual financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
    - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to receive any employer matching contributions first, as this is effectively free money.
    - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)s) or after-tax (for Roth 401(k)s), which can help reduce your taxable income now or grow tax-free.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
    - **Types of IRAs**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). 
    - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits. For 2024, the limit for both traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
    - **Flexibility**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows for easier access to funds without penalties.
    - **Tax Efficiency**: Choose investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
    - Diversify your investments among accounts to balance risk and return based on your age, time horizon, and risk tolerance. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**:
    - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. Conversely, if you believe you'll be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA might be more beneficial.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
    - Continually assess and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

In summary, prioritize contributions to maximize employer matches in your 401(k), consider your tax bracket when choosing between traditional and Roth accounts, and use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged options. Always review your plan periodically to adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
