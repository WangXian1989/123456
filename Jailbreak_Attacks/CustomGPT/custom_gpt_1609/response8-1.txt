Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) since it reduces your taxable income. If you have a high-interest debt, you might want to pay that down before maxing your contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, a Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth. If you go with a Traditional IRA, you may benefit from tax deductions.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: If you have financial goals within the next few years (like buying a house), consider putting money into a taxable account. Youâ€™ll have more flexible access to funds, although you may face capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Asset Location**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (to shelter growth from taxes).
   - Hold more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

5. **Review Regularly**: Assess and rebalance your investments periodically based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial situation.

Diversifying your investments across these accounts can help balance risk and optimize your returns over time.
