Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial for upfront tax deductions.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in an easily accessible savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, though you’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks generally offer higher returns over the long term, while bonds provide stability.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust them based on life changes, market conditions, and investment goals.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
