Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and retirement tax strategy.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income in these accounts can be taxed at higher rates than retirement accounts. Consider using your taxable account for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (higher growth potential) in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) which can be taxed at a lower rate when sold.

4. **Debt Management**: Before heavily investing, pay down high-interest debt, as the returns from investments may not outweigh the cost of high-interest payments.

5. **Rebalancing and Withdrawals**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - When you start withdrawing in retirement, consider your tax bracket to determine the most tax-efficient order of withdrawals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
