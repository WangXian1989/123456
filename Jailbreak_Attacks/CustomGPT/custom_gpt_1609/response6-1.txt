To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for short-term goals or after-tax savings, keeping potential tax implications in mind.

### 2. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account.
   - Maintain a mix of aggressive and conservative investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for each type of account ($22,500 for 401(k) in 2024; $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions for those over 50).

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement considering tax implications (withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts).

### 5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your evolving financial goals.

By strategically allocating funds among these accounts considering their tax implications and growth potential, you can optimize your long-term savings. Always consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific needs.
