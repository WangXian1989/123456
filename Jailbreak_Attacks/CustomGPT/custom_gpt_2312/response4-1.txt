Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as it's essentially free money. After that, aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA accounts for long-term growth to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for investing in assets that may not generate immediate taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, to limit capital gains taxes.

3. **Set Investment Goals**:
   - If you have long-term goals (retirement), prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For medium-term goals (buying a home, starting a business), taxable accounts may be appropriate.
   - Consider your risk tolerance; younger investors might lean more heavily towards stock investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts can hold various asset types (stocks, bonds, cash) to align with your overall investment strategy.

5. **Annual Review**:
   - Reassess your distribution strategy regularly to adjust for changes in income, regulations, or personal goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
