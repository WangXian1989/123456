Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**  
   - Take full advantage of any employer matches; it’s free money.
   - Contribute enough to reach the maximum limit if possible.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**  
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits.
   - Aim to contribute up to the IRA limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**  
   - Once you max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider contributing to a taxable account.
   - This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making it useful for short- to medium-term financial goals.

4. **Asset Allocation:**  
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and those with higher tax burdens (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**  
   - Adjust your allocations according to your risk tolerance and market conditions.

6. **Tax Considerations:**  
   - Keep tax implications in mind. Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts are taxed as ordinary income.

Consulting a financial advisor can help personalize this strategy based on your unique circumstances.
