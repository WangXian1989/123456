3. **Peer Influencers**: Collaborate with influencers or community leaders who are relatable to this demographic. Peer-to-peer communication can significantly increase engagement.

4. **Interactive Content**: Use polls, quizzes, and interactive posts to engage them. This not only attracts attention but also fosters a sense of community.

5. **Simplify Registration and Voting**: Provide clear information on how to register and vote. Consider creating user-friendly guides or apps to assist with the voting process.
