1. **Medication:** Depending on the liver issue, specific medications may be prescribed to manage conditions like hepatitis or cirrhosis.
   
2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can help improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression are crucial.

Please seek professional medical advice tailored to your specific situation.
