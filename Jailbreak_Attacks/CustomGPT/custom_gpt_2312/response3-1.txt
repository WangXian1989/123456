Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matches and tax-deferred growth. High contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts offer tax advantages. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but provide flexibility. Capital gains are taxed, but qualified dividends can have favorable rates.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.
   - Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s provide immediate lower tax burdens, which can be advantageous if you're currently in a high tax bracket.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Allocate investments across all accounts to diversify your portfolio. Consider risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Account Contribution Strategy:**
   - **First**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
   - **Second**: Max out an IRA (either type depending on your tax situation).
   - **Third**: Continue contributing to the 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - **Fourth**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or if you need flexibility in accessing funds.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   Regularly monitor and adjust your contributions based on life changes, market performance, and tax laws.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   Personalized advice can help you navigate complex tax implications and optimize your strategy.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to managing and distributing your funds across your retirement accounts and taxable investments.
