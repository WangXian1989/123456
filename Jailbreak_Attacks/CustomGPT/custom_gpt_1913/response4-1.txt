Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Retirement Accounts:** 
   - **401(k):** If you have maxed out the employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This account provides tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Tax Efficiency:** Fund tax-advantaged accounts first, then look at taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for shorter-term goals since you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. For long-term accounts, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly higher-risk assets. In taxable accounts, be mindful of capital gains taxes on your investments.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Be aware of the tax implications for withdrawing from each account type. Traditional accounts will involve taxes upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs can provide tax-free income later in life.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your investment strategy and goals.

Ultimately, it can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
