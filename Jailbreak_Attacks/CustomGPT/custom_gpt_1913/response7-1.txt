To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key principles:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, but withdrawals are taxed. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains and income from investments are taxed annually. This is where you may want to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for lower tax rates.

2. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Align your distribution with short-term and long-term financial goals. For example:
     - Use your 401(k) and IRA primarily for retirement savings.
     - Utilize taxable accounts for goals that are five years or sooner.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is balanced across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

4. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your employer's 401(k), especially if they match contributions, as this is free money. After maximizing the match, consider the IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: 
   - Periodically assess your distribution strategy based on changes in tax laws, personal circumstances, and investment performance.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
