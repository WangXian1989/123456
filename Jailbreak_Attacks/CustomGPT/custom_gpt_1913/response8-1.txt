Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: Once you've funded your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit. If you are over 50, consider catch-up contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use any remaining funds for taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, consider diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement may prefer more conservative investments.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly reassess your financial situation and goals, adjusting contributions and allocation as necessary.
