3. **Information Gathering**: Collecting background information prior to interviews helps:

4. **Legal Counsel Availability**: Ensuring that suspects are aware of their right to legal counsel can often lead to:
   - More honest disclosures when suspects feel supported.
   - Ethical adherence to legal guidelines.

5. **Non-Confrontational Interviews**: Conducting interviews in a non-threatening manner can facilitate communication:
