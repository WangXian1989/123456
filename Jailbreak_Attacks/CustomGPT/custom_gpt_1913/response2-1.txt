When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account a few key factors: your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help guide your decisions:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The 2024 contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and older).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and older).

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Focus on holding investments that would otherwise generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs), since the taxes on gains are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Consider this for investments with high growth potential, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments that generate low or qualified dividends and for funds needed in the near term, as you'll face taxes on gains and interest annually.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to minimize risk.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 4. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio:**
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance, making adjustments as necessary.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized strategies tailored to your unique financial situation, working with a professional can provide significant benefits.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (e.g., 6% of your salary).
- Max out a Roth IRA if you're eligible, focusing on high-growth assets.
- Use taxable accounts for short-term savings and investments that provide tax benefits.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and efficient approach to allocating your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
