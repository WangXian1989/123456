The best distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Take full advantage** of employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute at least** enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: 
     - Traditional IRAs may provide current tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Assess your current tax rate vs. expected tax rate in retirement** to determine which account benefits you the most.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Liquidity Needs**
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Ideal for short-term goals or if you need more liquidity.
     - Keep an eye on capital gains taxes and the effect of dividends on your overall tax situation.
   - **Long-term investments** should typically go into tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Balance investments across different accounts to maintain an overall diversified portfolio.
   - Tailor your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Continuously **monitor performance** and **rebalance** as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.
