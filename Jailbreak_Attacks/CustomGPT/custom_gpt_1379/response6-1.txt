To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to meet any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions if eligible (traditional or Roth based on your income and tax situation).

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Short-term goals (1-3 years): Favor liquidity, consider taxable accounts.
   - Long-term goals (5+ years): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for growth.

### 3. **Diversification Strategies**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers limited investment choices; focus on diversified funds.
   - **IRA**: Broader investment options, consider individual stocks, bonds, or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may create capital gains tax (e.g., high-dividend stocks), while being mindful of tax implications.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy in retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### Summary
- **Maximize employer match** in 401(k).
- **Max out IRA contributions** if possible.
- **Diversify investments** based on account type and objectives.
- Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impact.

By balancing these factors, you can optimize your overall investment strategy.
