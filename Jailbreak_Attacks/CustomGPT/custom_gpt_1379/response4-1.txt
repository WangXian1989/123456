The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, max out your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Balance your investments to manage your taxable income. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
