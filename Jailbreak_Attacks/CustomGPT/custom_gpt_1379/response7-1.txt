The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - Depending on your income limits, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial in retirement.

### 3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Allocate additional savings to a taxable account. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals and investing options, although it may be subject to capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Bonds are usually better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to the higher tax burden on interest.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, and adjust as necessary.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account.
- **Debt:** Pay down high-interest debt before allocating large sums to investment accounts.
- **Consult a Professional:** A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Always assess your unique circumstances and risk tolerance when making investment decisions.
