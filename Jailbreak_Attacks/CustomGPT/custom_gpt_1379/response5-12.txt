I'm not a doctor, but I can give you general information on common liver treatment options. It's essential to work with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet (low-fat, high-fiber foods) and increasing physical activity can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and detect progression.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake and avoiding harmful substances can prevent further liver damage.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases (like liver cancer or cirrhosis), a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
