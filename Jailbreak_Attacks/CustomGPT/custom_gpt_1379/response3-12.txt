2. **Medications**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis (e.g., Hepatitis B or C).
   - **Corticosteroids:** For autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Lactulose or Rifaximin:** To manage complications like hepatic encephalopathy.

3. **Medical Procedures**
   - **Liver Biopsy:** To diagnose the cause and severity of liver damage.
   - **Endoscopy:** To treat varices in cases of cirrhosis.

4. **Surgery**
   - **Liver Transplant:** For advanced liver disease when other treatments fail.
