To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially "free" money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs may offer upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts for flexibility. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented mutual funds or ETFs, as you won't access these funds until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, either prioritize traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) contributions.
   - **Taxable**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, benefiting from lower tax rates.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Evaluate your current and future tax situations to determine whether to prioritize pre-tax (401(k) or traditional IRA) or after-tax (Roth IRA or taxable) contributions.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
