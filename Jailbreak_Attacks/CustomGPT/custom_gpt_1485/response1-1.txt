Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts first. After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income during retirement. Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met. Taxable accounts may be taxed on capital gains and dividends, so consider these implications when planning your withdrawals.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Over time, your asset allocation may shift due to market movements. Rebalance your accounts periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: As you near retirement, consider how you'll withdraw funds from each account type to minimize taxes and meet your income needs.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
