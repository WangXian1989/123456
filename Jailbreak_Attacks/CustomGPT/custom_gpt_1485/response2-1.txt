When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have an employer match, contribute the amount necessary to get the full match first.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - If you have maxed out the contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider contributing to a taxable account.
   - The contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA are often lower than what you can invest, so you might want to balance your contributions based on your overall investment strategy.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Generally, it’s beneficial to place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer or avoid taxes on growth.
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments that produce lower taxable income, such as qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes in all accounts.

6. **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors may take more risks with their 401(k) and IRA investments, while those closer to retirement may prefer safer investments to preserve capital.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice is always beneficial as they can provide insights based on your specific financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy for distributing your money across your retirement and taxable accounts.
