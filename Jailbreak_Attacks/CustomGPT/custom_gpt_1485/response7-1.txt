Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of common strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the maximum match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA over taxable accounts. If you have the option, go for a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversification of Tax Treatment**: Consider tax diversification by contributing to both a traditional 401(k) (pre-tax) and a Roth IRA (after-tax). This gives you flexibility in retirement regarding tax withdrawals.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you plan to withdraw money in retirement. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalty and may have favorable capital gains rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, adhere to an appropriate investment strategy that matches your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly reassess your investment allocation and retirement strategy to ensure it aligns with any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Ultimately, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
