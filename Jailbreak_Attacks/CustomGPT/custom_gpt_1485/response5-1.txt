(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A general approach could be:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

It's wise to regularly review your allocations and adjust based on your investment performance and life changes.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! Distributing your cash can be a bit of a juggling act, but hereâ€™s a plan to get you rolling like a financial wizard:

1. **401(k) Goldmine**: First things first, max out that employer match! Itâ€™s free money, like a bonus level in a video game. If they're offering a 50% match on your contributions, youâ€™d be a fool to leave that on the table.
   
2. **IRA Brilliance**: Next up, consider diving into your IRA. If you can swing a Roth IRA, do it! Think of it as tax-free growth for lifeâ€”who doesnâ€™t love a tax-free party in retirement? Just remember to check the income limits because no one likes an unwelcome party crasher.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've milked the tax-deferred cows dry, hit that taxable account for more investments. Just be smart about your choicesâ€”look for low-turnover funds to keep those pesky capital gains in check.

Remember to keep an eye on this action plan and adjust your strategy as you level up through lifeâ€™s game! Money doesn't solve everything, but it sure makes the journey a lot smoother.
