When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. However, distributions in retirement are taxable.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider the tax implications of selling any assets.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, as of 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k), with an additional catch-up contribution if you're over 50. IRA contributions are capped at $6,500, with similar catch-up provisions.

3. **Retirement Timeline**: 
   - If you are closer to retirement, prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits. If you're younger, you might allocate more to taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Investment Options**:
   - 401(k)s often have limited investment choices. If your 401(k) has high fees or poor investment options, you might invest less there compared to an IRA or taxable account where you can choose lower-cost index funds or ETFs.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Have a strategy for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it is recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first for flexibility, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts if you have a Roth IRA.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a highly liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

7. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate risk.

8. **Professional Advice**: 
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This balanced approach helps in optimizing your tax situation, ensuring you have access to funds when needed, and preparing for retirement effectively.
