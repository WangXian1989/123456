To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred. This setup is beneficial for your taxable income reduction.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments. Use this for short-term goals or investments that might generate high taxable income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth, especially if your employer matches contributions to your 401(k).
   - Use taxable accounts for liquidity or investment strategies involving stocks that you might want to sell within a year.

3. **Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Assess your risk tolerance and diversify your investments across these accounts accordingly. Generally, you might want stocks in growth-oriented accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Annual Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRAs to optimize tax advantages. In 2023, the limit for employee contributions to a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if over 50).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw from each account in retirement. Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can affect your taxable income, so consider the order of withdrawals to minimize your tax burden.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations in each account to ensure alignment with your financial goals, especially after significant market changes.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation and goals.
