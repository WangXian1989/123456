I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for your liver problem. Treatment can vary greatly depending on the specific liver issue you are facing, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, or others. Possible treatment options might include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures. Be sure to get personalized advice from a medical expert.
