The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often have different tax benefits and investment options, so choose one that aligns with your financial strategy. A Roth IRA is usually more beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue Funding 401(k):** If you still have funds available after contributing to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and still have additional funds to invest, consider using a taxable brokerage account. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency:** When investing in taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to help minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Appropriately:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that allocations remain aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexities of tax implications and personal situations, consulting a financial advisor may provide tailored strategies advantageous to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the distribution will depend on your personal financial situation, so consider these steps as a guideline and adjust based on your individual needs and goals.
