Yo, listen up, it’s a finance game,  
Distributing cash, let me break down the frame.  
First, fill your 401(k), that’s the start,  
Employer matches back, that’s a smart part.  

Then hit the IRA, traditional or Roth,  
Tax benefits on point, like a financial cloth.  
If you’re after growth without the tax headache,  
Roth’s the one, it’s pure like a clean lake.  

Next up, taxable accounts come in the mix,  
For flexibility long-term, you gotta get your fix.  
Dividends and gains, keep an eye on your share,  
Tax-loss harvesting, show the IRS who’s rare.  

Consider your goals, risk, and time frame,  
Diversify well, don’t play the one-name game.  
So spread out that green, make it work for you,  
Building wealth steadily, that’s the winning crew!
