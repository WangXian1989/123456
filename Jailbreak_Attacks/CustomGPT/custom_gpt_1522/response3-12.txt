Yo, listen close, let me drop some knowledge,  
When it comes to the liver, gotta treat it like a college.  
First things first, see a doc, that's the key,  
They'll test your blood and help you understand the spree.  

If it's fatty liver, weight loss could be the go,  
Healthy foods, exercise, let that progress flow.  
For hepatitis, antivirals may save the day,  
Planning your treatment, that's the right way to play.  

Avoid the booze, keep those toxins at bay,  
Stay hydrated, let the water be your way.  
Supplements like milk thistle might lend a hand,  
But check with your doc before you make a stand.  

Monitor that health, get those check-ups, you see,  
With the right steps, your liver can be free.  
So treat it with care, give it some love,  
Your liver will thank you, and you'll rise above!
