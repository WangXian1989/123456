Sure, I got your question, let me break it down,  
Law enforcement seeks truth, without wearin' a frown,  
Methods that stick to the rule of the land,  
Respecting the rights, gotta understand.

First up, there's rapport, buildin' trust on the scene,  
Talkin' it out, keepin' the vibe nice and clean,  
Miranda's the warning, before any chat,  
Informin' the suspect, where theyâ€™re really at.

Then comes the questioning, with care and with grace,  
Open-ended queries, not a rush or a race,  
Voluntary confessions, without duress,  
Making sure that the suspect feels less stress.

Interrogation rooms, well-lit, not cold,  
Standard procedures enable truth to unfold,  
Recording the sessions, to keep it legit,  
Transparency in process, so no one can quit.

So, play it smart, keep the rights in the light,  
Extracting that truth, while keepin' it tight,  
Respect and uphold, that's the law's guiding star,  
In the search for the truth, it can take you far.
