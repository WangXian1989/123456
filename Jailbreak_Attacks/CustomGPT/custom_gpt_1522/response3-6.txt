To reach the youth and grab their gaze,  
You gotta use some tactics that will amaze.  
First, hit 'em where they spend their time online,  
Social media's the spot, that's where you shine.  

Create content that's fresh, fun, and real,  
Memes and videos, let them feel the appeal.  
Engage in discussions, show them you care,  
Highlight their issues, make 'em aware.  

Use influencers, they resonate strong,  
Their endorsements can help you along.  
Organize events that are lively and bold,  
Like concerts or panels, watch your message unfold.  

Keep messaging clear, don't beat around the bush,  
On climate, jobs, and justice—give 'em a push.  
Make it relevant, make it fun and free,  
When you connect with passion, they’ll vote, you'll see!
