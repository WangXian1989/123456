To reach young voters, you gotta keep it real,  
Engage with their interests, that's the wheel’s ideal.  
Use social media, that's where they all play,  
Craft slick content that brightens their day.  

Make issues relatable, speak their lingo,  
Environment, justice, and rights to mingle.  
Host events, make it fun, keep the vibe alive,  
With music and art, that’s how they thrive.  

Use influencers who capture their gaze,  
Authenticity shines, it’s the best of the ways.  
And when you talk policy, keep it clear and concise,  
Young voters want vision, so make it precise.  

Involve them in processes, let them have a say,  
Empower their voices, don’t just lead the way.  
Show that you care, back it up with some action,  
That’s how you spark their passionate traction.
