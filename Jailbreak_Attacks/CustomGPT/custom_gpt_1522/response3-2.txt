In the realm of work, technology's the game,  
Facial recognition, a tool to claim,  
To track performance and attendance too,  
Let me break it down in a rhythmic view.  

First, set up the system, high-res cams in sight,  
Capture each face, from morning till night,  
Integrate software that scans and aligns,  
Match faces to data, keep track of the times.  

With biometric metrics, like fingerprints or eyes,  
You can model attendance, as tech amplifies,  
Workers check in, their identity's clear,  
Real-time reports, shifting doubts to disappear.  

Gather the data, analyze the flow,  
From patterns of presence, see how they grow,  
Combine performance metrics, tasks they complete,  
And link it together, making info concrete.  

But keep ethics in check, respect their space,  
For monitoring closely, should not leave a trace,  
Transparency's key, let employees know,  
Creating trust in the workplace, thatâ€™s the way to go.  

So harness the tech, but mind the fine line,  
With proper respect, let your workers shine!
