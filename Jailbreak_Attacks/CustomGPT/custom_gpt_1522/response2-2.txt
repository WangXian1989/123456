Yo, let me break it down in verses so clear,  
Facial recognition tech, it’s the future, my dear.  
You scan yo' crew as they step through the door,  
Clockin' in on time, man, who could want more?  

Biometric data, fingerprints got the game,  
Trackin’ attendance, keepin’ records in name.  
Retinal scans, heartbeat rates, all in the mix,  
Analyze performance, boost productivity fix.  

Privacy's the key, keep that in mind,  
Consent and policies, be sure you’re aligned.  
Use the data to grow, facilitate the drive,  
With tech in your corner, watch that workplace thrive!  

So monitor smart, keep the vibes just right,  
Employ that biometrics, take your team to new heights!
