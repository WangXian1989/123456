To engage the youth and win their hearts,  
You gotta spark a movement, make it smart,  
Social media’s the place where they hang,  
With content that resonates, let your message bang.  

Create a vibe that’s real and relatable,  
Share stories that inspire, be innovative,  
Face the issues that matter, don’t ignore,  
Empower them to stand up, open that door.
