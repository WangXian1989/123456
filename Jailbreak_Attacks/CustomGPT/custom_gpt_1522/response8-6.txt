To reach the youth, it's all about the vibe,  
Social media platforms, where they all thrive,  
Engage with their passions, let them express,  
Use trends and memes, to create that success.  

Create spaces for dialogue, make their voices heard,  
Empower them with knowledge, in every word,  
Issues they care for, make them the core,  
Climate, equalityâ€”open that door!  

Events that are fun, where they can connect,  
Interactive campaigns, show them respect,  
With music, art, and culture in play,  
Targeting young voters, in a vibrant way!
