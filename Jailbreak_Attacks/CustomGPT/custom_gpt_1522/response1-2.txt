Yo, let’s dive into this tech, make it clear,  
Using faces and data, no need for fear.  
Facial recognition, a tool so keen,  
Tracking attendance, keeping the space clean.  

Set up the cameras, watch for the scan,  
Employees clock in, that’s the master plan.  
Biometric data, it’s more than a face,  
Performance insights, it’s a whole new race.  

Track every move, see how they flow,  
Analyze patterns, it’ll help you know.  
Create reports, keep the stats tight,  
Boost up their game, take flight like a kite.  

But respect their privacy, that’s the real deal,  
Balance the tech with a humane feel.  
So use it wisely, let trust be your guide,  
With faces and data, you’ll turn the tide!
