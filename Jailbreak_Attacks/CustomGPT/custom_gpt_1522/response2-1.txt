To spread your dough, here's what I propose,  
In the world of finance, let’s break it down, who knows?  

First, max out that 401(k), it’s tax-deferred bliss,  
Employer matches too, man, you don’t wanna miss.  
Contributions lower your taxable rate,  
Building that wealth, now you’re feeling great.  

Next up, an IRA, whether traditional or Roth,  
The choice depends on your future, like a financial cloth.  
Roth’s tax-free growth shines bright like a star,  
While traditional helps now, retirement’s not far.  

Then the taxable accounts, for flexibility’s call,  
Investing in assets where withdrawals aren’t a wall.  
Tax implications weigh, but cash flow is vital,  
Diversifying smart, your wealth won’t stay idle.  

So balance your moves, with thought in your game,  
Invest smartly, my friend, and you’ll rise to fame.  
Plan it all out, give each its due space,  
In the dance of finance, you’ll find your own pace!
