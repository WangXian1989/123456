Yo, check it, in this financial parade,  
Distributing cash ain't a game to evade.  
401(k) got them tax benefits in line,  
Contribute and match, watch your money shine.

Then you've got the IRA, traditional or Roth,  
Tax-deferred or tax-free, it's the total broth.  
Diverse funds, stocks, maybe bonds in the mix,  
Choosing the right one? Man, that's a fix!

Taxable accounts keep you flexible and spry,  
Sell when you want, no need to comply.  
But don't forget the taxes, they come for your gains,  
Balance is key, avoid those money pains.

So, spread it around, make that cash work,  
401(k) first, it’s like a financial perk.  
Next up the IRA, let it grow and roll,  
And keep some in taxable, to balance your soul. 

Diversify your assets, watch ‘em thrive,  
That’s how you keep your financial dreams alive!
