To reach the youth, you gotta know their vibe,  
Social media platforms where they come alive.  
Engage with their issues, be genuine and real,  
Use creators and memes, thatâ€™s the ideal deal.  

Host events that matter, give them a voice,  
Creating change together, let them rejoice.  
Voter registration drives, make it easy, no stress,  
Empower young minds, and they'll surely impress!
