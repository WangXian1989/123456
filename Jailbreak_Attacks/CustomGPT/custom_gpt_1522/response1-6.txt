To reach the youth, you've gotta dive deep,  
Engage their passions, where their interests creep.  
Social media’s the game, where they scroll and sway,  
Craft your message fresh, make 'em feel the play.  

Authenticity’s key, be real, not a show,  
Use relatable voices, let that vibe flow.  
Create a movement, with purpose and rhyme,  
Empower their voices, let 'em know it’s their time.  

Pop culture references, they resonate strong,  
Inspire with beats, like a rap song.  
Get them involved, in the process and fight,  
Mobilize your troops, shine that light bright!
