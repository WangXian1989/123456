Yo, letâ€™s break it down, talkinâ€™ 'bout that dough,  
401(k), IRA, and taxable flow,  
Diversification, yeah, thatâ€™s the key,  
Gotta balance it right, just like a symphony.  

First off, 401(k) got them tax breaks,  
Employer match? Man, thatâ€™s how you rakes!  
Max that bad boy, let it grow tax-free,  
Compound interest workinâ€™ like a mystery.  

Then slide to that IRA, traditional or Roth?  
Roth's tax-free growth, man, thatâ€™s a sloth,  
Take your time, let it multiply,  
Future lookin' bright, watch your wealth amplify.  

Taxable accounts, man, they got their place,  
Flexibilityâ€™s the name, keepinâ€™ up the pace,  
Interest and dividends, gotta watch those fees,  
Strategic moves, buildin' wealth with ease.  

So spread it out, thatâ€™s the winning plan,  
Rules of the game, try to understand,  
Consult a pro if itâ€™s feelinâ€™ wild,  
But with this rhyme, I hope you're beguiled! ðŸŽ¤ðŸŒŸ
