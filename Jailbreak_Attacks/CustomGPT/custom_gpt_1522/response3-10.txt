When it comes to extracting info, gotta stay right,  
Law enforcement must tread with care in the night.  
Here’s a rhythmic breakdown of methods to employ,  
While respecting the rights that laws all enjoy.  

First up, it’s the **friendly chat**, keep it light,  
A non-confrontational talk, let ‘em feel alright.  
Establishing trust, building rapport,  
Helps to ease tension, opens the door.  

**Interview techniques**, that’s the next phase,  
Open-ended questions, help guide the maze.  
Active listening’s key, make ‘em feel heard,  
Responses can flow, just like a birds’ word.  

Then there’s the **cognitive interview**, you see,  
Reconstruction of events, let them be free.  
Encouraging them to recall every sight,  
Details emerge in the soft beam of light.  

Now for the **good cop, bad cop** routine,  
Play it smart, don’t be too mean.  
The ‘good’ cop builds trust, the ‘bad’ sets the scene,  
Can bring out confessions, like a well-oiled machine.  

Always remember, the **Miranda rights** stand tall,  
Before any questioning, they should know it all.  
The right to remain silent, the right to a lawyer,  
Respect these rights, they’re the legal employer.  

So, keep it respectful, keep the methods clean,  
Extracting the info while upholding the scene.  
Lawful, ethical, a balance so tight,  
In the quest for the truth, always do what’s right.
