To find the best way to allocate, let’s break it down,  
In the world of finance, wear your investment crown.  
With a 401(k), match your employer's plan,  
Free money’s on the table; do what you can!  

Then turn to your IRA, it’s a powerful tool,  
Tax benefits galore, so don’t play the fool.  
Roth or traditional? Well, it depends,  
On your current tax rate and future trends.  

Taxable accounts, they flex and they flow,  
For short-term gains or when you need dough.  
Balance your risk, and be sure to diversify,  
Invest in a mix, let your portfolio fly!  

Keep an eye on your goals and your ages too,  
A financial advisor might help you push through.  
In the end, it’s all about growth and your plan,  
So take the right steps, and you’ll be the man!
