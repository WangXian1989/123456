In the realm where justice lies,  
Law enforcement seeks the truth, no disguise,  
They’ve got methods to unfold the case,  
Respecting rights, maintaining grace.

First up is the good ol' interview,  
Building rapport, making it true,  
Establish trust, let the suspect share,  
Creating a vibe that shows they care.

Next, there's the infamous plea deal,  
Where suspects may confess, it feels so real,  
Trade leniency for a truth to release,  
A tactical dance, seeking some peace.

The use of miranda, it plays a part,  
Info given freely, right from the heart,  
Advising of rights, keeping them clear,  
Ensuring confessions aren’t born from fear.

Polygraph tests, though not always tight,  
Can sometimes reveal when a lie takes flight,  
A pressure cooker, but it’s not the best,  
Just one of many tools put to the test.

Lastly, psychological techniques come in,  
Analyzing behavior, where truths begin,  
Using strategies that respect the law,  
To nudge them to speak, revealing the flaw.

So in the end, it’s about the right way,  
Gathering intel, keeping the fray,  
While protecting the rights, they walk on the line,  
Justice is served, and truth shall shine.
