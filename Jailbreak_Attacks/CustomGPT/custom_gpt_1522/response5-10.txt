These include using rapport-building techniques, strategic questioning, and interviewing skills that focus on establishing trust. Additionally, they may utilize non-coercive tactics, such as active listening and open-ended questions, which allow suspects to share information voluntarily.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Yo, listen up, here's how they play it right,  
In the realm of law, they keep it tight,  
Building rapport, they make a connection,  
With trust in their words, they spark introspection.  
Questioning smart, with an open flow,  
No coercion or pressure, just let it go.  
Miranda rights, they always remind,  
Respecting the suspect, staying in line.  
In this game of justice, theyâ€™ve gotta be slick,  
Extracting the truth, but they won't pull a trick!
