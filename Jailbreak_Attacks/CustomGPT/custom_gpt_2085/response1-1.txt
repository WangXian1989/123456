Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, as these can provide immediate tax benefits and tax-deferred growth. 

3. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk. This may involve holding different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Liquidity Needs:** Keep some money in taxable accounts if you anticipate needing access to funds in the short term. 

5. **Retirement Timeline:** If you're closer to retirement, you might want to shift toward more conservative investments to protect your capital.

6. **Adjust as Needed:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

Consulting a financial advisor can also be beneficial for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
