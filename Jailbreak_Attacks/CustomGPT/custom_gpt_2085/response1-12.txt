I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options that are often considered for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** This includes adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and monitoring of liver function tests can help track the progress of the condition.

4. **Viral Hepatitis Treatment:** If the liver issue is due to viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be effective.

5. **Intervention Procedures:** For certain conditions, procedures such as endoscopy or surgery might be required.

6. **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
