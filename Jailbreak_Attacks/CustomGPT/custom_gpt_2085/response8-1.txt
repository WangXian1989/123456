To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following general guidelines for allocating funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds to other accounts.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Max out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility. Contributions to these accounts can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, making them a higher priority.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** 
   - **401(k):** Traditional contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** With a Traditional IRA, contributions are often tax-deductible, whereas Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are taxed annually on interest and dividends, and capital gains are taxed when assets are sold. These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals but less tax-efficient.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified investment portfolio based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly revisit and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation is often beneficial.
