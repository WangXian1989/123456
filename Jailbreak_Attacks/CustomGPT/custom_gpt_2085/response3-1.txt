Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Ideal for higher-income individuals looking to lower taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or tax-free upon withdrawal. Evaluate your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not provide tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals. They can be a good option for funds you may need before retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) can afford to take on more risk since the investments can grow tax-deferred for many years, whereas taxable accounts should be balanced to manage taxes on capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Consider having an emergency fund in a separate savings account to avoid dipping into your investments during unforeseen circumstances.

5. **Diversification**: Invest in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all types of accounts to spread risk.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation and goals.
