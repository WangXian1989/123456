3. **Community Engagement**: Organize events or initiatives in local communities that allow young voters to participate and voice their concerns.

4. **Peer Influence**: Leverage influencers and young activists who can authentically connect with their peers and spread your message.

5. **Interactive Content**: Use polls, quizzes, and engaging visuals to capture attention and encourage interaction.
