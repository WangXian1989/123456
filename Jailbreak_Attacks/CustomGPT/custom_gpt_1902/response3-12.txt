I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Generally, treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit medications that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Treat underlying conditions (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis, steroids for autoimmune liver disease).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some find benefits from supplements (like milk thistle), but consult a healthcare provider first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatments.
