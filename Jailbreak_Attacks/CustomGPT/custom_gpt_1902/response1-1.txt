Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Max out employer match first (it's free money!).
   - If you can, contribute up to the annual limit for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - After maxing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA.
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth, making it a great choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may need to be accessed earlier or if you want more flexibility.
   - Favor tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impacts.

### General Strategy
- **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRAs for tax advantages.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversified across all accounts to manage risk.

Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changing goals!
