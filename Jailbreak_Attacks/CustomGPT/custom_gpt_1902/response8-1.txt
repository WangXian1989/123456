To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: Choose between Traditional or Roth IRAs depending on your income and tax implications.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need in the short term or for investing in assets that might generate lower tax burdens (like long-term capital gains).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment goals and risk tolerance. Stock-heavy investments may be better suited for accounts with longer time horizons (like 401(k) and IRAs), while bonds may be better in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Invest tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and your changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to your investments.
