Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for long-term capital gains (lower tax rates).

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth. Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) to manage capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - Longer horizons may favor riskier, higher-return investments. For shorter-term goals, prioritize stability.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Always consider your overall financial plan and long-term objectives when making decisions.
