Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as they offer tax benefits. Try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider a traditional IRA if you want tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement (assuming you meet the requirements).

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s ($30,000 if over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if over 50). Adjust your allocations accordingly.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Distributing funds into a Roth account can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. On the other hand, traditional accounts might be better if you want to lower your taxable income now.

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Asset allocation can differ based on the account type. For tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) to benefit from tax deferral. In taxable accounts, place investments with lower tax consequences, like index funds or long-term capital gain securities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investment mix to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals or penalties.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the plan to your specific circumstances can provide personalized insights. Would you like to explore any specific aspect of this distribution strategy further?
