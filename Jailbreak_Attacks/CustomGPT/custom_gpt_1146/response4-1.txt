To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions up to that match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. This will reduce your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - After contributing to your 401(k), consider putting money into a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Stay informed about the income limits for IRA contributions, especially for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds) or for savings you may need in the short term, as these might not have the same tax advantages but offer liquidity.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover rates leading to fewer capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk and optimize tax efficiency. Stocks might be better in taxable accounts due to lower long-term capital gains tax rates, while bonds may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their interest income.
   
5. **Regular Review:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. 

6. **Consider Professional Advice:**
   - If youâ€™re uncertain, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies suited to your financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient distribution of your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
