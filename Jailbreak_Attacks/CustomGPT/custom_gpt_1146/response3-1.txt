The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure you are aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older). The limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are often made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income. In contrast, taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes when investments are sold at a profit.
   - Consider your current tax bracket and how it may change in the future. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (which allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or after-tax contributions may be beneficial.

3. **Employer Matching**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially “free money” and should be a priority.

4. **Investment Options**:
   - Look at the investment options available in each account. 401(k) plans may have limited choices compared with IRAs and taxable accounts. Consider directing funds toward accounts with more advantageous investment opportunities.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. This can be achieved through a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about how and when you plan to access the money. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties at any age, whereas withdrawing from retirement accounts before age 59½ may incur penalties unless specific conditions are met.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

As financial situations are unique to each individual, it may also be wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice that takes into account your specific circumstances.
