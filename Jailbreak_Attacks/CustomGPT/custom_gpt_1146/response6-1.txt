Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here is a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Tax Implications for Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as they are taxed differently than retirement accounts. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate different types of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

4. **Investment Strategies:**
   - Consider placing more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to allow for tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments that generate income, as you can control the timing of capital gains.

5. **Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Summary:
- **Employer Match:** Max out contributions to get full employer match in your 401(k).
- **Investment Choices:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for aggressive growth; taxable accounts for income-generating or conservative investments. 

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your personal circumstances.
