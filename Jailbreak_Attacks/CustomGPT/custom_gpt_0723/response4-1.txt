Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing enough to reach the maximum contribution limit if it fits within your budget.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Evaluate whether a Roth or traditional IRA is better for you based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - If possible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or long-term capital gain stocks.
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and allocate less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) to your retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified mix of asset classes across all accounts, considering overall risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - Adjust contributions based on your proximity to retirement. Shift to less risky investments (e.g., bonds) as you near retirement age.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reevaluate your distribution strategy regularly to ensure it aligns with changing financial goals and market conditions.
