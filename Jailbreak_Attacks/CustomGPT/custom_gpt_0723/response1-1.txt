To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-income potential or anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize contributions here.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for investments that may generate significant taxable income (like bonds or dividends) after maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Longer time frames can take on more risk, while shorter time frames may call for more conservative investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes to optimize potential returns and reduce risk.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor, especially if you have a complex financial situation.

This balanced approach helps maximize your investment growth while considering tax implications and retirement goals.
