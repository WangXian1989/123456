The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Impact**:
   - **401(k) and IRA (Traditional)**: Contributions are generally tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on them until you withdraw in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize these accounts.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider prioritizing Roth contributions if you believe your tax rate will increase or if you want tax-free income during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for short-term goals or after you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for more than a year.

3. **Investment Choices**: Different accounts often have different investment choices and fees. Consider the best investment options available in each account type.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts before directing all funds into retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications to maximize your money in retirement.
