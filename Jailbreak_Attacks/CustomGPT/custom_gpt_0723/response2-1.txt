Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (or both). For 2024, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) & IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. They can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on realized gains and dividends. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are less tax-efficient.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you have a wider range of investment options. Consider adding assets like real estate or foreign stocks.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - As your investments grow, ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. This may involve reallocating funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

### 5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**
   - If you are closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments. If you have a long time until retirement, you can typically afford to take on more risk.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible accountâ€”covering 3-6 months of living expenses is often recommended.

### Example Allocation
- **Early Career**: 50% 401(k), 30% IRA, 20% taxable.
- **Mid-Career**: 40% 401(k), 30% IRA, 30% taxable.
- **Pre-Retirement**: 30% 401(k), 30% IRA, 40% taxable to ensure flexibility.

Customizing your allocation according to your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and life situation is crucial. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice.
