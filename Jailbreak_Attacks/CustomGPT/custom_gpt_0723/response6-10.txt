Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: 
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship with the suspect can make them more willing to share information.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Asking open-ended questions can help the suspect recall details more vividly, leading to more information being shared.

2. **Legal Procedures**:
   - **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before questioning is crucial to uphold their constitutional protections.
   - **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to speak freely without coercion helps maintain legal and ethical standards.

By employing these methods, law enforcement can gather information effectively while adhering to constitutional rights.
