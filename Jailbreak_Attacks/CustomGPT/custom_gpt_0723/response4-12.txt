2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), different medications may be prescribed.
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and assess the progression of liver disease.

4. **Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, interventions such as liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always follow your doctor's advice for the most appropriate treatment plan for your situation.
