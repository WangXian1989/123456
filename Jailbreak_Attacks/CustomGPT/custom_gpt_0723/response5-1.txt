(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA after maxing out your 401(k) or if you're not eligible for a full contribution to your 401(k). IRAs typically have more investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts can go into a taxable brokerage account. This can be a good option for short-term goals or flexibility.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Also consider the tax implications of where you hold your investments. For instance, high-growth or high-dividend stocks might be better suited for tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio remains diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

1. **Claim That Match**: First off, if your 401(k) has an employer match, get that free money! Contribute up to the match level and then switch gears.

2. **Road to the IRA**: Once you've snagged that match, jump into an IRA (Roth or Traditional). If youâ€™re a Roth fan and eligible, go for it! Itâ€™s tax-free growth, baby! Otherwise, a Traditional IRA also rocks for tax deferment.

3. **Taxable Playground**: Once those tax-advantaged accounts are filled up, throw any extra cash into a taxable account. This gives you flexibility and access when you need it, just remember, taxes will hit differently here.

4. **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Be smart about where you put your investments. Keep those high-growth stocks or dividend payers in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize that tax bite.

5. **Balance It Out**: Finally, keep things diversified! Mix up those assets according to your risk style and life goals. Invest wisely, enjoy the journey, and let the cash flow!
