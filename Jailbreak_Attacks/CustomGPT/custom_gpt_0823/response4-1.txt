Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions here (up to $22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50). It reduces taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: If eligible (income limits apply), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (up to $6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, invest in a taxable account. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust based on changing goals or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
