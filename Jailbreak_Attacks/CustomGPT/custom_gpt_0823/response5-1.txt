Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) or investments you plan to hold long-term. Capital gains tax rates can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments (like stocks or long-term holdings) in taxable accounts and more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation annually to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically at retirement to minimize taxes. This might involve drawing first from taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of salary until matched.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible ($6,500 for 2023; additional $1,000 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Fund based on your investment goals after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific situation and goals. They can provide personalized advice based on your full financial picture.
