Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Traditional contributions lower your taxable income now, while Roth contributions allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), IRAs can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free in retirement). If you qualify for tax deductions on your traditional IRA contributions, it might be beneficial to prioritize this.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't offer tax advantages, but you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties. They may be suitable for short-term goals or if you've already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you’re diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account. Generally, 3-6 months of expenses is recommended.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: If you’re saving for retirement, maxing out your 401(k) and IRA (if eligible) is usually prioritized. For goals within 5 years, consider putting money in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.

6. **Review & Adjust**: Periodically review your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and market conditions.

It's often advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
