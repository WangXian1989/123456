Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s an overview of how to approach this:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to receive the full contribution. This is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute up to the annual limit: Try to contribute as much as you can, considering your budget and financial goals.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - Fully utilize IRAs: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth contributions can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Focus on tax efficiency: Use IRAs for investments with higher growth potential or those that generate significant income, as those can benefit from tax deferral.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Investments for flexibility: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments: In taxable accounts, focus on investments with lower turnover (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategy**: 
   - Emergency Fund: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before contributing heavily to investments.
   - Diversify: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.), adjusting based on your time horizon and risk tolerance.
   - Tax Implications: Pay attention to tax implications in each account type, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals, especially as you approach retirement.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual circumstances, as they can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
