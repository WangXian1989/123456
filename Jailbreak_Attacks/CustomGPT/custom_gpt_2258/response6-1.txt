Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially free money and crucial for long-term growth.
   - **High Contribution Limits:** Take advantage of the higher contribution limit (for 2023, it's $22,500 plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50).

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Determine if a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better for you based on current vs. future tax rates.
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Max Out Contributions:** The contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) for 2023.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Keep funds for short-term goals or emergencies since these accounts offer more liquidity without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (such as index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **Distribution Strategy:**
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Aim to max out 401(k) and IRA contributions first due to their tax advantages.
- **Debt Considerations:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before investing heavily.
- **Long-Term Growth:** Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you reach the limits of tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Conclusion:**
- **Personalize Your Approach:** Assess your risk tolerance, timeline, and financial goals.
- **Rebalance Periodically:** Review and adjust your allocations annually to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.
