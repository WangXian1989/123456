(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, as both can provide tax benefits depending on your income level and future tax expectations. Finally, use taxable accounts for additional investments once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. It's also important to maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.

First off, hammer that 401(k) like it owes you moneyâ€”especially if your employer's throwing in matching contributions; that's the free cash you don't want to ignore!
