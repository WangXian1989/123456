Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - **Tax Advantages:** 401(k) contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you will be in retirement, this is beneficial.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now but taxes you upon withdrawal.
   - **Flexibility:** IRAs generally have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s, allowing for more tailored investment strategies.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Post-Tax Savings:** Use these for investments that you might need access to before retirement or for goals outside of retirement. Capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed differently, often more favorably on long-term gains.
   - **Diversification:** Taxable accounts can be used for investments that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Growth vs. Income:** Consider what each account is meant for. 401(k) and IRA accounts are generally better for growth-focused investments (like stocks) since the tax advantages are significant. Keep more stable, income-producing investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from preferential tax treatment on long-term gains and dividends.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and rebalance your asset allocation periodically based on market performance and your changing risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications:**
   - Think about your current and expected future income levels, as this will influence the effectiveness of tax-deferred versus taxable investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It's often beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial advisor who understands your overall financial picture and can help optimize your investment distribution.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so adjust this framework according to your specific circumstances and goals.
