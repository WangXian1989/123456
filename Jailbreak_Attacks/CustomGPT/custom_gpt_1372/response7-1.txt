When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy generally involves considering a few key factors: your current tax situation, your retirement timeline, investment options, and your overall financial goals. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to ensure you're receiving the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After you have secured your employer's match, consider maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility. These accounts offer tax benefits either now (traditional) or in retirement (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can then focus on investing in your taxable accounts. This is where you might want to invest in assets that generate low capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk better. Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) and align them with your overall portfolio strategy.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Timing**: Think about when you might need to access these funds. Generally, 401(k) and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts do not.

6. **Roth Options**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Lastly, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and circumstances.

Ultimately, the optimal distribution will depend on your unique financial situation and retirement goals.
