The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial depending on your income levels now and in retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions Between Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider how much to contribute to each account. Depending on your tax situation, you might prefer to prioritize:
     - **401(k)** for higher contribution limits and employer matching.
     - **IRA** for tax advantages and more investment options.
     - **Taxable accounts** for flexibility in withdrawals and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Accounts with tax advantages (like 401(k)s and IRAs) are preferable for long-term investments because they allow your money to grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - Taxable accounts may be utilized for shorter-term investments or if you anticipate needing liquidity.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that the investment choices you make in each account align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As investments grow and market conditions change, it’s important to review and rebalance your accounts to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial goals and circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will reflect your personal financial priorities and retirement plans.
