When determining the best way to distribute your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Contributions to these accounts may lower your taxable income, and investments within them grow tax-deferred. These are best for longer-term investments.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed in the year they are realized. Suitable for shorter-term goals or if you need liquidity.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth. Consider a higher risk tolerance with a more aggressive asset allocation (e.g., more stocks).
   - **Taxable Account**: This could include more stable investments or bonds, as you may need these funds sooner.

3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first if possible, especially if your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k).

4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Generally speaking, for retirement, it's advisable to withdraw money from taxable accounts first in early retirement, followed by tax-deferred accounts, with Roth IRAs being last due to tax advantages.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for the specific tax implications and goals of each account.

Every individual's financial situation is unique, and it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs and goals.
