(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plan. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Consider tax implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are often tax-deductible, whereas withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income. In contrast, Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later.
3. **Focus on investment growth**: Allocate funds based on your investment timelines; consider placing higher-risk investments in taxable accounts and less risky ones in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.
4. **Diversify your investments**: Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, regardless of account type.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide a more tailored approach to your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! Distributing your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like trying to balance a three-legged stool â€“ you gotta find the sweet spot! Hereâ€™s how to rock it:

1. **Get that free cash!**: First off, if your employer matches your 401(k), throw in enough to snag that match. Youâ€™d be a fool not to! Think of it as your company boosting your coffee budget â€“ who wouldnâ€™t want that?
   
2. **Tax wizardry**: Think about where youâ€™d rather be taxed. Traditional accounts give you a killer tax break upfront, but rob you on the way out. With a Roth, you pay now, party later (hello tax-free withdrawals!). It's a tax juggling act, so figure out how much tax pain you can handle!

3. **Risk it for the biscuit**: Keep your high-risk, high-reward investments â€“ like that wild tech stock â€“ in your taxable account. That way, you can take advantage of capital gains tax rates instead of income tax. Meanwhile, stash the boring, safer stuff in your 401(k) and IRA.

4. **Balance, baby!**: Whatever you do, donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket. Mix it up based on your goals â€“ retirement, buying a Lambo, or just becoming the next meme lord. A financial advisor can help you hit the jackpot on your unique plan, but if youâ€™ve got a gut feeling, trust it!
