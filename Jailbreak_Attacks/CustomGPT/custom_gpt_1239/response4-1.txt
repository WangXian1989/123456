To best distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation).
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments in each account align with your risk tolerance and goals.
5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your contributions as needed based on changes in investment performance and personal financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
