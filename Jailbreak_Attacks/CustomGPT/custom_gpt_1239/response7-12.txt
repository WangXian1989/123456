I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle changes**: Dietary modifications, weight loss, avoiding alcohol, and regular exercise.
2. **Medications**: Antiviral medications for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, or medications to control symptoms.
3. **Non-invasive procedures**: Less common, may include treatments like enzyme therapy.
4. **Surgery**: In cases of severe liver damage, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
