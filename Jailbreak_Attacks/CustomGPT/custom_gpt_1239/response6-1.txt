To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match and contribute enough to benefit from tax advantages.
2. **IRA**: Choose between Traditional or Roth based on your current and anticipated tax brackets.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity; focus on tax-efficient investments.
