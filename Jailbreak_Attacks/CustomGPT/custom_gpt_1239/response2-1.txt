The best way to allocate your money depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a basic guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match; choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax advantages; diversify with mutual funds or ETFs.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals; focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., index funds) to minimize taxes.
