The best distribution strategy depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages before using taxable accounts. Aim for a diversified investment mix across all accounts based on your timeline, balancing growth and income. Consulting a financial advisor is also wise for personalized guidance.
