When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies to consider based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a breakdown of the best practices:

### **1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
- Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
- This is often the first step in your retirement savings strategy.

### **2. Contribute to an IRA**
- After maximizing the employer match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
- A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions in the year you contribute.

### **3. Continue Contributions to 401(k)**
- After reaching IRA limits (in 2024, the limit for contributions is $6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older), funnel more money into your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit ($23,000 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older in 2024).

### **4. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
- If you still have funds left after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts.
- Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but come with capital gains taxes on profits.

### **5. Asset Allocation and Diversification**
- Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market conditions.
- Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) might be suitable in taxable accounts to help minimize tax implications.

### **6. Keep an Eye on Taxes**
- Understand the tax implications of each account type and adjust your contributions accordingly.
- For instance, withdrawing from taxable accounts might minimize tax in some years, especially if you have low income.

### **7. Review and Adjust Regularly**
- Review your asset allocation and contribution strategy regularly based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
The best distribution often depends on your personal financial situation, so it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy.
