Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income. Consider a Roth IRA (if eligible) where contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold, which can be at a lower rate than ordinary income tax. They also provide more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to balance risk and return. 

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Consider your investment timeline and risk tolerance. Generally, the longer you have until retirement, the more you might invest in stocks for growth, whereas shorter timelines may call for more conservative investments like bonds.

6. **Adjust Annually**: Revisit your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in income, expenses, financial goals, and market conditions.

Lastly, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation and help optimize your investment strategy.
