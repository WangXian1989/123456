Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.” After that, consider maxing out contributions if you can, as 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). The choice between these depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds can go into taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, but keep in mind capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid form (like a savings account) before making significant investments.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.).
- **Investment Horizon**: Align your investments with your time horizon. For longer-term goals, you might be able to take on more risk.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can help optimize your investment strategy.

This strategy is a high-level view; your financial situation may require adjustments. Always consider your personal circumstances and consult with a financial advisor for tailored guidance.
