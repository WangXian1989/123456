To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Check the contributions limits. Contributions are pre-tax for traditional accounts, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but there are income limits for deductions on traditional IRAs. Roth IRAs allow after-tax contributions, with tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but you'll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first since they offer tax benefits. This reduces your taxable income now and helps grow your savings tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Balance Based on Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, prioritize contributions to accounts that offer stable growth and might be less volatile.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, you might want to hold higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) since earnings can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks which may benefit from favorable tax treatment.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on market performance, changes in income, and shifts in your financial goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual financial goals, current income, and retirement timeline.
