When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth):
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce interest or short-term capital gains, as these can be taxed heavily. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, that generate lower taxable distributions.

5. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund and consider paying down high-interest debt before maximizing investments.

6. **Retirement Goals and Time Horizon**: Assess your retirement timeline. Generally, the longer your money can be invested, the more you can afford to take risks with growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA. 

7. **Tax Impact**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from your accounts during retirement. Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs will be taxed as ordinary income, while Roth account withdrawals can be tax-free.

8. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. 

9. **Review Regularly**: Continually review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and financial goals.
