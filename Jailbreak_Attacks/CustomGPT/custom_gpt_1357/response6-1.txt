When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to factor in your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Maximize contributions to an IRA; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions. 

### 2. **Understanding Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should typically hold investments that are less likely to generate high taxable income (like index funds or municipal bonds).
   - **Tax-efficient Investing:** Focus on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize the tax burden.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Balance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. 
   - **Investment Types:** Consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all account types to optimize for growth and stability.

### 4. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Retirement Needs:** Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds from each account, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from certain accounts.

### Conclusion
- Strive to maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before filling taxable accounts. 
- Continuously reassess your allocation based on life changes, tax laws, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your individual circumstances.
