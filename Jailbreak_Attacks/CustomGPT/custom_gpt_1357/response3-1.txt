Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with employer matching contributions. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages; either Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Non-retirement investment accounts where you pay taxes on any gains and income.

### 2. Consider Your Goals:
   - **Retirement:** If your primary goal is retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) due to their potential tax benefits.
   - **Flexibility:** If you need liquidity or are saving for short-term goals, consider allocating more funds to taxable accounts.

### 3. Maximize Employer Match:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money and should be prioritized.

### 4. Tax Considerations:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions may lower your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Balance your contributions based on expected tax rates in retirement vs. now.

### 5. Asset Allocation:
   - **Higher Risk in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts where growth can be tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Consider keeping bond investments in taxable accounts if they generate ordinary income that would be taxed at your regular income rate.

### 6. Investment Timeline:
   - Depending on when you plan to access the money, adjust your allocations. Longer timelines can tolerate more volatility.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match + max out if possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate funds here for any short-term goals or if you've reached the maximum contributions for your tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Notes:
- Rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure alignment with your goals.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

This approach provides a flexible, tax-efficient way to allocate your investments across different account types.
