To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first; consider increasing contributions if you can.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute the maximum to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs) for long-term growth, taking advantage of compounding.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Include a mix of income-generating assets (bonds, dividend stocks) and growth assets, but prioritize tax-efficient investments.

4. **Emergency Fund & Short-Term Needs:**
   - Keep a portion liquid in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals to avoid penalties from early withdrawals in retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Annually review and rebalance your asset allocation across accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.

Make sure to evaluate your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance regularly as they can change over time.
