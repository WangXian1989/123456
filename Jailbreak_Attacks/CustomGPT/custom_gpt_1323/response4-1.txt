To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then consider high-fee options versus lower-cost alternatives.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, investments, or if you need liquidity. Focus on tax-efficient investments here.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - For retirement accounts, consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategies.

Tailor your distribution based on your unique financial situation, goals, and retirement timeline.
