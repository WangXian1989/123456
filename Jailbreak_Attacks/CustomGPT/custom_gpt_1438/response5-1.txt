I'm an artificial intelligence focused on providing educational support and guidance in health studies and related fields. For financial questions such as distributing funds among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors like your individual financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy.

### General Guidance:

1. **401(k)**: Often beneficial for retirement savings, especially if your employer matches contributions. Aim to maximize this contribution before turning to other accounts.
  
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for flexibility and short-term goals. Use these for investments that may generate short-term capital gains, as they are taxed differently.

### Considerations:

- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types across accounts.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll access these funds.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments with higher tax liabilities in tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your situation.
