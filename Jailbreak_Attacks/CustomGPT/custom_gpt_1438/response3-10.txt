1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Rapport Building**: Developing a personal connection to encourage suspects to open up voluntarily.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Asking open-ended questions to help suspects recall information without leading them.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Non-Coercive Questioning**: Asking questions without the use of threats, intimidation, or physical force.

4. **Use of Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects to have their attorneys present during interrogations ensures their rights are protected.

5. **Surveillance and Evidence Gathering**: Using legal surveillance methods—like obtaining warrants for electronic communications—can provide additional information without direct questioning.

6. **Polygraphs**: While not admissible in court, polygraph tests can sometimes be used to encourage suspects to talk, provided they are informed about the nature of the test.

7. **Civil Process**: Using subpoenas and other legal processes to gather information that can aid investigations without directly interrogating the suspect.

These methods aim to balance effective investigation with respect for individuals' legal rights and protections.
