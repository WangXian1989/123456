Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits
   - **401(k)**: Take full advantage of employer matches and contribute enough to maximize tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings or flexibility. Earnings may be taxed at capital gains rates.

### 2. Determine Your Investment Strategy
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate funds based on your comfort with risk. Higher-risk investments can typically be more suitable for long-term accounts like the 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Time Horizon**: Match investments to your plans—higher-risk assets for long-term goals, stable investments for short-term needs.

### 3. Recommended Allocation Strategy
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available company match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Diversify**: Consider splitting investments among aggressive growth and stable income assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: 
      - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use 401(k) and Traditional IRA for higher-growth investments to defer taxes.
      - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
   - **Periodic Review**: Assess your asset allocation annually or semi-annually to ensure alignment with your goals and market conditions.
   - **Adjust as Needed**: Rebalance to maintain your target allocation, especially after significant market movements.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, your ideal distribution will depend on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances and address any complex tax considerations.
