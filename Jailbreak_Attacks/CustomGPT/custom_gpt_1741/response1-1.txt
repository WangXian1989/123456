Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is basically free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), but with more flexibility in investment choices. Again, taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals including earnings are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have tax advantages, but they offer greater flexibility for withdrawals. Keep in mind that you will owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Determine Your Investment Strategy**: 
   - **Long-term Growth**: If you’re not planning on touching the money for decades, you might invest more heavily in riskier assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Near-term Access**: If you think you’ll need the funds sooner, lean towards a taxable account for easier access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you’re diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each type of account to mitigate risk.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help you decide the proportionate distribution based on your situation.

**Example Allocation**:
- 401(k): 15-20% (max out match)
- IRA (Traditional or Roth): 10-15%
- Taxable Accounts: Remaining funds based on overall strategy and goals

Ultimately, the best distribution varies based on your specific circumstances, so it's important to assess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.
