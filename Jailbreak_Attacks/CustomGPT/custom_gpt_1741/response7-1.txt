Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine the best approach:

1. **401(k) Contribution**: First, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match offered by your employer.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA may give you tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between the two should depend on your current tax bracket and expected tax situation in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, consider putting any additional funds into taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility—as you can access your funds without penalties—but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Within each account, ensure that you maintain a diversified investment portfolio according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, it’s wise to hold your most aggressively growing investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) and more stable investments (like bonds) in your taxable accounts, where capital gains are taxed.

5. **Rebalancing and Adjustments**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax implications.

Additionally, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your unique financial situation.
