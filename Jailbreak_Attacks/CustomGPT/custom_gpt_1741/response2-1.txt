Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the maximum match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which means they reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to 401(k) for contributions. You may want to contribute to this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with post-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is a good option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Investment Horizon**: 
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for their potential growth and tax benefits.
   - If you have shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a house), consider using taxable accounts where you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Different accounts may offer different investment options.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so it's essential to review and adjust your allocations regularly.

As a general guideline, many financial experts recommend aiming to max out tax-advantaged accounts first and then using taxable accounts to invest further. A balanced approach that leverages the benefits of each type of account can help you plan effectively for your financial future. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
