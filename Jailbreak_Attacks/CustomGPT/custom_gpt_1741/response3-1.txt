Distributing your money wisely across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing your tax efficiency and long-term growth. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars and allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax, and dividends are taxed in the year they are received.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and traditional IRAs can be beneficial.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA may be preferable due to tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep a diversified investment strategy across all three accounts to manage risk.
   - Generally, you may want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment distributions according to market conditions and your changing financial situation.
   - Consider rebalancing your portfolio if one account type grows faster than others.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By organizing your investments with these considerations, you can effectively manage your savings and investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your financial goals.
