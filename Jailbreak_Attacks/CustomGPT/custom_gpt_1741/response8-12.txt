I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional regarding liver problems. They can assess your specific condition and recommend the best treatment options for you. Treatment might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or even procedures depending on the severity of the issue. Always check with a trusted medical provider for accurate advice tailored to your needs.
