The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, meaning you won't pay income tax on that money until you withdraw it in retirement. This can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you may get tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth). Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Here, you will pay capital gains tax on your earnings when you sell investments, so it's often wise to hold long-term investments that generate qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This means spreading your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

4. **Account for Liquidity Needs**: If you need access to your money before retirement, prioritize funding your taxable accounts for those needs, while maximizing the tax-advantaged accounts for long-term savings.

5. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Always be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50)
   - IRA: $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50)

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Your asset allocation may change over time due to market performance. Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your individual situation, consider reaching out to a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, maximizing your savings and minimizing potential tax burdens over time.
