The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing elsewhere—it's essentially free money.
   - Contribute to the maximum limit if you're in a higher tax bracket, as it reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - A Traditional IRA may be more beneficial if you want to reduce your current tax burden. Check income limits that apply.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate tax-efficient returns, such as index funds, which tend to have lower turnover and thus lower capital gains.
   - They can be great for more flexible withdrawals, as they aren’t subject to early withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Aim for a balanced asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance (stocks vs. bonds).
   - Be mindful of tax implications for selling investments in taxable accounts and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Review your allocations annually or when significant financial changes occur to ensure they align with your long-term goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor would also provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
