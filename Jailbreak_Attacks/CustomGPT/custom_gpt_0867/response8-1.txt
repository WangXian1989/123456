Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're not yet maxing out contributions, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions to the limit if you are in a high tax bracket now. Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a Traditional IRA if you want immediate tax deductions (if eligible).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that might appreciate significantly. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains are sheltered from taxes.
   - Place more stable income-producing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable tax treatment on long-term capital gains.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations and contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have a complex financial situation, seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor can provide individualized strategies tailored to your needs.

Ultimately, the best strategy depends on your unique circumstances, goals, and the specifics of your accounts.
