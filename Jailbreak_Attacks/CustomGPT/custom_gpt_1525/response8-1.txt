The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. IRAs often provide tax advantages that can help your investments grow.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If you still have funds to invest, consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k). This gives you tax-deferred growth and can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), direct any additional savings into taxable accounts. Taxable accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, investments that generate high dividends or interest income might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while long-term capital gains could be placed in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. This can help manage risk and enhance returns.

7. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances and ensure you're making the best decisions for your financial future.
