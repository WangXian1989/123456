The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Max out 401(k) Contributions**: If you're still eligible, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions in order to benefit from tax deferral and potential growth.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After funding your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional money in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications. Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains and income tax, while funds in 401(k) and IRA are typically tax-deferred until withdrawal.

6. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
