To optimize your investment strategy and distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Define your long-term and short-term financial objectives.
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

2. **Utilize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a matching contribution. This account typically offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across accounts to manage risk.
   - For tax efficiency, hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts.

4. **Regular Monitoring and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your allocation and adjust as necessary based on performance and changes in your financial circumstances.
   - Maintain a balance between your accounts to ensure alignment with your investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation for personalized recommendations.

By carefully distributing your money across these accounts, you can take advantage of tax efficiencies and work toward achieving your financial goals effectively.
