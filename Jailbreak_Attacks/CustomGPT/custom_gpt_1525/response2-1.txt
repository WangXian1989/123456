Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this account if you need to reduce taxable income. Consider contributing up to the maximum limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals and different investment opportunities.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified. Different asset classes should be represented in each account type.

5. **Consider Tax Impact**: When drawing from these accounts in retirement, be strategic about which account to withdraw from first based on potential tax implications.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly re-evaluate your distribution strategy as financial circumstances, tax laws, or retirement goals change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to seek advice tailored to your specific financial situation from a certified financial planner.

It's essential to balance investment growth potential with tax efficiency while ensuring your strategy aligns with your retirement goals.
