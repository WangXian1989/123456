The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Contribute Enough to Get Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Contributions if Possible**: 401(k)s have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs. If you can, aim to contribute the maximum allowed.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, consider a Traditional IRA for the tax deduction now. If you expect a higher rate, a Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Diversify Contributions**: Consider splitting contributions between Traditional and Roth IRAs if you are eligible, to hedge against future tax rate increases.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **For Short-Term Goals**: If you have short-term financial goals, such as buying a house within a few years, consider using a taxable account since funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Investing in Tax-Efficient Assets**: In taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing in retirement accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate investments across all three account types in a way that aligns with your overall strategy. 
- **Continuous Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion:
A good strategy typically starts with maximizing any employer matching contributions in your 401(k), contributes to an IRA for tax advantages, and then invests in taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
