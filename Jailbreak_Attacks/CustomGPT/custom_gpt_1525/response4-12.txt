I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition you have, whether it's fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or something else. Generally, treatment may include lifestyle changes, medication, or in severe cases, surgery. Regular monitoring and following your doctor's recommendations are crucial for managing liver health.
