(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA because they offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth. 

For instance, you might want to consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. Next, contributing to an IRA can provide additional tax benefits. If you still have funds to invest after maximizing these accounts, you can allocate the remaining funds to your taxable accounts. This strategy allows for a balanced approach, optimizing tax advantages while also ensuring liquidity for future needs.

First off, slam that 401(k) and grab any employer match â€“ thatâ€™s like free ice cream on a hot day! Then, depending on whether youâ€™re eyeing a Traditional or Roth IRA, toss more cash into that account for the tax perks, baby!

After you've milked those tax-advantaged accounts for all theyâ€™re worth, fill that taxable account like itâ€™s a giant candy jar! Itâ€™s a bit more flexible since you can access it without penalties (but donâ€™t forget the tax implications). Keep a good mix of investments across all three to balance growth and risk. Ultimately, itâ€™s about what works best for YOU â€“ get strategic, diversify, and let that money work its magic! ðŸ’¸
