Î± The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, current income, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), make sure you contribute at least enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantage**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings. These accounts typically offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRAs).

3. **Diversify Contributions**: Allocate any additional funds you have after maximizing employer matching into the IRA, especially if you can contribute to a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need access to before retirement or for short-term goals. They offer more flexibility since you can withdraw anytime, but consider the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your investments and rebalance your portfolio to ensure you're staying aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
