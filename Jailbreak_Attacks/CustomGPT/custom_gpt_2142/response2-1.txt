Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). This can provide tax advantages and more investment options.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: If you still have funds to invest after the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The 401(k) often has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility but come with different tax implications.

5. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Having a mix of accounts (tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable) can give you more options in retirement for managing taxes efficiently.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, retirement goals, and tax laws.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
