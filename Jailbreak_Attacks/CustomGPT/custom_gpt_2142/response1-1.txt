Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. These accounts often offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial. If you think you’ll be in a higher bracket, a Roth IRA could be the way to go since withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Utilize Your 401(k)**: If you still have room in your budget after maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if it has good investment options and low fees.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and a variety of investment options, but they do come with capital gains taxes to consider.

6. **Diversify Investments**: No matter where you’re investing, make sure to diversify your assets across different sectors and asset classes to manage risk effectively.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your situation will change over time, so it’s a good idea to regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on your life circumstances and market conditions.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs!
