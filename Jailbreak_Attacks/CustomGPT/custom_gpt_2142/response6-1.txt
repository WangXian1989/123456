Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here's a simplified approach to help you decide:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions, so maximize this benefit first. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: You can choose between traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (post-tax) IRAs. Consider your current versus future tax situation when deciding.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible and allow for easy access to funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

2. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you're saving for retirement, a more aggressive allocation in tax-advantaged accounts might be beneficial.
   - For shorter-term needs, prioritize taxable accounts for their accessibility.

3. **Allocate Your Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for tax deductions with a traditional IRA or prefer tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

4. **Reassess Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and balancing contributions based on your needs, you can effectively optimize your investment strategy for both growth and accessibility.
