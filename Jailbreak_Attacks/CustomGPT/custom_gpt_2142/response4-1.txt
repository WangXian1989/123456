To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

2. **Understand contribution limits**: Familiarize yourself with the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and above).

3. **Assess your employer match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Diversify investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio in each account type to manage risk and capitalize on different asset classes. This may include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

5. **Consider tax implications**: Choose investments wisely based on their tax treatment. For instance, placing high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts can help you avoid capital gains taxes, while more stable investments could be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. This ensures that you stay aligned with your investment strategy.

7. **Emergency savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, allowing your retirement accounts to grow undisturbed.

Implementing a systematic approach and regularly reviewing your investment distribution can help you optimize your financial outcomes over time. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
