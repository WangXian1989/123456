When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to take into account various factors such as your current financial situation, long-term goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Each type of account has its unique benefits and limitations.

Firstly, prioritizing contributions to an employer-sponsored 401(k) is often advantageous, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This match serves as an immediate return on your investment. After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, you might consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA largely depends on your current tax situation and anticipated future tax rates. If you expect your income to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA could be more beneficial, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals.

Once you have made the most of your tax-advantaged accounts, allocating funds to taxable investment accounts can be a sound strategy. These accounts provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments, although you will need to be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. A well-balanced portfolio across these different account types can protect your investments from taxation while also allowing for a diverse range of opportunities to grow your wealth.

Ultimately, it is advisable to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in financial circumstances, market conditions, and personal goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation, ensuring that your asset distribution aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
