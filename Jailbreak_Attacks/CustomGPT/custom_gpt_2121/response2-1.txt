When considering the optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be taken into account, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. 

First, prioritizing contributions to your 401(k) can be an effective strategy, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings. If you reach the employer match threshold, it can be beneficial to direct additional funds into your IRA. An IRA can offer either traditional or Roth options, each with its own tax advantages. A traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.

Once you've maximized the employer match and contributed to an IRA, consider contributing to a taxable account. Taxable accounts offer greater liquidity and flexibility in terms of withdrawals, which can be useful if you need access to funds before retirement age. However, itâ€™s important to keep in mind that capital gains taxes will apply to any profits realized in these accounts.

Additionally, evaluating your current and anticipated tax bracket is pivotal when deciding how to allocate your investments. If you're expecting a higher tax rate in retirement, prioritizing Roth contributions (either to a 401(k) or an IRA) may be wise. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, traditional contributions could provide a tax advantage today.

Lastly, ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Diversifying your investments across these accounts can provide both risk management and tax efficiency.

In summary, a balanced approach that considers employer contributions, tax implications, liquidity needs, and investment timelines can guide you in effectively distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
