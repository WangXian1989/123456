To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year, and investment growth is tax-deferred. Consider maxing out your employer match if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions (subject to income limits), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. They provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, but tax implications should be considered when selling assets.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, education, etc.) and time frame, as this will influence your asset allocation.
   - Longer time horizons can tolerate more risk, typically favoring stocks over bonds, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate), sectors, and geographic regions to reduce risk.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (with an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Consider how and when you might need to access your funds. Penalties may apply to early withdrawals from retirement accounts, while taxable accounts allow more flexibility.

6. **Overall Portfolio Strategy**:
   - Develop a cohesive overall investment strategy. For example, you might choose to hold conservative investments in your IRA and more aggressive investments in your taxable account, depending on your risk tolerance and investment time frame.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired allocation percentages across all accounts.

By evaluating these factors, you can create a tailored strategy that balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and flexibility, aligning with your financial goals and circumstances. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
