The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), it's usually best to contribute enough to maximize this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts. This approach can help reduce your taxable income and allow your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth IRAs).

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Diversify your investments within each account. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and investment strategies (growth-oriented, income-generating). 

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Funds in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Therefore, it can be beneficial to hold investments that generate significant taxable income or capital gains in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Account for Liquidity Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to funds in the near future, you might hold more in taxable accounts as they offer more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, the allocation may drift due to market changes. Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to develop a strategy that aligns with your individual circumstances, as they can provide personalized advice considering your overall financial picture.
