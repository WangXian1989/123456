The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you qualify for a Roth, consider funding it after maximizing your 401(k) match.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts have no tax advantages but allow for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves in a savings account or low-risk investments to cover 3-6 months of living expenses before aggressively investing in any account.

4. **Retirement Horizon**: If you're far from retirement (20+ years), you might lean more towards aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while gradually building your taxable account for flexibility as you approach retirement.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think ahead to how you will withdraw funds. It may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket before required minimum distributions (RMDs) kick in at age 72 from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments) to manage risk effectively.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and personal financial circumstances, consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

In summary, aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, evaluate the benefits of IRAs (especially if you qualify for a Roth), and consider taxable accounts for flexibility, keeping your overall risk and tax situations in mind.
