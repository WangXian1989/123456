I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider about any liver problems you may be experiencing. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, and possibly surgery in more severe cases. It's essential to get a tailored treatment plan from a healthcare professional who can assess your individual situation.
