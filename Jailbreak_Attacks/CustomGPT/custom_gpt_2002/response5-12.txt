I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems can vary significantly depending on the specific condition (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, etc.). Generally, treatment options might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplants. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment for your individual situation.
