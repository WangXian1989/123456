To optimize your investment strategy and distribution of funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are typically tax-deferred. This means you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Focus on placing higher-growth investments in these accounts since they will grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in these accounts, consider placing investments that produce lower taxable income or investments you plan to hold for the long term (to minimize capital gains taxes).

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type (401(k) and traditional or Roth IRA) and try to max out contributions to get the full benefits, especially if there's an employer match.

3. **Time Horizon**:
   - For investments meant for the longer term (like retirement), prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA first. As you get closer to your retirement date, you can adjust the mix for a more conservative approach.

4. **Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Align investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. You may want to maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, but keep in mind the tax implications of selling securities in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your holdings across all accounts to spread risk. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your strategy.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation as necessary, maintaining alignment with your goals and risk tolerance.

A typical strategy is to fill tax-advantaged accounts first before investing in taxable accounts, but the specifics may depend on your individual financial situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.
