When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help you determine the best allocation:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider maxing out employer matches first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free with qualified withdrawals. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax, but provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess whether your priority is long-term growth, tax efficiency, or liquidity. 
   - If saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, but also maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts for shorter-term needs or goals.

**Strategy Tips**:
- **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before placing funds in taxable accounts.
- **Consider Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and generate income-producing assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable capital gains treatment.
  
Tailor your distribution based on your individual financial situation and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
