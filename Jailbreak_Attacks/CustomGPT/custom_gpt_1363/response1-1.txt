When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so these can be effective for investments you might need to access before retirement.

3. **Balance Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits:
   - For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50+).
   - The IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider using more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, as withdrawals will be taxed later, while keeping more conservative or income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Plan for Future Withdrawals**: Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, it might make sense to prioritize traditional accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Because everyone's financial situation is unique, it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By strategically distributing your contributions among these accounts, you can take advantage of tax benefits and set yourself up for long-term financial success.
