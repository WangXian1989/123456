When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general guide to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) up to the annual limit. This can provide additional tax advantages.

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you have more money to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can then distribute funds into your taxable accounts. Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but will be taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also pre-tax, while Roth IRAs use post-tax dollars, and qualifying withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here don't offer tax advantages upfront but come with more flexibility and potential tax efficiency through long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

The best strategy will vary based on your personal situation, so consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
