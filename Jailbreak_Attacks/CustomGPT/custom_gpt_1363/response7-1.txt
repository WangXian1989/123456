Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**: Contributions to your 401(k) are typically made with pre-tax dollars, which can lower your taxable income now. If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money. After maxing out the match, you should consider your overall strategy before contributing more here.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can either be tax-deductible (Traditional) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth). If your income allows, consider maxing out your IRA contributions since they often offer more investment options compared to a 401(k) and can provide tax advantages in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for savings or investment goals outside of retirement. They offer flexibility since you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties. Here, focus on holding long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes and consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

- **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full match (e.g., 3-6% of your salary).
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (currently $6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50+ in 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for taxable savings or investments.

Always reassess your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, age, and market conditions, and it may be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. 

It's crucial to invest based on your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals to ensure a balanced approach to wealth accumulation.
