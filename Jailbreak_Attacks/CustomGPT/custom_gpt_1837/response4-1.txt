Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for those in a higher income bracket now who expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions but may have income limits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for short-term goals. Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider tax-efficient investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity through savings or a taxable account before maximizing retirement contributions.

5. **Age and Time Horizon**: Consider your age and when you'll need the money. Younger investors can typically afford to take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as needed, based on market conditions and changes in your personal situation.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a good idea.
