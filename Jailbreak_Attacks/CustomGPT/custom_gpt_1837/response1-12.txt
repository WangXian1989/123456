I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.
3. **Interventions**: In severe cases, treatments like liver transplant or procedures to address blockages might be necessary.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests to monitor progress.

Always discuss with your doctor for the best personalized treatment plan.
