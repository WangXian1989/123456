Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts First**: Fund your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. They offer tax benefits that can grow your investments more efficiently.

3. **Choose Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA. If you want to reduce your taxable income now, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may be better.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs. These can minimize short-term capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your portfolio at least annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Withdrawals**: If you anticipate needing money before retirement, maintain a balance in your taxable accounts for easier access.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
