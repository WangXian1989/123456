When considering how to effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Understand Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - In higher tax brackets, a Traditional IRA or 401(k), which offers tax-deferred growth, might be more advantageous.

3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term growth (e.g., retirement), prioritize funds in the 401(k) and IRA due to their tax benefits. 
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or for investments that may produce taxable income (like dividends or interest).

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, as they generate less taxable income.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation and objectives.
