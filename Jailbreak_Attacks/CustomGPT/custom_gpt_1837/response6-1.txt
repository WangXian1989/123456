Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider fully funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax implications.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Impact**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible now but taxed upon withdrawal. Good for high-income earners looking to reduce current taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free growth. Ideal for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Once you’ve maxed your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, fund taxable accounts. This is beneficial for:
     - **Liquidity**: Emergency funds or short-term goals.
     - **Tax Planning**: Managing capital gains and losses strategically.

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Choices**
   - Tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) are more suitable for taxable accounts.

### 5. **Evaluate Regularly**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio annually to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help navigate complex tax situations and retirement planning.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing tax implications.
