Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guide to help you:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, which can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that don’t have tax advantages. You'll pay capital gains tax on profits when assets are sold.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. It’s essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Good for reducing current taxes. You’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short- to medium-term goals since they provide more flexibility.

### 4. **Diversify Contributions**
   - After securing your employer match, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (especially if you can contribute to a Roth IRA).
   - Invest remaining funds in your 401(k) up to the annual limit, then direct excess funds into your taxable account for flexibility and potential higher growth.

### 5. **Allocation Strategies**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on the account type; for example, place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess**
   - Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation and goals change. Factors like age, market performance, and tax laws should influence your strategy.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 15% of gross income (up to match)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for those 50+)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining savings (after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts)

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution strategy based on your unique financial situation and objectives. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
