When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to balance tax efficiency, liquidity, and investment goals. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, distributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and potential deductions based on income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be an excellent option for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals. Consider holding investments with lower capital gains tax impacts here.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals like retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - For shorter-term goals or emergencies, maintain liquidity through a taxable account.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts to manage risk. This might mean holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Reassess your allocations regularly based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be beneficial based on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
