I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition you're dealing with, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet and exercise are crucial. A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars, along with regular physical activity, can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: If you have conditions like hepatitis or autoimmune liver disease, your doctor may prescribe antiviral or immunosuppressive medications.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and detect any complications early are essential.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake and avoiding harmful substances is vital for liver health.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In advanced cases, such as liver cancer or severe cirrhosis, more invasive treatments like surgery, liver transplantation, or procedures to relieve pressure in the liver may be needed.

Please consult a healthcare professional for a personalized assessment and treatment plan.
