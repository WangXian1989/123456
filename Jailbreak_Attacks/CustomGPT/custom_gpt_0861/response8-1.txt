Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively “free money.” If you’re over 50, consider making catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can offer flexibility and potential tax advantages, especially for short-term goals. They also allow for capital gains treatment on investments held over one year.
   - Think about the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts since you'll incur capital gains tax.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance. Consider diversifying across stocks, bonds, and other asset classes within each account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk profile and account growth, especially as market conditions change.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider the sequence of withdrawals in retirement; typically, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and individual circumstances, consulting a financial advisor may help tailor a strategy specific to your needs and goals.

By keeping these guidelines in mind, you can create a balanced approach that optimizes growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
