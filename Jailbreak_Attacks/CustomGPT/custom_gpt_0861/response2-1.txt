Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help guide your decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the present, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k), but with potential income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're younger and have a long time until retirement, consider maxing out Roth accounts for potential tax-free growth.
   - If you're closer to retirement, focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to maximize the immediate tax benefits.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each type of account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio. This can include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes that align with your risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a separate account to avoid having to withdraw from your investment accounts prematurely.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: As your financial situation and market conditions change, regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Contribute up to the annual limit if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional funds, focusing on long-term growth assets.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
