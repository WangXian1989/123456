Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if you're financially able.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Impact**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth Accounts (IRA or 401(k))**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Allocate for Flexibility with Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments.
   - Investments here can be more flexible, allowing withdrawals without penalties, but they don’t provide tax benefits like retirement accounts.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - Adjust your investment allocation (stocks vs. bonds) based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors can typically take on more risk with a higher percentage in stocks.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Early Career (Age 20s-30s)**: Focus on maxing out 401(k) contributions for employer match, contribute to a Roth IRA for long-term growth, and save in a taxable account for immediate goals.
- **Mid-Career (Age 40s)**: Balance contributions between 401(k) and traditional IRA, while using taxable accounts to cover any short-term needs.
- **Pre-Retirement (Age 50s+)**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions, possibly shifting to more conservative investments, and reduce taxable account contributions unless needed for cash flow.

### Final Considerations
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices based on your financial situation and goals.
