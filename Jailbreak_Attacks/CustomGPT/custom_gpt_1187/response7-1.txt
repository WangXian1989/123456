Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and long-term financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you qualify for catch-up contributions (if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: If you can, also put money into a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider adding to taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility in accessing funds for short- to mid-term goals, such as buying a house or other investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account. Generally, you might want to emphasize growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and use taxable accounts for more income-generating investments (like bonds) to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds generating interest) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help tailor a strategy to your unique situation.
