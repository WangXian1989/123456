Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to this first, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth options) before increasing contributions to your 401(k).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on dividends, interest, and realized capital gains. Use these for shorter-term goals or investments that may generate income.

4. **Investment Horizons**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For mid-term goals (buying a house, etc.), consider saving in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Diversification and Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio in each account type to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual situation.
