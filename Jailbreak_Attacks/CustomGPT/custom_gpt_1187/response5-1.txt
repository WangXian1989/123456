(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's a great tax-deferred option.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can be beneficial for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, such as individual stocks or when you need more liquidity. It's also a good place for investments that produce qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

Be sure to consider your risk tolerance, investment strategy, and any tax implications based on your current and expected future income.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's get down to brass tacks! Figuring out how to juggle your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like a financial game of Tetris. Hereâ€™s the deal:

1. **401(k)**: First, if your employer is tossing in matching funds, snag that free cash! Itâ€™s like finding money on the sidewalk. Aim for the max contribution if you can swing it.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, go for it! Tax-free growth in retirement? Yes, please! If not, hit up a traditional IRA for those juicy tax deductions instead.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your playground for flexibility. Invest in things that might not pack the same punch in tax-advantaged accounts like high-growth stocks or actively managed funds. Plus, any qualified dividends come with a sweet tax break.

Remember, this isnâ€™t just about where to throw your cash; consider your goals, how soon you need the money, and your risk appetite. Itâ€™s your moneyâ€”work it like a pro!
