Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k) Contribution**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any available employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: If your 401(k) allows for Roth contributions, evaluate whether to contribute pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) based on your expected tax rate at retirement.
   - **IRA Options**: Use a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - **401(k) for Growth**: Allocate more funds to your 401(k) if it offers strong investment options or low fees.
   - **IRA for Tax Flexibility**: Use your IRA to balance out tax implications; consider traditional for tax-deferred growth and Roth for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency savings, as they provide more liquidity without penalties.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Timeline and Goals**
   - **Short vs. Long-Term**: Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth and use taxable accounts for short-term needs or flexibility.
   - **Withdrawal Timing**: Plan for tax implications based on when you intend to access these funds. Consider penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts and how it impacts your overall tax bracket.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - **Adjust Contributions**: Periodically assess your contributions based on performance and changing goals. Adjust the mix as your financial situation evolves, especially as you near retirement.

### Conclusion
Developing a balanced approach between these accounts can optimize your savings growth, tax efficiency, and future withdrawal strategies. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
