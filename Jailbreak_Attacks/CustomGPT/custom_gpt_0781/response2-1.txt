When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to factor in various aspects like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, especially if there's a match. The contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing out your 401(k) (or if your employer doesn't offer a match), consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Tax Situations**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be lower in retirement, prioritize Traditional accounts (401(k) or Traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider Roth options which are taxed now but grow tax-free later.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts for liquidity. This can help if you want to access funds before retirement or for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, maintain an appropriate asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. You may want to keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investments and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, economic conditions, and retirement goals.

It's always beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
