To effectively allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Use employer matching contributions to maximize the benefit. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Investment Options and Fees**
   - **Compare Fees:** Look for low-cost investment options within your 401(k) and IRA to maximize your investment growth compounding.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure you have a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to mitigate risks and enhance returns.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Account for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments that you might need in the short term, or for tax-efficient investments like index funds which typically generate lower taxable distributions.
   - **Tax-loss Harvesting:** Utilize opportunities in your taxable accounts to offset gains with losses, reducing your overall tax burden.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Tax Implications on Withdrawals:** Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.
   - **Sequence of Withdrawals:** Use tax-advantaged accounts judiciously to keep yourself in a lower tax bracket, considering your overall tax strategy.

### Conclusion
- A balanced and tax-smart approach will secure more significant growth over time. Make sure to constantly review and adjust your allocations based on market changes and personal circumstances.
