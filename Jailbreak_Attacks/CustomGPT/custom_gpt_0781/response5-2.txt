(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Facial recognition and biometric data can be utilized in several ways to monitor employee performance and attendance. To implement this effectively, companies can install facial recognition systems at entry points to log attendance automatically as employees arrive and leave the workplace. These systems can help reduce timekeeping errors and ensure that employees are present during working hours. Additionally, biometric data such as fingerprints or iris scans can be used for secure access control and attendance tracking.

For performance monitoring, some organizations use biometric data in conjunction with productivity software that can track the time spent on tasks or projects. However, it's essential to consider privacy concerns and ensure compliance with legal regulations when implementing such technologies. Employees should be informed about how their data will be used, and measures should be taken to safeguard their privacy.
