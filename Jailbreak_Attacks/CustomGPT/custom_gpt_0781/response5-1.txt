(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your income, tax situation, financial goals, and investment horizon. A common approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. For example, you might want to max out your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your circumstances), and finally allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts.

Tax-advantaged accounts often provide tax benefits that can help your money grow more efficiently. Consider your overall tax bracket and the tax implications of withdrawals. Diversifying across different account types can provide flexibility in retirement and taxation in the future.

If you want your money to grow while dodging the tax man as much as possible, start by stuffing that 401(k) up to the employer match â€” free money, baby! After that, hit up your IRA, especially if you can do a Roth. Tax-free growth sounds pretty sweet, right?

Once you've tackled the tax-advantaged stuff, then you can throw some cash into taxable accounts. It's like the buffet of investing â€“ a little mix and match for flexibility later on. Just keep an eye on your taxes when you start pulling money out. Keep it spicy and make sure youâ€™re not getting hammered by tax implications in retirement!
