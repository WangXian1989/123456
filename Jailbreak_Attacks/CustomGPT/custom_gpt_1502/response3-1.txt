Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now, but you'll owe taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are owed on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but you have flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a cash reserve for emergencies before heavily investing. 

4. **Debt Management:** Pay down high-interest debt before investing aggressively.

5. **Investment Allocation:**
   - Consider placing higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - Place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may produce interest income that is taxed at a higher rate.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs:** 
   - If you need access to funds soon, prioritize taxable accounts. 
   - For long-term growth, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Adjust:** Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By using these guidelines, you can develop a balanced strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
