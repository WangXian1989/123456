To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contribution if possible, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider your tax situation; if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial. If youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA could be better, as it allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Optimize Asset Allocation
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Bonds and Stable Investments:** Consider placing lower-risk assets or bonds in your taxable account to minimize the impact of taxes on interest income.

### 3. Regularly Review Your Strategy
   - **Rebalance Your Portfolio:** Annually review the performance and reassess your risk tolerance and goals, adjusting contributions as needed.
   - **Tax Harvesting:** In taxable accounts, utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains and reduce tax liability.

### Conclusion
Balancing your contributions strategically across these accounts can maximize growth while minimizing taxes, aligning with both your short- and long-term financial goals.
