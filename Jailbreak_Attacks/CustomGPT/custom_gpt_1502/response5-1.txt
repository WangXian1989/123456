The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, if you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth is typically better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   
2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or after-tax dollars for flexibility, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age.

3. **Determine Your Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more to equities in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA, which allows tax-free growth.
   - **Lower-Risk Investments**: Place these in taxable accounts, where you might have more immediate access to funds.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your financial situation and market conditions change, review and adjust your allocations annually.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
