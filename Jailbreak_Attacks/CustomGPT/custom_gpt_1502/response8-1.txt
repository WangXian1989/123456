Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Utilize this account for pre-tax or Roth contributions depending on your tax bracket. Max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals, depending on your eligibility.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Consider these for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more liquid or short-term investments, keeping in mind capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an adequate cash reserve in a savings account for emergencies before heavily investing.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts, considering the overall asset allocation that reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and rebalance your portfolio as needed to stay aligned with your target asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially if your financial situation is complex, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By considering these strategies, you can create an efficient distribution of funds among your investment accounts that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
