Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. You can then contribute to the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions are usually tax-deductible now but taxed upon withdrawal. These accounts might be better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. These are beneficial if you believe your taxes will be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you've maxed out retirement accounts, or if you need funds that are not locked in until retirement, consider a taxable account. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can allow for capital gains treatment on investments held over a year.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Each account type can hold a mix of asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific circumstances and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution will vary for each individual, so it's important to assess your own financial picture.
