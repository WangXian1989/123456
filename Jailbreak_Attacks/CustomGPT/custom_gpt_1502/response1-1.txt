Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth for after-tax contributions), which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Use a Traditional IRA if you want tax-deductible contributions now.
   - **Diversification**: IRAs often have a wider range of investment options compared to a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easy access to funds without penalties, useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions, prioritizing a Roth IRA if it fits your situation.
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, invest any additional funds in a taxable account.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

3. **Rebalance Periodically**: 
   - Assess and adjust your allocations at least annually to stay in line with your goals.

4. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consider consulting a professional.

### Final Tip:
Keep an eye on the tax implications of withdrawals and asset growth in each account to optimize your overall tax strategy over time.
