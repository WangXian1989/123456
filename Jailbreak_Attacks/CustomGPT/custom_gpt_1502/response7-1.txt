Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Try to maximize your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial based on your current tax situation and future expectations. If eligible, max out contributions to your IRA after contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the match.

### 2. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts for additional contributions. Investors often use these for funds they might need before retirement, as they offer more accessibility without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Asset Location**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Hold investments that generate ordinary income here, like bonds and REITs, as taxes are deferred.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** This is ideal for high-growth investments like stocks, as you won’t pay taxes on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that trigger lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds and ETFs, and consider the timing of selling them to manage tax impacts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts. Regular reviews and adjustments are essential.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you’re unsure, seeking professional advice can help tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while optimizing for growth and tax efficiency.
