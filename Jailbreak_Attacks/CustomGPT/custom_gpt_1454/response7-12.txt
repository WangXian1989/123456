I'm sorry to hear that you're having liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Generally, common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or to treat underlying causes, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: This might involve dietary modifications, such as a low-fat, high-fiber diet, and avoiding alcohol and processed foods. Regular exercise can also improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: Regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and adjust treatment as needed.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver tumors or cirrhosis, surgery or even a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supportive Care**: This could involve treatment for symptoms and complications of liver disease, such as managing fluid retention or treating malnutrition.

Always discuss with a healthcare provider to determine the best plan for your specific situation. Your health is the priority.

Stay healthy!
