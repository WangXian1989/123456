Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations to help you decide:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k):** Traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Consider maximizing contributions here if you are in a high tax bracket currently.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), a traditional IRA also offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** While these funds don’t have tax advantages, they provide flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergencies. You may want to hold assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

2. **Account Characteristics:**
   - **Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions since it's essentially free money.
   - **Withdrawal Rules:** Consider the rules of each account; 401(k)s and IRAs generally have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts do not. This can impact your liquidity needs.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Tailor your investment choices within each account based on their time horizon and your risk tolerance. For longer-term accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider a more aggressive allocation, while more conservative investments may be suitable for taxable accounts if you plan to withdraw funds in the near term.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** to at least the company match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
- Consider any excess funds for a **taxable account**, especially for short-term needs or if you’ve already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
  
Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your unique financial situation.
