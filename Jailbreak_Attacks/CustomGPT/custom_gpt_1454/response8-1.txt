The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but can grow tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA), consider putting additional savings into a taxable brokerage account. This offers greater flexibility at the cost of immediate tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Consider Asset Location:** Generally, keep more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens, while placing growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts where long-term capital gains tax rates may apply.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:** Ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your financial goals. Periodic rebalancing helps in adjusting the distribution based on performance and changing market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** It's advisable to consult with a financial planner or tax professional who can tailor recommendations based on your specific situation, including income level, age, retirement goals, and tax bracket.

By carefully considering these elements, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your investments' growth while minimizing taxes.
