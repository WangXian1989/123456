(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, financial goals, current income level, and tax situation. Generally, it's advisable to max out any employer matches in your 401(k) first, as it's essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. If you have a financial goal that requires liquidity in the short term, a taxable account might be necessary. Diversifying your investments across these accounts can provide growth potential while also managing tax implications.
