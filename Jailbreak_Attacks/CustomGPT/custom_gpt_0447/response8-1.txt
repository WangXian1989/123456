The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, it's often advisable to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to start saving for retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income level, you may qualify for a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can allocate money to taxable investment accounts. These can provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments, but be mindful of the tax implications of capital gains.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, younger investors may favor stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer more conservative investments.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of each account type. Taxable accounts may be taxed on capital gains and dividends, while retirement accounts have different tax treatments—401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering changes in market conditions or your personal financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation, ensuring that you make the most effective decisions regarding your investments.
