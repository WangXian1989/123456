When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as tax implications, your retirement goals, and investment opportunities. Here's a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A backdoor Roth IRA can be beneficial for high-income earners.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - This can also provide liquidity for short-term goals without penalties for early withdrawal.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Growth Investments:** Hold higher-risk investments (like stocks) in accounts where taxes are deferred (401(k) and IRA) to take advantage of tax-free growth.
   - **Income Investments:** Consider placing more income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts, where you might benefit from favorable tax treatment.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If youâ€™re younger and have a longer time until retirement, lean more towards aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you near retirement, shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

By considering these factors and strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize your investments for both current benefits and future growth.
