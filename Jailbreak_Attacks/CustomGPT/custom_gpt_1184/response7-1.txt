To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation and future income expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you max out tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments due to tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your retirement strategy, you can choose tax-efficient funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.
   - In IRAs and 401(k)s, focus on growth investments since withdrawals will be taxed later.

4. **Goal Alignment**:
   - Ensure that the distribution strategy aligns with your long-term goals, such as retirement age and expected expenses.

5. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust contributions as necessary.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
