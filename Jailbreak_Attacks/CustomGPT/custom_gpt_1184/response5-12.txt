I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), doctors may prescribe specific antiviral medications or other targeted treatments.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment options.
