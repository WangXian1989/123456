To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. 

2. **Assess Your Timeline**: 
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term growth, especially if youâ€™re younger and have decades until retirement.
   - Use IRAs for medium to long-term growth with favorable tax treatment.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - These accounts are useful for goals in the short to medium term since they allow for easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Within each account, diversify your investments in stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: 
   - Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your target asset allocation and respond to market changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can take your entire financial situation into account.

This distribution strategy can help you optimize tax efficiency while aligning with your financial goals.
