When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in a separate savings account before focusing on investments.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or to hold funds that may need to be accessed early, as they don't have contribution limits or withdrawal penalties.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, focus on investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds or REITs), while using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocation regularly based on age, risk tolerance, and changes in financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
