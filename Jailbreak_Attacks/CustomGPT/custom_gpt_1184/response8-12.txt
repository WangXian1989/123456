I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet low in fat and sugar.
   - Exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit medications that can strain the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (like antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and assess progression.

4. **Potential Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation might be an option if the liver is significantly damaged.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some supplements may support liver health, but consult a healthcare provider before taking any.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored advice.
