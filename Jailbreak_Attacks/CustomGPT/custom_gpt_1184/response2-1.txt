When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**:
   - Pay off high-interest debts before investing heavily in any account.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a high-yield savings account before aggressive investing.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Use for long-term growth with a diversified mix of stocks and bonds tailored to your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar approach as the 401(k), focusing on tax efficiency. Roth IRAs provide flexibility in withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in lower-tax investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your distributions with your financial goals (e.g., retirement age, major purchases).

7. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can impact your taxable income. Plan accordingly.
