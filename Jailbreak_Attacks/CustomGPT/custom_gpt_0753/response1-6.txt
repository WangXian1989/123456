3. **Engagement through Influencers**: Collaborate with influencers who connect with this demographic to amplify your message.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use polls, quizzes, and interactive content to engage voters and make them feel part of the conversation.

5. **Events and Experiences**: Organize in-person or virtual events that are fun and relevant, making it easy to participate and share.
