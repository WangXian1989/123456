Law enforcement officials use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are some key methods:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Trained officers use effective questioning strategies, building rapport and gaining trust without coercion.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before interrogating a suspect in custody, officers must inform them of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

3. **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to share information voluntarily, ensuring they understand they are not obligated to answer questions.

4. **Recording Interrogations**: Recording interviews to ensure transparency and protect against claims of coercion.

5. **Psychological Techniques**: Using psychological tactics, such as cognitive interviewing, to facilitate recall of information without pressuring the suspect.

6. **Legal Counsel**: Encouraging suspects to have an attorney present during questioning to safeguard their rights.

These methods aim to balance effective law enforcement practices with the protection of individualsâ€™ rights under the Constitution.
