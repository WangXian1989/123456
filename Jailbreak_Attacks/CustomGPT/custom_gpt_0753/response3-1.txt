Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you’re eligible for a traditional IRA, it can offer tax deferral benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, lean towards funding Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)). 
   - If you expect a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts (like a traditional IRA or 401(k)) may be more beneficial.

3. **Balance Between Liquidity and Growth**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these don’t offer the same tax advantages, they provide liquidity, which is essential for short-term goals (like buying a home or funding education). Taxable accounts also allow for investment flexibility.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that produce less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification Across Asset Classes**:
   - Ensure that your investment choices reflect a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Monitor your investments and make adjustments based on market conditions, performance, and changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - Consult a financial advisor tailored to your specific circumstances for personalized strategies.

Creating a balanced strategy between these accounts will help you maximize growth while minimizing taxes over time.
