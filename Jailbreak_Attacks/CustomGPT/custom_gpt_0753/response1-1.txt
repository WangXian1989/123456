When distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductibility or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Balance Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for more flexibility and can be advantageous for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**:
   - Longer-term investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compound growth without immediate tax consequences.
   - More liquid assets can be kept in taxable accounts for easy access.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes in all accounts, adjusting according to each account's purposes and tax implications.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement to minimize taxes by considering which accounts to draw from first.

6. **Professional Advice**: 
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

Remember to regularly review and adjust your allocations as your situation changes.
