Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Aim to at least contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While not tax-advantaged, they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus more on retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments, possibly allocating a higher percentage here.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Hold cash or investments in taxable accounts for upcoming expenses or opportunities.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Spread your investments across various assets to mitigate risk.
   - Adjust the allocation based on your risk toleranceâ€”higher risk for long-term accounts, more conservative for short-term funds.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k) contributions** up to the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**, considering whether a Traditional or Roth is more beneficial.
- **Invest any excess savings in taxable accounts** for immediate access and flexibility.

Regularly reassess your strategy based on changing financial circumstances and market conditions. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
