(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, focus on contributing to your IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider using taxable accounts for investments. While they donâ€™t offer tax advantages, they provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: As you get closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments, focusing on preserving capital.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly assess your portfolioâ€™s performance and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

1. **Get That Employer Match**: Seriously, if your 401(k) is throwing free money your way, snag that match! Aim to contribute at least enough to max it outâ€”donâ€™t leave money on the table!

2. **IRA Time**: Once youâ€™re raking in that employer match, dive into your IRA. If you want tax-free growth, go Roth; if you want deductions NOW, hit up a traditional IRA. Just make sure you know your tax limits!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, cash in on taxable accounts! These bad boys let you access your cash without penalties. Great for future house down payments or spontaneous vacationsâ€”no retirement rules holding you back!

4. **Risk Management**: Keep your age and tolerance in mind. Younger? Go aggressive with stocks. Closer to retirement? Dial it back and keep things safer. Donâ€™t lose your real estate in the risk ocean!

5. **Rebalance Like a Pro**: Don't just set it and forget it. Check in on your investments regularly. If one account is taking off while the others are chilling, rebalance to keep your risk levels solid.

There you go! Time to get that money working for you! ðŸ’¸
