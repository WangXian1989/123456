Optimizing your investment strategy involves several key factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax considerations. Here's a general approach to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). The IRA often provides tax advantages such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free distributions in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit after funding your IRA. This allows you to benefit from tax-deferred growth and typically lower investment fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, as they are not restricted by contribution limits, and you can access your money without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your overall asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. For long-term growth, you may want a higher allocation in stocks within these accounts, while bonds can be used for more stable returns, particularly in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Investments in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, which can be beneficial for high-income years. In contrast, a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth; thus, placing higher-growth assets in this account may be advantageous. For taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts, taking into consideration how each type of account is taxed differently.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that takes into account your unique financial situation, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide customized strategies.

Remember, this is a general guideline and may not fit everyoneâ€™s circumstances. It's important to tailor your strategy to your personal financial goals.
