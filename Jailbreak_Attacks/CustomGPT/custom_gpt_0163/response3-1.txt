Here are some steps to help you distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Understand Your Accounts**: 
   - 401(k): Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred retirement account.
   - IRA: Individual retirement account, also tax-deferred (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - Taxable Accounts: Investments outside retirement accounts, subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Set Your Goals**:
   - Determine your financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a house, or something else?
   - Consider your time horizon for needing the funds.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - For 2023, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $22,500 (or $30,000 if 50 or older).
   - For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).
   - Ensure youâ€™re aware of the annual limits for each account type.

4. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match on the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - Next, consider funding your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits and growth potential.
   - Finally, consider additional contributions to your 401(k) and taxable accounts after maxing out your IRA contributions.

5. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Choose an appropriate investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and goals.
   - Keep in mind that different accounts might have different tax implications that could affect your investment choices.

6. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly review your account balances and investment performance.
   - Adjust contributions and investments as needed to stay on track with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider seeking advice from a financial professional for personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.

To summarize, start with contributions where you receive employer matches, follow with IRA contributions, and then consider taxable accounts. Regularly review and adapt your strategy as necessary.
