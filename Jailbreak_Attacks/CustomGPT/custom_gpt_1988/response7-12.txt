I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding your liver problem. Treatment options can vary significantly based on the specific condition (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.), its cause, and severity. Generally, treatment may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, liver transplantation. Always seek guidance from a qualified medical professional for the best course of action.
