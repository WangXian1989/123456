Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a good starting point.

2. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), focus on paying that down first, as the interest on that can outweigh any investment gains.

3. **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Generally, prioritize maxing contributions to your retirement accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if youâ€™re over 50). These accounts offer tax advantages that can help your money grow faster.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a taxable account for more liquidity and flexibility. This is particularly useful if you might need access to your funds before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Inside these accounts, ensure you're diversifying properly across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions as your goals and circumstances change.

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your specific situation.
