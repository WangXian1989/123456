Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account to help you determine the best approach:

1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to at least get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Assess the available investment options in your 401(k). They can be limited compared to an IRA or taxable account.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Consider contributing to an IRA, as it can provide tax advantages depending on whether itâ€™s a Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or Traditional (tax-deferred growth).
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs can have a broader range of investment options compared to a 401(k).
   - **Withdrawals**: If you need to access funds before retirement, Roth IRAs allow you to withdraw contributions tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may incur penalties.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Access to Funds**: Taxable accounts provide liquidity and immediate access to your money without penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Holding investments for over a year usually qualifies for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider holding investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

### General Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match.
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Next, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA(s), depending on your eligibility and financial goals.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional growth and liquidity.

### Final Consideration
It's often beneficial to periodically reassess your strategy as your financial situation changes. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your investment approach based on your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.
