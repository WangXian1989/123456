When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach that aligns with your financial goals and tax efficiency. Here's how you can effectively allocate your funds:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Concentrate contributions here first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA aligns with your tax situation. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Analyze Your Tax Situation:
   - Consider your current vs. expected future tax bracket. In some cases, it might be beneficial to prioritize Roth accounts (which are taxed now) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - Taxable accounts should generally be utilized for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

### 3. Diversify Investments:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks. Ensure diversified asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account according to your risk tolerance.
   - Calculate the overall allocation to match your investment strategy across all accounts rather than isolating each account's contents.

### 4. Consider Withdrawal Strategies:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s often advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Factor in your required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred accounts once you reach retirement age.

### Conclusion:
Combining these strategies will help you create an efficient distribution plan for your assets:
- **Prioritize maxing out 401(k) and IRA contributions**.
- **Diversify investments across accounts** while considering tax implications.

By aligning your investment strategies with your financial landscape and future goals, you can optimize your money distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
