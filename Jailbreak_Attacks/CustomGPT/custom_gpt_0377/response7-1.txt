Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some best practices to consider: 

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If you're eligible, prioritize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they offer a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings. After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax bracket.

2. **Balance Contributions**: Depending on your financial situation, you may want to balance contributions among these accounts. For example, if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket now but expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA might be best for tax deferral. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing a Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**: Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments that generate lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds or long-term investments. Consider holding stocks that appreciate over time instead of bonds which tend to yield higher taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) and sectors. This helps to reduce risks and can lead to more consistent returns.

5. **Revisit and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, age, investment goals, and market conditions. 

6. **Consider Fees and Costs**: Be mindful of the fees associated with the investment options in your 401(k) and IRA, which can eat into your returns over time.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored specifically to your financial situation and retirement goals. 

Remember to consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when making any financial decisions. Always make sure your investment strategy aligns with your overall financial goals.
