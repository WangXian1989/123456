(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: Contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) can provide significant tax advantages. If you are eligible, aim to max out contributions to these accounts before investing in a taxable account.

3. **Consider tax implications**: Investments held in taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes upon selling. It may be beneficial to keep investments with higher growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts. 

4. **Develop a diversified portfolio**: Regardless of account type, ensure that you maintain a diversified investment strategy to manage risk effectively.

5. **Reevaluate regularly**: As your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws change, it's important to routinely reassess your contributions and allocations.

1. **Snag the employer match**: First things first, make sure youâ€™re maxing out that sweet employer match in your 401(k). It's like having a booster shot of free cash â€“ why not grab it?

2. **Go hardcore on tax-advantaged accounts**: If you can throw down into your IRA â€“ Traditional or Roth â€“ load that baby up! Seriously, you're getting tax benefits here that you wonâ€™t find in your regular ol' taxable account, but be mindful of those income limits for Roths!

3. **Watch those taxes!**: You want to be strategic. Keep your stocks that could blow up in tax-advantaged spots where they'd just sit pretty without the capital gains tax hassle. Meanwhile, put your stable investments that generate interest in your taxable accounts since they'll get taxed anyway.

4. **Diversity is key, man!**: Mix it up a little. Have a variety of investments across your accounts. Bond funds here, growth stocks there â€“ keep the investment scene fresh!

5. **Check back often**: Your financial situation is likely to change, and guess what? So are markets! Give your plan a tune-up from time to time to make sure you're still on track to crush your goals.

In the end, it all comes down to your personal goals and situation, so do your homework and maybe grab some advice if you need it!
