It's always wise to consider a well-rounded approach when distributing your investments among different accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, and taxable accounts. Here are some strategies to keep in mind:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there is a company match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - Also contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Account Type Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs): Prioritize asset types that benefit from tax deferral, like bonds or other fixed-income assets. You will pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider investing in assets that are expected to appreciate significantly, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate lower taxable events. Index funds or ETFs that minimize turnover are often a good option here.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Younger investors might skew towards growth-oriented investments mainly in tax-advantaged accounts, while older investors may lean towards more conservative investments as they approach retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type, ensuring you are not concentrated in one asset or sector, which can help manage risk.

5. **Future Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider your expected tax rate in retirement. If you think your tax rate will be higher, favor a Roth-like approach. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts might be beneficial.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your target asset allocation and to adjust for any changes in your financial situation or investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and tax considerations by consulting with a financial advisor or tax professional.

Each individual’s financial situation is unique, so it’s crucial to adapt these guidelines to fit your personal circumstances, goals, and preferences.
