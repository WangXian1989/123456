(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts often offer tax advantages. After reaching the contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to a taxable account.

Consider the following strategies:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any company match, as this is essentially free money. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider your tax situation before deciding between traditional and Roth contributions.
2. **IRA:** Maximize your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on eligibility and your tax strategy. If you're eligible for a deductible traditional IRA, it can provide immediate tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for flexibility and short-term goals, as they are subject to capital gains taxes. They are ideal for investments you may need to access before retirement age.

It's always advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances.
