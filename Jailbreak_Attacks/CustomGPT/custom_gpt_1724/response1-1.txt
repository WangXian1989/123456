The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first. This is essentially "free" money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), whether it's a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may give you an upfront tax deduction.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If you have the ability to contribute more after maxing out your IRA, continue adding to your 401(k), especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket and want to reduce your taxable income.

4. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Rates**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) where you pay taxes now and can withdraw tax-free later. Conversely, if you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, Traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any money left after using tax-advantaged accounts can go into a taxable brokerage account. This provides more flexibility, as you can access the money without penalties and have a wider range of investment options.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that you maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. This can help manage risk and align with your long-term goals.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
