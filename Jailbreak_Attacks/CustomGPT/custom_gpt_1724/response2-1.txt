Distributing your money across different types of accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). These accounts offer tax advantages that can help your savings grow.

3. **Consider Income Needs**: If you expect to need funds before retirement, keep some money in taxable accounts. This way, you won't incur penalties for early withdrawal that may apply to retirement accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account. Traditional 401(k) and IRAs give you tax deductions now but tax you on withdrawals in retirement, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

5. **Diversified Investing**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different assets and sectors to reduce risk. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and performance to ensure you are on track with your investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially if your financial situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the best distribution will align with your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
