Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your risk tolerance, investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match since it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide significant tax benefits either through pre-tax contributions (401(k)) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: In taxable accounts, you'll pay capital gains taxes on investment growth. For short-term gains (assets held for less than a year), this can be higher than long-term capital gains rates, so consider your investment horizon when investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

5. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to pay that down before maximizing your investments.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**: Younger investors might lean more heavily into stocks for growth, while those nearing retirement may want a more balanced approach with more fixed income.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically check your allocations and rebalance if necessary to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can create an effective distribution plan that works for your financial situation.
