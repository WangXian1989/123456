Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key points to think about:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Consider maxing out employer match if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions (taxed upon withdrawal), while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement after meeting certain conditions. Determine if you prefer immediate tax benefits or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling. However, they offer flexibility without withdrawal restrictions. Consider using these for short-term needs or investments that generate tax-efficient income (like qualified dividends).

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings, as they offer unique tax benefits.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds needed before retirement, allowing easier access to your money without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Aim for a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering the types of assets (stocks, bonds, cash) and their expected return and risk. 

4. **Regular Review**: 
   - Revisit your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

By balancing these aspects, you'll be better positioned to optimize your savings and investments across your financial accounts. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
