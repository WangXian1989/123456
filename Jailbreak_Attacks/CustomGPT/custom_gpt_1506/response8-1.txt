Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on a variety of factors, including your current financial situation, your retirement goals, tax implications, and your investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you can. 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you are eligible for a Roth or traditional IRA, consider contributing to this account, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. The tax benefits can be significant.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can be more flexible and accessible, allowing for investments that may not provide the same tax benefits as retirement accounts. Use these accounts for short-term goals or for investments that generate capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts. This can help manage risk and provide more stable returns.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement as this might influence how you distribute your contributions now. Different accounts have different tax implications at withdrawal.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on the complexity of your financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your distribution strategy to your specific needs.

Remember, these are general strategies and the best approach may vary based on individual circumstances. Always consider your personal financial goals and situation before making investment decisions.
