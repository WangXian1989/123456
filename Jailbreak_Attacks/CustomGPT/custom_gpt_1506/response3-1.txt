Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, your contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawing funds at any time without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**: Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset types across all accounts. This helps balance risk and potential returns.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider your need for liquidity. Funds in a taxable account are generally more accessible than those in retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and your needs change, periodically reassess and rebalance your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the nuances of tax implications and personal circumstances, consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

By evaluating these factors and aligning them with your financial goals, you can create an effective distribution strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
