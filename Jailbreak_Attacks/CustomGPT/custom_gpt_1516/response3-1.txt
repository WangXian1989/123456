The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** (especially Roth IRA) offer tax-deferred or tax-free growth, making them ideal for long-term investments.
   - Prioritize these accounts for higher-growth investments.

3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional IRA or 401(k) contributions may be more beneficial.
   - If you expect higher rates, consider prioritizing Roth accounts.

4. **Balance Contributions**:
   - If you have maxed out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional funds to taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a mix of equities, bonds, and alternative investments across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes, often beginning with taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
