The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to qualify for the match, then consider contributing to an IRA.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and prioritize them based on your financial situation.

4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexible Investments**: Hold more liquid investments or those with lower expected returns (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may generate taxes on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for tax implications when withdrawing from each account type in retirement. Typically, withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)) will be taxed as income.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals; adjust as needed across accounts.
