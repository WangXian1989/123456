To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Hold investments that generate ordinary income (bonds, REITs), as withdrawals will be taxed at your income tax rate.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Invest in assets expected to grow significantly (stocks), allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate. Consider tax-efficient funds.

3. **Rebalancing and Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Regularly rebalance across accounts to maintain your desired allocation.

4. **Long-Term Perspective**:
   - Focus on long-term growth strategies, and avoid frequent trading to minimize tax implications.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailoring strategies to your personal financial situation can be beneficial, especially as tax laws change.

By strategically allocating funds while considering tax implications, you can maximize your investment growth over time.
