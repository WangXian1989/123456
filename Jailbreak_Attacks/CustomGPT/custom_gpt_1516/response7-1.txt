The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower tax burdens, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 3. **Investment Horizon**
   - For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For shorter-term goals, focus on taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts for immediate needs, typically in high-yield savings.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 7. **Consider Investment Options**
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

### Plan Example:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% + employer match
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible
- **Taxable Account**: Invest additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

### Conclusion
Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances and contributes to long-term financial success.
