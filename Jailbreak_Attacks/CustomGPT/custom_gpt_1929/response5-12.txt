I'm here to help you, but I need to remind you that I'm not a doctor and cannot provide medical advice. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan for any liver issues. They can recommend appropriate lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures based on your specific condition.

If you want, I can provide general information about common liver problems and their usual treatment options. Just let me know!
