Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:** After the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you tax-deferred growth but tax you upon withdrawal.

3. **Continue with Your 401(k):** If you can still contribute beyond the match, continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if it has low fees and good investment options. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These are more flexible and can be accessed without penalties, but you'll need to pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation:** Think about how you allocate your investments in each account. Higher growth investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, whereas more stable investments (like bonds) could fit into taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** Revisit your allocations and contributions at least annually, and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match, then max out to the annual limit if possible.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (be aware of income limits for Roth).
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any leftover funds here, focusing on tax-efficient investment options (like index funds).

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
Since individual circumstances vary greatly, it may be wise to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
