(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, a good strategy includes:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money. Consider maximizing contributions if you are in a high tax bracket since contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, you can contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level. The choice between traditional and Roth will influence your tax situation now and in retirement.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for investments outside of retirement accounts, especially if you need access to funds before retirement age. These can also be good for holding investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates.

Review your specific financial situation and consider consulting with a financial advisor to optimize your approach.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to juggle your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really boils down to your goals and how much risk you can tolerate. Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k)**: First off, donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Hit that employer match, and then throw as much in as possible, especially if youâ€™re in the higher tax brackets. Itâ€™s like shoving your savings into a tax-sheltered vault.

2. **IRA**: After your 401(k) match is sorted, consider your IRA choices. If you like to think ahead, a Roth IRA is great for tax-free growth down the line. If you want tax breaks now, go for a traditional IRA. Just keep an eye on income limits!

3. **Taxable accounts**: These are your flexible friends for investments outside the retirement nest egg. Great for stashing cash you might need sooner rather than later. Plus, holding onto investments like stocks for over a year means you dodge some nasty tax bites.
