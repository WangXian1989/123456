Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations to help you make this decision:

1. **401(k) (Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plan)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Investment Options**: Review available investment options, as they can vary in quality.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRA accounts generally offer more investment options than a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Contributions**: Funds here are already taxed, so growth is taxable only when realized (like selling stocks).
   - **Flexibility**: Money is accessible without penalties, providing liquidity for short-term needs or goals.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains tax implications when selling investments.

### Recommended Strategy:
1. **Utilize Employer Match**: Max out your contributions to your 401(k) at least to the match limit.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Fund a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, considering tax benefits and future needs.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for greater flexibility and potential investment growth.

### Ongoing Adjustments:
- Review asset allocation regularly based on market conditions and your financial situation.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

This strategy aims to balance tax advantages, growth potential, and access to funds while supporting your overall financial goals.
