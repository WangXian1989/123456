I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver treatment options. The best treatment for liver problems depends on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help liver health.
2. **Medications**: Treatments may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, or medications to manage symptoms of liver failure.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and scans to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.
4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In advanced cases, options may include liver transplantation or procedures to manage complications like varices.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
