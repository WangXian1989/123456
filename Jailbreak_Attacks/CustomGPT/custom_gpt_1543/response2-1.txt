When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to assess your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions. Pre-tax or Roth contributions may be available.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs providing tax-deferred growth and Roth IRAs allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Savings invested without tax advantages. Capital gains are taxed yearly when assets are sold.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Build Your IRA:** Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. The choice depends on your current and projected future tax rates.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** If you can still contribute after maxing the match and funding your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you're over 50 and can take advantage of catch-up contributions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Pre-tax vs. Post-tax:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA might be beneficial. If you believe your tax rate will be higher, consider a Roth option.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you anticipate needing funds before retirement age or want more investment flexibility, allocate some resources to taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Regardless of account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Monitor your investment strategy and account allocations annually or after significant life events (e.g., job change, marriage, or children).

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (max out for employer match)
- **IRA:** Up to the annual contribution limit
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining income for flexibility and additional investments

Ultimately, tailor your contributions based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
