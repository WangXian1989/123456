The best strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some considerations to help guide your decision:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) could be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals later. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, which can be advantageous if you're in a lower tax bracket.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits and prioritize funding this account to take advantage of tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your asset allocation periodically and adjust contributions as needed based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that aligns with your specific circumstances.
