Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA defers taxes until withdrawal.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce your current taxable income.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Understand how withdrawals from these accounts will impact your tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be allocated based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - If you have leftover funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility. Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review your allocations periodically and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can effectively manage your investments and potentially enhance your financial growth while minimizing taxes.
