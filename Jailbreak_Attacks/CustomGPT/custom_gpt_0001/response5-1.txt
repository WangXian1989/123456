The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that might generate taxable income, like bonds or high-dividend stocks. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) here.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, considering your risk tolerance and timeline. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Maintain liquidity for shorter-term goals since these funds may be needed before retirement.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and take advantage of market conditions.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your unique situation.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach considers your immediate and future financial needs, tax consequences, and investment goals. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your circumstances change.
