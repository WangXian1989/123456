Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for its tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA might provide tax deductions that are beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your IRA or 401(k)) to defer taxes.
   - More stable investments can go in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**:
   - Use your taxable accounts to offset gains with losses, which can lower your overall tax burden.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that each account is diversified across different assets to reduce risk.

**Suggested Distribution**:
- 401(k): Max out employer match, then focus on IRA.
- IRA: Consider maxing out your contribution limit.
- Taxable: Use any leftover funds for additional investments or short-term savings.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan suited to your specific situation.
