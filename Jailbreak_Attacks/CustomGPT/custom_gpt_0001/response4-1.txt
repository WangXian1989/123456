To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions, especially if there's an employer match. This account grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Choose between traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your asset allocation with your retirement goals and timelines. For retirement accounts, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts can be used for short-term needs, whereas retirement accounts should primarily be left to grow until retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type to minimize risk.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and adjust contributions accordingly to maximize tax benefits.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy to adapt to changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among these accounts.
