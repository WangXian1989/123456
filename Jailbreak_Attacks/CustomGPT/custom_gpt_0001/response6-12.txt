I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult healthcare professionals for liver issues. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol and high-fat diets.
   - Implement a balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests to assess liver function and health.

4. **Possible Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even surgery might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment.
