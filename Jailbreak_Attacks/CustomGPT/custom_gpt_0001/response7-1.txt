Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are general strategies for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contributions:** If you can afford it, aim to max out your contributions up to the annual limit.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limit:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year for tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer greater flexibility for accessing funds without penalties. Consider investing here for mid-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on investments like index funds or tax-exempt bonds to minimize tax implications.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize Tax Advantages:** Start with employer-matched 401(k), then IRA contributions for tax benefits, and lastly fund your taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments:** Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all account types to manage risk and optimize growth.

### Final Considerations
- **Financial Goals:** Align your strategy with your retirement and other financial goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailored advice can optimize your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively allocate your investments for growth while minimizing taxes.
