To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. It reduces your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investment Choices**: Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Order of Withdrawals**: Typically, itâ€™s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) in retirement.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - **Annual Review**: Assess your asset allocation yearly to ensure it reflects your goals and market conditions.
   - **Rebalance**: Adjust investments when they deviate from your target allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

Implementing these strategies can optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities over the long term.
