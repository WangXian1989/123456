Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible, considering the tax advantages.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial. If you expect it to be higher, a Roth IRA is more advantageous.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay within annual contribution limits to maximize benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for goals that might require access to funds before retirement, as they don't have the withdrawal penalties associated with retirement accounts.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy
- Start with ensuring you get the full employer match in your 401(k).
- Aim to max out your IRA contributions next.
- Use any additional funds for your taxable account, focusing on short- to medium-term goals.

### Considerations
- Evaluate your overall investment strategy across all accounts (asset allocation, diversification).
- Regularly reassess as your goals and market conditions change.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
