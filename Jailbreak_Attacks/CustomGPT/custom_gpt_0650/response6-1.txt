Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions; taxes owed on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for Flexibility**: These accounts offer more access to funds without penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Consider index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains with losses to manage tax liabilities effectively.

### Key Considerations
- **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for when you’ll need access to funds; typically, taxable accounts are best for short-term needs while retirement accounts are for long-term growth.

### Conclusion
The optimal strategy often involves a combination of contributions across all three account types, focusing on maximizing tax advantages while ensuring liquidity and future growth potential. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
