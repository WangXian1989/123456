Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Traditional accounts allow for pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income now, whereas Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversification**: Consider your investment options within each account. Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

6. **Reassess and Rebalance**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and evolving retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial picture. They can help you create a comprehensive plan that accounts for all factors involved.

This strategy can help you build a solid financial foundation and prepare for retirement effectively.
