Generally, it is advisable to prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA for its potential tax advantages. If you have maximized those options, then you can allocate money to taxable accounts. It's also important to evaluate the investment options and fees associated with each type of account.
