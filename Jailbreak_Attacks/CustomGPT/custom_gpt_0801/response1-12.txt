I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for any liver concerns. Some common treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or more serious interventions like surgery or transplant, depending on the severity and nature of the problem. Be sure to get personalized advice from a qualified medical expert.
