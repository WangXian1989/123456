Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually offers higher contribution limits and may include employer matching. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions; withdrawals are taxed as income. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts allow for more flexibility in withdrawals and investments, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains annually.

2. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine what you’re saving for (retirement, a house, education, etc.) and your time horizon for those goals. This affects where you should prioritize your contributions.

3. **Contribute to Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers employer matching contributions, ensure you’re taking full advantage of this before allocating more to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

4. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing any employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA if you qualify, particularly if you have a Roth option, as it provides tax-free growth.

5. **Evaluate Tax Strategies**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (either Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - Use your taxable accounts to hold investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or stocks you plan to hold long-term, to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversification and Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. For example, consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Monitor your allocations regularly and adjust based on performance, changing goals, or life circumstances.

This structured approach should help you make informed decisions about how to best distribute your money among the different types of accounts.
