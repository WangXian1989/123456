When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to understand the unique advantages and characteristics of each account type. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRAs**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement than it is now, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket currently and want to reduce your taxable income, a Traditional IRA may be a better choice, offering tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**:
   - A combination of account types helps you manage taxes in retirement. Having money in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) provides flexibility in managing your tax liabilities in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Short-term Goals**:
   - If you have short-term financial goals (like buying a home or funding a vacation), consider placing those funds in a taxable account. This allows for easier access without penalty, unlike retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation by Account Type**:
   - Generally, it's advised to hold higher-risk investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) because of their potential for growth and tax benefits.
   - Consider placing more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since they may be taxed at a lower rate or offer tax advantages.

6. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio**:
   - Periodically review and adjust the asset allocation in each account to ensure it aligns with your overall investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Each individual's financial situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice that takes into account your specific circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.

Overall, the best strategy will depend on your individual financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Balancing contributions across these accounts effectively can help you optimize tax efficiency and investment growth over time.
