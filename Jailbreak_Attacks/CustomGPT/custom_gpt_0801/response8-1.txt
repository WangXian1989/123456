Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), it's often best to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**: If you’re eligible, decide whether to contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free in retirement). If you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This often provides immediate tax benefits.

4. **IRA Contributions**: If you can still invest after maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider making contributions to an IRA, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions or prefer the investment options it offers.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short- to medium-term goals and offers more flexibility for withdrawals, though you’ll be subject to capital gains tax.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

7. **Tax-Efficient Strategy**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and those that generate capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize your tax situation.

8. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your strategy to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and market conditions.

As every individual’s situation is unique, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your needs.
