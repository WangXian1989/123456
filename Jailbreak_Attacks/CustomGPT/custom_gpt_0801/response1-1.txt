Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you have access to your money anytime.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - First, contribute enough to your **401(k)** to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider maxing out contributions to your **IRA** if you qualify, especially if you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, given its tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth.
   - Use your taxable account for investments that might generate lower capital gains or for more liquid needs.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

Thus, the best way to distribute your money often combines maxing out retirement accounts while maintaining some liquidity through taxable accounts for flexibility.
