The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, reducing your immediate taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Build a Taxable Account**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals, but youâ€™ll pay capital gains tax on earnings. They can also be beneficial for short-term goals or if you want to access funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Each type of account can hold different assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds), so tailor your asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for how you will withdraw money during retirement. Generally, you'll want to tap taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation, goals, and the market will change over time, so reassess your allocation periodically and adjust as needed.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your unique circumstances.
