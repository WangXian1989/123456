To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Good for high earners.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide potential tax deductions; Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed; however, you can manage when you realize gains.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term goals. Retirement-specific accounts (401(k) and IRA) are better for long-term growth.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they have annual limits ($22,500 for 401(k) in 2023, $6,500 for IRAs).

4. **Employer Match**:
   - If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors often opt for more aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while older investors may prioritize capital preservation.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes in each account to reduce risk.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds. Tax implications vary by account type.

Recommended Order of Contributions:
- First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA (consider a Roth if eligible).
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings or specific goals.

Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on life changes, market conditions, and financial goals.
