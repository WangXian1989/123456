Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. The tax benefits associated with IRAs can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is funded, return to your 401(k) and aim to max out contributions ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).

4. **Build Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and have additional funds, invest in a taxable account. This provides you with liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to access your money without penalties.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Place more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, and keep more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

6. **Tax Impact**: Keep an eye on tax implications for each account type. For instance, long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so consider where to place certain types of investments.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your contributions and account balances, adjusting your strategy as your financial situation changes.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your unique circumstances.
