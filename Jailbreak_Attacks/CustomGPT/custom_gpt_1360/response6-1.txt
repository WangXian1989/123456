To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs can provide tax benefits now, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, prioritize taxable accounts for investment flexibility and access without penalties before retirement age.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification Across Accounts**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to maximize tax-free growth or tax-deferred options.
   - **Asset Location**: Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid immediate taxation, while keeping equities in your taxable account where you can take advantage of long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. **Contributions and Withdrawals**
   - **Regular Contributions**: Automate contributions to each account type based on your financial goals and tax situation.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax implications, considering the tax impact of pulling from each account type.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions based on tax impact and investment strategy can help optimize your long-term growth and financial health. This approach provides a solid framework for making the most of your investments.
