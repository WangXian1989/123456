(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Prioritize contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, since contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Next, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA (or both), depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, you might distribute additional funds into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

Overall, ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)** â€“ First off, if your employerâ€™s throwing down matching contributions, grab that free cash! It's like finding money in your couch cushions. Max out if you can, especially since it lowers your current taxable income. It's the "set it and forget it" approach to retirement.

2. **IRA** â€“ Next up, hit that IRA! Go traditional for the tax deduction if you need a break now, but donâ€™t sleep on the Roth if you think youâ€™ll be cruising in a higher tax bracket later. It's like betting on your future self â€“ and who doesnâ€™t love a tax-free jackpot down the line?

3. **Taxable Accounts** â€“ Anything after that can go into taxable accounts. These babies have fewer restrictions, but watch out for capital gains taxes, which can sneak up on you like a ninja! But hey, you get flexibility. So, roll with the rhythm of your financial goals and find that sweet spot. And donâ€™t forget, sometimes a little risk can be your best friend!

Just remember, everyone's got their own jam, so if youâ€™re feeling lost, a financial advisor could be your compass!
