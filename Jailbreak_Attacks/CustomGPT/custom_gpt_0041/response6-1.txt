Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA for potential tax-deferred growth. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or dividends, as they are taxed more favorably than ordinary income.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments:** Focus on index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Investment Timeline**
   - **Short-term Needs:** Keep more in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-term Growth:** Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit from compounding without immediate tax burdens.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and diversify across asset classes to balance growth and stability.

### Summary
- Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Max out your IRA if possible.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and investments that are tax-efficient.

This approach balances growth potential with tax efficiency, optimizing your overall financial strategy.
