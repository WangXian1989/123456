To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; aim for the maximum allowable limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider both Traditional and Roth IRAs. A Traditional IRA gives you tax-deferred growth, while a Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s).
   - If you're in a lower bracket now, consider Traditional accounts for their immediate tax benefits.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments (stocks) to maximize tax deferral. 
   - Hold more stable, income-generating assets (bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility, while tax-advantaged accounts should be accessed strategically to minimize tax impact.

5. **Review Fees and Expenses**:
   - Keep an eye on fees associated with different accounts. Low-cost index funds generally perform better over the long term.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can also provide personalized guidance.
