Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is key to effective retirement planning. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. This offers tax advantages, especially a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the legal limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional investments, particularly for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. These are also suitable for investments that may generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Traditional accounts offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of account type, ensure your portfolio is diversified to manage risk.

7. **Review Regularly:** Periodically assess and adjust your distribution strategy based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
