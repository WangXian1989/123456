To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum to your IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Focus on allocating higher-growth investments (like stocks) here since you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Invest in assets with lower turnover, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate less taxable income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your expected tax bracket during retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, to potentially minimize tax impact.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Regularly rebalance your allocations based on performance, changes in financial goals, or shifts in risk tolerance.

6. **Consultation with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can effectively grow your investments while optimizing your tax situation.
