I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.

3. **Weight Management**: For fatty liver disease, losing weight can reduce fat in the liver.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
