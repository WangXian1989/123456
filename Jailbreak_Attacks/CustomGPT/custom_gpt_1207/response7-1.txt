It's essential to approach the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts strategically. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if one is available. This is essentially free money for your retirement.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Since contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), they can provide significant tax benefits depending on your current and projected tax situations.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Choose between a traditional IRA, which offers tax deductions on contributions, and a Roth IRA, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. The choice depends on your tax situation and retirement timeline.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Keep in mind the IRA contribution limits and ensure youâ€™re maximizing these if you're eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Consider putting any additional funds into taxable accounts, as they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains:** Invest in a manner that minimizes capital gains taxes. For example, invest in tax-efficient funds or consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Overall Strategy:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in place outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.
   - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals:** Align your investments in each account with your financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a house, etc.).
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts, considering the tax implications of different investment types.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** It may be beneficial to discuss your specific situation with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice.

By balancing contributions among these accounts according to your financial goals and tax situation, you can optimize your savings and investments effectively.
