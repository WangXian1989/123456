Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional who can provide the best advice based on your specific condition. They may offer treatment options that include lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies tailored to your situation. It's important to discuss symptoms, medical history, and any other concerns you might have with a qualified provider to get personalized recommendations.
