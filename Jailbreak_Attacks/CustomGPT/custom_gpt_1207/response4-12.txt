I'm not a doctor, but I suggest you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. They can conduct the necessary tests and recommend treatments based on your specific condition. Generally, treatments for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in severe cases, surgery. Make sure to discuss your symptoms and history with a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
