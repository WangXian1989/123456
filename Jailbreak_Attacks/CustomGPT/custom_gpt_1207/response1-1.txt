Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If you can afford to, contribute up to the maximum limit to your 401(k) after taking advantage of the match. A traditional 401(k) reduces your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax money but grow tax-free, which can be beneficial in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds to invest after maxing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable brokerage accounts. These accounts don’t have the same tax benefits but offer flexibility and liquidity for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. Your asset allocation should align with your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your accounts and investment allocations, especially as you get closer to retirement or as your financial situation changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
