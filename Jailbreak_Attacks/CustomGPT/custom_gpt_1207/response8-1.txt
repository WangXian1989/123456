The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts help you defer taxes on your investment gains. Aim to fully fund your IRA if you're eligible and if it aligns with your goals.

3. **Consider Taxes:** Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments. Depending on your taxable income, this could impact your overall investment strategy. Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments in all accounts are properly diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:** Review and rebalance your asset allocation across your accounts regularly to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Account Types Matter:** Generally, it may be beneficial to place higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (like bonds or cash).

7. **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before allocating significant funds to retirement accounts.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
