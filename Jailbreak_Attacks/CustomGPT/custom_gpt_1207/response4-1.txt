When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, consider contributing enough to get any company match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if you can since 401(k)s have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRAs**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional). If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for any additional investments after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. Taxable accounts offer flexibility but keep in mind that you'll have to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### Steps to Distribute Money:
- **Prioritize high-interest debt**: Before investing, ensure any high-interest debt is managed.
- **Emergency Fund**: Have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved in an easily accessible account.
- **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the company match, then invest in your IRA.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you have any money left after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate it to taxable accounts.

### Assess Your Goals:
- **Retirement Age**: If you're far from retirement, consider more aggressive investments.
- **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

As a final note, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution to your specific situation.
