To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following learning objectives:

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand the tax implications of each account type.
2. Analyze the benefits of employer match in 401(k) plans.
3. Evaluate the advantages of IRAs and taxable accounts.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **401(k) Accounts**: These are employer-sponsored retirement accounts that often provide tax advantages. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year they are made. If your employer offers a match, it is advisable to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts)**: IRAs come in two main types: Traditional and Roth. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, which can lower your taxable income. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Depending on your income and tax bracket, you may want to prioritize one over the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer the same tax advantages as a 401(k) or IRA but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Investment returns are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates when holding investments long-term.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy
- **Max out your 401(k) contributions** up to the employer match.
- **Consider maxing out an IRA**, especially if you can contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Allocate remaining funds to a taxable account** for liquidity and flexibility, particularly if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

### Exploration of Alternatives
1. If you are in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing a Traditional 401(k) and Traditional IRA may be beneficial to reduce taxable income today.
2. Alternatively, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA can provide significant tax savings long-term.
3. Depending on your financial goals (like purchasing a home or funding education), you might prioritize taxable accounts to maintain flexibility.
