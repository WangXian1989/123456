To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantage Accounts**

   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, maximize your contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**

   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate extra funds to a taxable investment account. This flexibility is beneficial for liquidity and investment options, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when withdrawing.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**

   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider:
     - **Stocks** for growth in long-term accounts (401(k) and IRA).
     - **Bonds** for stability, especially in closer-to-retirement accounts.
     - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little or no taxable income (like index funds or tax-efficient funds).

### 4. **Review and Adjust**

   - Regularly reassess your distribution and investment strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Key Considerations

- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type.
- **Withdrawal Penalties**: Familiarize yourself with penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
- **Tax Implications**: Understand how distributions from each account will impact your tax situation in retirement.

Following this approach can optimize your investment growth while minimizing taxes over time. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
