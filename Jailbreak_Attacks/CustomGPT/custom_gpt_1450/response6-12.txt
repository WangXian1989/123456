I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. However, common treatment options depend on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Incorporate a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limit or avoid alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Interventional Procedures**:
   - **Endoscopy**: To manage complications like varices.
   - **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver failure.

Always follow up with your doctor for personalized advice and treatment plans.
