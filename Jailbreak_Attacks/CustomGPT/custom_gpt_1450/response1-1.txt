To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income. This is suitable for shorter-term goals or emergency funds.

3. **Balance Investment Types**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically best for long-term investments. Use them for equities or high-growth assets, allowing for tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate stable or income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk. This may involve strategic asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation, adjusting as necessary to stay on track with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure, professional guidance can help create a tailored strategy that fits your specific situation and goals.

These strategies can help you optimize your investment and tax situation over time.
