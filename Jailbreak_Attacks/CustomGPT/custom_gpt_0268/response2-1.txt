When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines to optimize your investment strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the money you contribute until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choosing between them depends on whether you prefer to pay taxes now (Roth) or later (Traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized, so consider holding investments with lower turnover and qualified dividends here.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts. This helps in minimizing your overall tax burden.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, the value of your investments will change, so it's important to rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and adjust your strategy accordingly.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal financial situation and goals.
