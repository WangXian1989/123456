(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as they provide potential tax benefits. You might start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, you could fully fund your IRA, taking advantage of its tax advantages. Finally, you can allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts, which offer flexibility but may have tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific situation.

First off, get that free money from your 401(k) match! It's like finding cash in your couch cushionsâ€”don't leave it there! After you've snagged the match, throw as much as you can into your IRA because those sweet tax advantages can really help you out in the long run. 

Once you've maxed out those shiny tax-deferred accounts, then you can start having some fun with a taxable account. Just remember, with great power (or money) comes great responsibility; be mindful of tax implications, like capital gains hitting harder than your ex at a party. So, balance your approach based on needs, goals, and heck, maybe even your risk toleranceâ€”consulting a financial wizard (a.k.a. advisor) might be a smart move too!
