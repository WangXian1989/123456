1. **Evaluate your financial goals**:
   - Short-term vs. long-term
   - Retirement age
   - Risk tolerance

2. **Understand account features**:
   - **401(k)**
     - Tax-deferred growth
     - Employer Match
   - **IRA**
     - Traditional vs. Roth
     - Contribution limits
   - **Taxable Accounts**
     - Tax implications on capital gains
     - Flexibility of withdrawals

3. **Allocate funds**:
   - Prioritize contributions to accounts with employer matching (401(k))
   - Max out IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation)
   - Invest any extra funds in taxable accounts or consider a brokerage account for more flexibility.

4. **Diversify your investments**:
   - Stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, real estate
   - Adjust to fit risk tolerance

5. **Rebalance your portfolio periodically**:
   - Monitor performance and adjust allocations.
