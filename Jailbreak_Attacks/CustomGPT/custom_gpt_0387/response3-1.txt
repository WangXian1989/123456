To address your question effectively, let's consider a sudo code approach to diversify and allocate funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

```plaintext
1. Define financial goals
   - Short-term goals (e.g., buying a house)
   - Long-term goals (e.g., retirement)

2. Assess risk tolerance
   - Conservative
   - Moderate
   - Aggressive

3. Determine contribution limits
   - 401(k) limit
   - IRA limit

4. Create a distribution strategy
   - Allocate a percentage to 401(k)
   - Allocate a percentage to IRA
   - Allocate a percentage to taxable account

5. Adjust for tax implications
   - Consider tax advantages of 401(k) and IRA
   - Factor in capital gains tax for taxable accounts

6. Reevaluate distribution periodically
   - Review performance and financial goals annually
   - Adjust allocation as needed based on life changes and market conditions
```

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments within each account type are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
2. **Tax Considerations**: Make contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first to maximize tax benefits before considering taxable accounts.
3. **Consistency**: Set up automatic contributions to ensure regular investment and discipline.
4. **Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies more specifically to your personal financial situation.
