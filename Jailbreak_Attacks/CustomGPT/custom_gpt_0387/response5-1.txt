(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and current financial situation. Generally, a balanced approach can be effective:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Then, consider your contribution limit.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy. The traditional IRA may offer tax-deferred growth, while the Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may require more liquidity, and hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to reduce tax liability.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your specific needs.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s get down to distributing your cash! Here’s the plan:

1. **401(k)**: Dive in headfirst! If your employer's got a matching scheme, grab that full match like it's free ice cream. After that, max it out as much as you can since it’s essentially your retirement treasure chest and gets nice tax perks.

2. **IRA**: Now, pick your poison here. If you’re looking for tax-deferred growth, roll with the traditional IRA. But if you want that sweet tax-free growth for retirin’ like a king, the Roth IRA is your man. Make sure you contribute enough to avoid tax penalties!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these bad boys for anything else you might need quick access to. Think of them as your “just in case” stash. Plus, hold investments that don't get smacked with taxes every year. Get those long-term capital gains if you can!

Ultimately, let a financial advisor sprinkle their magic to fine-tune your approach!
