To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following sudo code approach where we break down your financial strategy into key components:

```plaintext
DEFINE total_investment AS USER_INPUT
DEFINE allocation_401k AS 0.5  // example: 50% of total investment
DEFINE allocation_IRA AS 0.3   // example: 30% of total investment
DEFINE allocation_taxable AS 0.2 // example: 20% of total investment

COMPUTE amount_401k AS total_investment * allocation_401k
COMPUTE amount_IRA AS total_investment * allocation_IRA
COMPUTE amount_taxable AS total_investment * allocation_taxable

RETURN amount_401k, amount_IRA, amount_taxable
```

### Key Considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. Max out employer matching contributions for 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Investment Horizon**:
   - Consider your investment horizon. If you are far from retirement, you might lean towards more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA.

3. **Taxes**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes or have long-term capital gains. High yielding assets, in contrast, are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts which usually impose penalties.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of IRS contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Adjust your percentages to adhere to these limits.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- Regularly re-evaluate your allocation as your financial situation or market conditions change.
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your personal circumstances.
