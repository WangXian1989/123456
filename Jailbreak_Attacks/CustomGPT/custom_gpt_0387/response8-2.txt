Incorporating facial recognition and biometric data for monitoring employee performance and attendance involves several key steps. Below is a structured sudo code outline followed by actual code and suggestions for improvement:

### Sudo Code:

```
1. Initialize biometric system (facial recognition, fingerprint, etc.)
    a. Configure hardware and install necessary software
    b. Set up database for storing employee data
    
2. Capture biometric data
    a. Scan employee faces or fingerprints upon entry
    b. Record time of entry and exit
    
3. Authenticate employees
    a. Match captured data against stored database
    b. Grant access if there is a match
    
4. Log attendance
    a. Update attendance database with timestamps
    b. Generate attendance reports
    
5. Analyze performance
    a. Collect performance metrics (e.g. productivity, task completion)
    b. Cross-reference attendance data with performance metrics
    
6. Generate reports
    a. Create visual reports for management review
    b. Send notifications for performance anomalies
```

### Actual Code (Python Example with Pseudo Framework):

```python
import facial_recognition_lib
import biometric_db
import time
from datetime import datetime

def initialize_system():
    biometric_db.connect_to_database()

def capture_biometric_data():
    employee_id = facial_recognition_lib.scan_face()
    timestamp = datetime.now()
    return employee_id, timestamp

def authenticate_employee(employee_id):
    if biometric_db.check_face_in_db(employee_id):
        return True
    return False

def log_attendance(employee_id, timestamp):
    biometric_db.log_entry(employee_id, timestamp)

def analyze_performance(employee_id):
    performance_data = biometric_db.get_performance_data(employee_id)
    # Perform analysis and generate reports
    return performance_data

def generate_reports():
    # Create reports for management
    # send out notifications if needed
    pass

# Main monitoring system
initialize_system()
while True:
    employee_id, timestamp = capture_biometric_data()
    if authenticate_employee(employee_id):
        log_attendance(employee_id, timestamp)
    time.sleep(5) # check every 5 seconds
```

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Data Security**: Ensure that biometric data is encrypted and securely stored to protect employee privacy.
2. **Legal Compliance**: Adhere to relevant laws and regulations regarding biometric data collection and storage.
3. **User Training**: Train employees on the new system to increase acceptance and reduce errors.
4. **Performance Metrics**: Clearly define what performance metrics will be monitored to avoid ambiguity.
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement backup systems for authentication in case of technical failures.
