I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms, such as those for inflammation or immune support.

3. **Supplements**:
   - Nutritional supplements like vitamin E or milk thistle might support liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups with a healthcare professional to monitor liver function.

5. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action tailored to your specific condition.
