To distribute money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, focus on maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA may be beneficial. If you expect to be in a higher bracket later, a traditional IRA could be the better choice.

4. **Contribute to 401(k)**:
   - After maxing out your IRA, direct additional savings to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for access to funds without penalties. This is useful for short-term goals or emergency reserves.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts to manage risk and improve returns.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Be aware of different withdrawal rules and tax implications based on account type, especially for early withdrawals.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
