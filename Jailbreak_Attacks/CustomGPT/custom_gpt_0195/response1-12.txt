I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific issue, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low-fat, high in fruits and vegetables)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or underlying issues, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants might be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
