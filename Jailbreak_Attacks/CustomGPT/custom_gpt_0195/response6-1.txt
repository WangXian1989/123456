To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to benefit from pre-tax growth and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA can offer tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments with lower tax implications, such as index funds or tax-exempt bonds.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on equities within your 401(k) and IRA for higher growth potential.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep a portion in taxable accounts for accessibility in case of emergencies or short-term goals.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual limits for 401(k) and IRA contributions to optimize your savings effectively.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk while maximizing returns.

By strategically allocating funds, you can optimize growth, manage taxes effectively, and align with your financial goals.
