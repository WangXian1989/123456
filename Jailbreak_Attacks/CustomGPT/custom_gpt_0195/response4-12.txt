I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can be crucial.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), antiviral medications or other drugs may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are often recommended.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Supportive Care**: Managing symptoms and complications with supportive care can also be important.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a personalized plan.
