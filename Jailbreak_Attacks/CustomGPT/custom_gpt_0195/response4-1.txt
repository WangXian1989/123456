Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax-advantaged growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Ideal for those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free. Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are great for flexibility. Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable, so consider holding investments that produce lower taxable income (like index funds).

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re younger and have time until retirement, you might favor riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) are generally better in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.

### Conclusion:
A good starting point might be something like this:
1. Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible.
3. Once those are maximized, allocate any additional funds to the 401(k) or taxable account, depending on your current tax situation and goals.
