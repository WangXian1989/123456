Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially “free money” that can boost your retirement savings significantly.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between them depends on whether you prefer tax-free growth (Roth) or tax deferral (Traditional). The annual contribution limit for IRAs is generally lower than for 401(k)s, so take advantage of this tax-advantaged account as well.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but they don’t provide tax advantages like a 401(k) or IRA. A good strategy is to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a Roth IRA) and income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Allocate Based on Age & Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors can typically afford to take more risks and may lean heavily on equities, while those near retirement should focus on preserving capital and might favor bonds. Adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions. This includes contributing to the underperforming assets to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial professional can be valuable, as they can help tailor a distribution strategy to your unique situation and goals.

Consider these factors as you make your investment decisions, and maintain a diversified portfolio to balance risk and return effectively.
