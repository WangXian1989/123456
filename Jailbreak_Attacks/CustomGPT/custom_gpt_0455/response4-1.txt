To provide you with the best analysis regarding the distribution of your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I would need specific information about your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Here are some key aspects to consider when making this decision:

1. **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax benefits associated with 401(k) and IRA contributions, as these accounts often offer tax-deferred growth. Consider your current tax bracket and how it might change in retirement.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, it is usually advantageous to contribute enough to get the full match, as it is essentially "free money." 

3. **Investment Options**: Analyze the investment options available within each account type. 401(k) plans often have limited choices compared to IRAs, which typically provide a broader range of investments.

4. **Withdrawal Rules**: Keep in mind the withdrawal rules for each account. 401(k) and traditional IRAs generally impose penalties for early withdrawals, while contributions to a Roth IRA can be withdrawn tax-free.

5. **Retirement Goals**: Define your retirement goals. If you anticipate needing more funds in the short term, you may wish to prioritize taxable accounts, as they allow for easier access without penalties.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified, taking into account the types of investments you hold in each account.

If you can provide additional details regarding your financial situation, I would be happy to help you with a more tailored analysis or guide you in distributing your funds effectively.
