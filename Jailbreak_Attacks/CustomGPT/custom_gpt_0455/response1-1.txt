Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Contributions Limits & Matching**: 
   - Maximize your contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to your IRA next, taking advantage of the tax benefits it provides.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, tax implications vary. With a Roth IRA, you pay taxes on contributions but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed annually on dividends and realized capital gains, so consider this when placing investments with high turnover or income.

3. **Investment Objectives**:
   - If you are looking for long-term growth, utilize tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA for investments with higher expected returns (like stocks).
   - For more immediate needs or short-term goals, a taxable account might be more suitable.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Consider how and when you plan to withdraw from these accounts. Donâ€™t forget about potential penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

5. **Time Horizon**:
   - If you're investing for retirement (20+ years away), you might lean more heavily into the 401(k) and IRA.
   - If your goals are shorter term, balance your allocation accordingly with more in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Make sure to diversify your investments across different asset classes, irrespective of the type of account.
   - Assess your risk tolerance to guide how you allocate funds among equities, bonds, etc.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy based on your specific situation.
