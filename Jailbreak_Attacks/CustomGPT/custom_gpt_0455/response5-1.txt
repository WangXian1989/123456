(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: IRAs and 401(k)s provide tax-deferred growth. Focus on maximizing contributions to these accounts first, as they can significantly help your long-term growth. For 401(k)s, remember the annual contribution limits.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Decide on an appropriate asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications on capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the type of account to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review**: Continuously review and rebalance your investments to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, so let's break this down! When it comes to distributing cash among your 401(k), IRA, and those dreaded taxable accounts (seriously, taxes suck), here's the lowdown:

1. **401(k) First!**: If your employer's offering a match, snag that free cash like you're catching a falling knife! Don’t leave money on the table. After that, hit your IRA with as much as it can handle next. Gotta love that tax deferral!

2. **Tax Efficiency**: Think about stashing high-growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts where you don’t have to worry about Uncle Sam sniffing around for capital gains. Your taxable accounts? Stick in the boring stuff or fixed-income securities to keep your tax bill down.

3. **Get Aggressive**: If you’re younger, don’t be afraid to take a little risk. Load up on equities in your retirement accounts where growth potential is sky high, while you keep safer bets in your taxable account—unless you’re feeling wild!

4. **Rebalance**: Don’t just set and forget! Check in on your allocations regularly. The market’s a wild ride, and you don’t want to end up holding the bag on some loser stocks.

5. **Personal Goals**: Ultimately tailor this to what you want—are you saving for a house, retirement, or just want to roll in cash? Adjust your strategy accordingly.
