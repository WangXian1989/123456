To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim for the max contribution limit ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. The max contribution is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2023.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any money you need for short-term goals (less than 5 years) should be saved in taxable accounts. This way, you won't face penalties for withdrawal like you would with your retirement accounts.
   - Investments in taxable accounts can be strategically chosen for tax efficiency, focusing on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

3. **Balance Growth and Risk**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance. Stocks tend to offer higher returns over time, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds may be held in taxable accounts to better manage interest income taxes.

By varying your distribution and considering these factors, you can optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency over time. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
