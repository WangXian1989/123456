Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be beneficial for flexibility, especially for short-term goals. Use them for investments that may generate higher taxable income, such as stocks.
   - **Asset Location:** Place investments with the highest expected returns in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax obligations.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, ensuring you manage risk appropriately. Consider your overall portfolio balance rather than individual account performance.

4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation while responding to market changes.

5. **Long-Term vs Short-Term Needs:**
   - Determine your near-term financial needs versus long-term retirement goals to guide how much you allocate to each type of account.

To optimize your strategy, it may be prudent to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations based on your specific financial situation.
