Dividing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon until retirement. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred, which is excellent for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are more flexible but less tax-efficient for investments that generate regular income, like bonds or dividend stocks. Consider keeping investments that benefit from lower capital gains taxes or are tax-efficient.

4. **Balancing Your Portfolio**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth, while those nearing retirement might prefer bonds for stability.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations at least once a year to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Each individual's situation is different, so it can be very beneficial to get personalized advice from a professional who understands your specific context.

By spreading your money wisely across these accounts, you can make the most of tax advantages while working towards your retirement goals.
