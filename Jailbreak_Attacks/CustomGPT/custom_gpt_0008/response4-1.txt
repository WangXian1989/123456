When distributing your money among retirement accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, along with taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to consider factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timelines. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have minimal high-interest debt and an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to have a lower tax rate in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deduction benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax bracket and future expectations, diversify between these.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for more flexibility but come with capital gains taxes. Ideal for short-term goals or when you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), you can afford to take more risks in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid savings or investments you may need access to before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Tax-advantaged accounts can hold more aggressive assets, while taxable accounts might contain more stable investments to minimize tax impact.

6. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your specific situation.
