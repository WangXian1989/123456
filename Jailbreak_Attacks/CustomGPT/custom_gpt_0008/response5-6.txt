Think TikTok dances, hilarious memes, and Instagram stories that make them laugh while learning about your policies. Use influencers who have a genuine following; it's all about authenticity, baby! And please, donâ€™t just talk about boring stuff; focus on hot topics like student debt relief and environmental issues. Make it exciting, interactive, and, most importantly, relatable. Get them involved, host some fire events, and encourage them to voice their opinions. If you donâ€™t make it fun, youâ€™ll be forgotten faster than a TikTok trend!
