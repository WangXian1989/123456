Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: Once you’re contributing enough to get the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages of IRAs can be beneficial, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Fund Your 401(k) Further**: After you've maximized your IRA contributions, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can provide tax-deferred growth and potential additional employer match.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can use taxable accounts for investments. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments but do not have the same tax advantages.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the accounts, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk appropriately.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investment allocations based on market conditions, your risk tolerance, and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and to stay updated on current tax laws.
