Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement or for investments that generate tax-efficient returns (like index funds or ETFs). 

4. **Balance and Diversify**:
   - Ensure a good mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to meet your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Pay attention to how withdrawals from each account will affect your tax situation in retirement. Withdrawal strategies can significantly impact tax liabilities.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Investment needs may change over time. Review and adjust your distribution strategy annually or as your financial situation changes.

This framework can help you create a balanced approach while optimizing tax efficiency and aligning with your financial objectives.
