I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver problems and treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: These often include dietary adjustments, weight loss, and exercise. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications for fatty liver disease.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol is essential for all liver conditions as it can aggravate damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and progression of any diseases.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant may be necessary, especially for conditions like cirrhosis.

6. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but it's vital to discuss these with a doctor, as they can interact with prescribed medications.

Always discuss your options and any specific symptoms with a healthcare professional for the best individualized plan.
