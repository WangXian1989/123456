Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before investing elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, growing tax-deferred. Consider maxing out your contributions to the annual limit.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). If eligible, contribute the maximum limit.

3. **Roth Accounts**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a **Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)**. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider opening a taxable brokerage account for flexibility. You can invest in a variety of assets without the contribution limits of retirement accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.

6. **Portfolio Diversification**: Distribute among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Respond to Changes**: Regularly re-evaluate your distribution strategy based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
