Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Max out your 401(k) contributions, at least up to any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After the employer match, maximize your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit).
   - Next, consider fully funding your IRA.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may have higher tax implications (like stocks or mutual funds) to hold for the long term, benefiting from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified within each account type to spread risk.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy:**
   - When you start withdrawing, consider your tax situation to minimize tax liability. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer, then consider the order of withdrawing from 401(k) or IRA based on your tax bracket at retirement.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review your allocation as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial planner may also be beneficial for personalized advice.
