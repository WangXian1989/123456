I'm not a medical professional, but I can provide some general information on common treatment options for liver problems. Treatment often depends on the specific liver condition diagnosed. Here are some potential approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A healthy diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt can help reduce liver strain.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoiding or reducing alcohol intake is crucial for those with liver issues.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral drugs may be prescribed.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: Conditions like autoimmune hepatitis may require medications that suppress the immune response.
   - **Diuretics**: These can help manage symptoms like fluid retention.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver failure, a transplant may be necessary.
   - **Endoscopic Procedures**: These can treat complications like varices or bile duct obstructions.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver health are often part of managing liver diseases.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan based on your specific condition.
