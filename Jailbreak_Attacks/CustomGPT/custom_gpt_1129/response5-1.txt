Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**: 
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**: 
   - If you qualify, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

### 3. **Continue Contributions to Your 401(k)**: 
   - After reaching the IRA limit, or if you're ineligible for a Roth, keep contributing to your 401(k), especially if you haven't reached the annual contribution limit.

### 4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and investment options but is subject to capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, it might be more advantageous to focus on tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k) and traditional IRA). If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts could be beneficial.

### 6. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**: 
   - Different accounts can have different investment strategies based on tax implications. Consider holding tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.
