When it comes to distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on lower-cost mutual funds or ETFs available in your plan.

2. **IRA Contributions (Traditional or Roth)**: 
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for investments that may produce high taxable income (like bonds) or short-term trading.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider stocks for growth and bonds for stability.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies** (for retirement):
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to let your tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.
   - Be strategic about withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts to manage tax implications.
