I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health. Treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition you're facing. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications for autoimmune liver diseases.
   
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet low in fats and sugars.
   - Avoiding alcohol and substances that can harm the liver.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - For severe liver damage, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.
   - Regular monitoring through imaging and blood tests to track liver function.

4. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some patients explore herbal supplements, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific case. What specific liver condition are you dealing with? That could help narrow down the most relevant treatment options.
