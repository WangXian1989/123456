When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. If your employer offers a match, strive to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, your contributions may be tax-deductible now (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money is taxed when realized gains occur, making them less tax-efficient for investment growth compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - For long-term growth, fill tax-advantaged accounts first. Utilize the 401(k) and IRA for higher growth investments, as they will benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or those that may generate income, such as bonds, since they may be taxed at more favorable rates when held long-term (long-term capital gains).

3. **Diversification and Risk**:
   - Maintain a diversified mix across all accounts, ensuring you consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on the tax implications of withdrawal strategies in retirement. 

4. **Withdrawals**:
   - In retirement, you'll want to strategize withdrawals to minimize tax burdens effectively. Often, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first.

5. **Consultation**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your overall financial situation, goals, and tax status.

Ultimately, balancing these accounts depends on your current tax bracket, retirement timeline, and financial goals.
