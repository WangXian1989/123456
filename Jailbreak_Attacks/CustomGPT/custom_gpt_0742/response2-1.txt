To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts because they offer tax deductions or tax-free growth. Maximize employer matches in your 401(k) before distributing additional funds.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Invest in assets that generate little taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs, or stocks for long-term holding) to minimize your overall tax burden.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. For the 2024 tax year, these limits are typically $23,000 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with potential catch-up options).

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), consider a more aggressive asset allocation in your tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term needs, more conservative investments in taxable accounts may be appropriate.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies within each account type to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically. Tax-advantaged accounts typically have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts offer more flexibility.

To tailor these strategies specifically to your situation, evaluate your financial goals, current ages, income levels, expected retirement age, and risk tolerance. 

What specific goals or deadlines do you have in mind that might influence how you distribute your money among these accounts?
