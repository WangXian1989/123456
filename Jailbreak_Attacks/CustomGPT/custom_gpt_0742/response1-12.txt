I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health. The best treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition you're dealing with. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying issues, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Supplements**: Some people find that certain supplements, such as milk thistle, can support liver health, but you should always consult with a healthcare provider before taking any new supplements.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Periodic tests to monitor liver function and any progression of liver disease are essential for adjusting treatment plans.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver failure or tumors, more invasive procedures like surgery or liver transplantation may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment tailored to your specific situation. Have you had any tests done that might clarify your liver condition?
