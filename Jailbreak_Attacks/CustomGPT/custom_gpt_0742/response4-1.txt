When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a breakdown of each account type that can help guide your decision:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to maximize this benefit; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). It's beneficial to reach this limit if possible.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and your investments grow tax-deferred. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Tax Deduction Eligibility:** Be aware of income limits that affect your ability to deduct contributions to a Traditional IRA if you or your spouse are covered by a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide more flexibility as you're not limited by contribution limits or withdrawal rules. You can access your money at any time.
   - **Tax Implications:** Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, but long-term capital gains (for assets held longer than a year) are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Strategy for Gains:** If you're investing for a medium to long-term goal, consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or capital gains, which are taxed at more favorable rates.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions First:** Contribute enough to get the employer match, then consider maximizing your annual contribution.
- **Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRA Next:** Depending on your current income level and future tax expectations, choose between a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** Once you’ve optimized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, utilize taxable accounts for extra savings and investments.

### Conclusion:
The ideal distribution depends on your personal financial goals, current tax brackets, and investment time horizon. It’s wise to periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws.
