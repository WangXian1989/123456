Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then consider maxing out if you can.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you're eligible; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - In a lower bracket, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and potential lower capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Keep enough liquidity in a taxable account for emergencies or short-term goals. 

### 4. **Investment Horizontality**
   - Long-term investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-free.
   - Short-term investments might be better suited for taxable accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored retirement accounts** for potential matching.
- **Utilize a mix of Roth IRAs and taxable accounts** for tax flexibility.
- **Review annually** to adjust based on changing circumstances or goals.

This balanced approach can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
