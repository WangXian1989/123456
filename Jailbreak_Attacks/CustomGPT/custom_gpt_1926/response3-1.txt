Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan with potential employer matching; contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax benefits; options include Traditional (tax-deductible) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages; investments subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - Contribute to IRAs based on their respective limits ($6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if you’re 50+).
   - Invest in taxable accounts once max contributions in tax-advantaged accounts are reached.

### 3. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Short-term goals (1-5 years):** Favor safer investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Long-term goals (5+ years):** Maximize growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Tax Strategy:**
   - Use 401(k) and IRAs for tax-deferred growth.
   - Hold bonds and other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Allocate stocks to taxable accounts for favorable capital gains treatment.

### 5. **Diversification & Risk Tolerance:**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts, tailoring the risk profile according to your financial situation.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your asset allocation periodically based on changing financial situations or market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your total investments.
- **IRA:** 10-15%.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10-30%, depending on liquidity needs and tax situation.

### Final Tips:
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique circumstances.
- Keep track of tax implications for withdrawals, especially as you get closer to retirement.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that leverages the benefits of each account type.
