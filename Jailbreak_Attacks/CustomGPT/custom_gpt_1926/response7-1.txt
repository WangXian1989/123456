The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can significantly enhance your overall returns.
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Evaluate how each account affects your current and future tax liabilities. Traditional accounts provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth.

4. **Diversify Contributions**: 
   - Depending on your age and retirement horizon, consider splitting contributions across all three types of accounts. Younger investors might benefit from more aggressive growth in a Roth IRA, while those nearing retirement may prioritize their 401(k) or traditional IRA for tax savings.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals. They offer more flexibility compared to retirement accounts.

6. **Adjust Based on Market Conditions**:
   - You may want to adjust allocations based on market performance or interest rates, especially in taxable accounts since they are affected by capital gains taxes.

7. **Periodic Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
