I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying causes.
  
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and managing weight to reduce strain on the liver.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant might be necessary.

5. **Supportive Care**: Engaging with nutritionists or liver specialists for tailored advice.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
