When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have access to a good 401(k) with low fees, consider contributing to it, especially if there's a match. 
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, think about contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain conditions.

3. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on distributions during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates and for funds you may need before retirement age without penalties. This can include savings for a home, education, or other major purchases.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency savings fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy based on changes in your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

7. **Diversification**: Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your unique financial situation.
