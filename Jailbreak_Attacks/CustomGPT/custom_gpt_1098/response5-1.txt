(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, you might want to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, which can provide tax benefits and help you save for retirement. 

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: This can further enhance your retirement savings and potentially provide tax benefits.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider taxable accounts for more flexible investments or short-term financial goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
