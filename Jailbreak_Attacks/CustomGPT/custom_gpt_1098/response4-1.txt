I'm not a financial advisor, but generally speaking, itâ€™s important to consider factors like your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance when distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Beyond that, you might want to assess your investment options and fees associated with your 401(k).

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income level, you may choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalty. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held in these accounts. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best meets your personal financial goals.
