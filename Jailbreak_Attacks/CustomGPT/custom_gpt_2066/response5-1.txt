Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts:** After maximizing the employer match, contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas a Traditional IRA might provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Invest in your 401(k):** If you still have money left to invest, continue contributing to your 401(k) to reach the maximum annual limit.

4. **Use taxable accounts for flexibility:** Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for investments. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility since funds can be accessed without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Consider your tax bracket:** Be strategic about where to place your investments based on tax implications. Higher growth investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments might be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance regularly:** Review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
