Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts.

2. **Tax Diversification**: Allocate funds to different account types to benefit from tax advantages:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income now; withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Choose between Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) IRAs based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals or investment flexibility; be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before aggressively saving.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and invest accordingly across all accounts. Typically, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where you wonâ€™t pay capital gains taxes until withdrawal.

6. **Annual Contributions**: Stay mindful of contribution limits for each account type and adjust your contributions annually.

7. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and goals.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
