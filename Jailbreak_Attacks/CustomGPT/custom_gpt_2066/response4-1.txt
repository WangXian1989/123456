Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA:** After maximizing the match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. This offers tax advantages that can aid in long-term growth.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** If you still have funds available, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for savings beyond these limits or for more flexible investments. Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts if you’re in a higher tax bracket. If your income is expected to increase significantly, a Roth IRA could be beneficial for future tax-free growth.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure that you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

7. **Investment Strategy:** Tailor the asset allocation in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

It’s recommended to revisit your strategy regularly and consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
