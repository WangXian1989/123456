To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) to benefit from tax deferments or tax-free growth.
   - After maxing out your IRA, continue to fund your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility in withdrawal and to take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - Consider investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

5. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can tailor strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
