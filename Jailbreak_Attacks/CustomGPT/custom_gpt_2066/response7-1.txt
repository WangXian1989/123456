Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**  
   Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**  
   If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts often offer tax advantages that can enhance your savings. 

### 3. **Fill Up the 401(k)**  
   After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**  
   Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These can offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Consider Asset Allocation**  
   Allocate assets based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, growth-oriented investments (like stocks) are better suited for long-term accounts (401(k) and IRA), while more liquid investments can be in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**  
   Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact, while holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 7. **Review and Adjust**  
   Regularly review your allocations based on performance, financial goals, and any changes in your personal situation.

### Summary  
The best strategy combines maximizing employer contributions, utilizing tax advantages, and maintaining flexibility through taxable accounts. Tailor your contributions based on your financial circumstances and goals for optimal results.
