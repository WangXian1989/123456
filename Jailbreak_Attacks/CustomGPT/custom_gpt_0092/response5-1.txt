Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Focus on tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax bracket. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds. Use them for investments that generate capital gains rather than interest to minimize tax impact.

**Investment Mix**: Diversify your investments within each account type, prioritizing growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific needs.
