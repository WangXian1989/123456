The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (if eligible) and then fully fund your 401(k) if not done yet.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: A Traditional IRA may offer initial tax benefits, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., stocks).
   - Keep bond investments or stable assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as your circumstances or market conditions change.
