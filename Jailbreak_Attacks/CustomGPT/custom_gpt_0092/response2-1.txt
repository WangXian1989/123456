The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (it’s essentially free money).
   - Consider contributing to the maximum limit if you can, especially in a traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**:
   - If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. 
   - A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

### Key Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund before allocating heavily into these accounts.
- **Tax Strategy**: Consider your current versus expected future tax rates. Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts.
- **Retirement Timeline**: Adjust allocations based on how close you are to retirement.

**Consult a financial advisor** for personalized advice aligned with your specific situation.
