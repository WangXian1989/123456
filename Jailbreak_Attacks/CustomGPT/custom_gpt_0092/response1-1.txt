To strategically distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out your IRA (either traditional or Roth) if you're eligible.
   - Once you reach the IRA limit, continue contributing to your 401(k).

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar benefits to a 401(k) for contributions, with tax during withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest after-tax dollars; you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Goals**: Think about your investment timeframe. Long-term investments may benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments to spread risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on market performance and your risk tolerance.
