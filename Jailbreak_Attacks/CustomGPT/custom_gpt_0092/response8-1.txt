Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify.
   - A Traditional IRA can reduce taxable income now, but taxes will be owed on withdrawals later.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement.
   - Utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**:
   - Hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA).
   - Keep lower-growth income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, Traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually or after major life events to adjust your strategy as needed.
