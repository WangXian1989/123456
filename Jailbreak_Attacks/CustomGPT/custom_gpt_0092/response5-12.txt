I canâ€™t provide medical advice, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized treatment for liver issues. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-ups with liver function tests.
4. **Alternative Therapies**: Options like herbal supplements should be discussed with a doctor.

Please see a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
