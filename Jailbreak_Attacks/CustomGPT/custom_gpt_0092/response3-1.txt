To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - Max out your IRA (traditional or Roth) after the 401(k) employer match.
   - If you still have funds available, contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Rules**: Understand that withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) may be subject to taxes and penalties if taken before age 59½. Taxable accounts allow more flexible access without penalties.

4. **Long-Term Growth in Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA, as these are tax-deferred.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are less volatile or for short-term needs. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

7. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your asset allocation strategy.

### Example Approach
1. **401(k)**: Contribute to employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds with an eye on capital gains taxes.
 
### Regular Review
Adjust your strategy as your income, expenses, and financial goals change.
