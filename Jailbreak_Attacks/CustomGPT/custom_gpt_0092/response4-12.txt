I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver issues. They may suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies tailored to your specific condition. Remember to follow their guidance closely.

Would you like to (type a number):

(1) Explore more about liver health
(2) Discuss symptoms and when to seek help
(3) Ask about general liver-friendly diets
