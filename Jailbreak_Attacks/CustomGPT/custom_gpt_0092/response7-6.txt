4. **Engagement Events**: Host virtual or local events featuring influencers, musicians, or community leaders that attract and mobilize young people.

5. **Peer-to-Peer Outreach**: Use networks of young volunteers for canvassing, phone banking, and digital outreach. Personal connections are powerful.

6. **Utilize Creative Campaigns**: Incorporate memes, videos, and interactive content to engage and entertain while delivering your message.
