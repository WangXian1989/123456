When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies for optimal growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers higher contribution limits. Prioritize this if you have limited funds.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access sooner without penalties.

4. **Investment Types**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Invest in growth-oriented assets since taxes are deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) and utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies.

5. **Rebalancing and Tax Implications**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio while being mindful of the tax implications when selling assets in taxable accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help optimize your specific situation based on your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
