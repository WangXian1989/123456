To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, plus an additional $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. The 2023 limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional funds into taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider focusing on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) here, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), but you might opt for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds, considering tax efficiency (e.g., favoring long-term gains).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, generally starting with taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your distributions based on changes in income, lifestyle, and retirement goals.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
