To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Focus on stocks in tax-advantaged accounts; they grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments like bonds, where tax treatment may be less favorable.

### 3. **Consider your Tax Bracket**
   - Maximize tax-deferred growth in 401(k) and traditional IRA if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts might be more beneficial.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to balance risk and potential returns.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**
   - Plan your withdrawals for retirement to minimize tax impacts; typically, start with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and personal circumstances.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
