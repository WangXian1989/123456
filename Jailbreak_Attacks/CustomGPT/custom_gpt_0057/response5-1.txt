Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This provides an immediate return and tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA for additional retirement savings. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions up front, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals later. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term investments or goals. They provide flexibility but come with tax implications on capital gains.

### Strategies to Consider:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings outside these accounts for liquidity.
- **Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix to optimize tax implications in retirement.
- **Asset Allocation**: Adjust based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### Consultation:
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
