I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A nutritious diet low in saturated fats and sugars can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial, particularly for fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or cirrhosis), specific medications might be necessary to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Limit alcohol consumption and avoid drugs that may harm the liver.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and make adjustments to treatment as necessary.

5. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In cases of severe liver disease, treatments such as liver transplant might be considered.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to get a diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan.
