To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as they often are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Higher risk may be suitable for long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan where to withdraw funds from in retirement based on tax implications. Typically, youâ€™ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k)/traditional IRA), and finally tax-free (Roth IRA).

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Reevaluate your allocations annually or after significant life changes to ensure they still align with your goals and market conditions.
