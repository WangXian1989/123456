I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications like antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests help track progress.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
