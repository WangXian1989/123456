Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maxing this out for tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now but tax withdrawals later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Keep an adequate emergency fund in cash or a savings account before investing heavily.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments and short-term needs. They can be good for tax-efficient investments like index funds.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Generally, stocks for growth in retirement accounts and bonds for stability in taxable accounts can be a good strategy.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Make regular contributions to each account based on your cash flow. This helps with dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation according to your evolving goals and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your strategy to your specific situation with professional guidance can maximize outcomes.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
