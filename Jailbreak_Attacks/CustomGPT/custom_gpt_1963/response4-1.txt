To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Bonds and Income**: Place bond investments in taxable accounts as they generate taxable income.

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of the tax impact on withdrawals. Tax-deferred accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts are tax-free.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation is balanced across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on market performance and personal financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
