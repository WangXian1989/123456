Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages. The Roth is beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that don't fit in tax-advantaged accounts or for short-term goals, keeping in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across all accounts, balancing risk and return based on your overall investment strategy.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations according to performance and changing goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
