Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, max out a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize traditional accounts for immediate tax savings.
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more to equities in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your goals.

By strategically utilizing the benefits of each account type, you can optimize your overall investment strategy.
