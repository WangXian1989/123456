To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, depending on the type.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (plus $7,500 catch-up if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments, as these will benefit most from tax-deferred growth. Consider higher-risk options if you have a long time horizon. 
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), prioritize growth. If your IRA is a Roth, consider placing higher-growth investments here, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or tax-advantaged income, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals from retirement funds, which can incur penalties.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes to ensure your strategy remains aligned with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.
