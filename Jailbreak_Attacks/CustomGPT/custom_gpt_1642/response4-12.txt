I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for specific treatment options for liver problems. They might recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or treatments specific to your condition, such as dietary adjustments, avoiding alcohol, or in some cases, surgery. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and follow your doctor's advice.
