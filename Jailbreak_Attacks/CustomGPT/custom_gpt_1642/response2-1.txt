To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Ideal for higher income brackets.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Choose based on your expected tax situation at retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. You pay capital gains tax on earnings, so plan investments to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced investment in diverse assets across all accounts with a focus on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account and hold higher-growth, tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

This structured approach can help you optimize your savings and grow your wealth effectively over time.
