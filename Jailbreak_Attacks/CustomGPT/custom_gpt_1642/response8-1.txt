Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement. Remember that youâ€™ll pay capital gains tax on any profits when you sell investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough savings in a liquid account (not tied to investments) to cover unexpected expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of where you invest, diversify your portfolio to spread risk. This means holding a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.

5. **Retirement Horizon**: The closer you are to retirement, the more you might want to shift towards stability (bonds, conservative investments) from aggressive growth (stocks).

6. **Ongoing Contributions**: Regularly contribute to each account type, adjusting based on your overall strategy and any changes in income or expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, it may be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

Ultimately, your distribution strategy should align with your risk tolerance and financial goals for both retirement and any other life stages.
