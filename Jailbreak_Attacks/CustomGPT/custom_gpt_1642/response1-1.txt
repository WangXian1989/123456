Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions subject to annual limits.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible. It offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and can serve as an emergency fund or for short-term goals.

### Suggested Strategy:

- **Max out employer match in 401(k)**.
- **Contribute to an IRA up to the limit**.
- **Invest remaining funds in a taxable account** for liquidity and diversification.

### General Tips:

- **Assess risk tolerance** and investment goals.
- **Rebalance periodically** to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a financial advisor** for personalized advice based on your financial situation.

Always consider tax implications and long-term goals when deciding how to allocate your investments.
