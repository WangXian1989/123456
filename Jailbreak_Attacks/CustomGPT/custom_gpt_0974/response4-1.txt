Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some points to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **Distributions**: Money in a 401(k) grows tax-deferred until withdrawal. Consider maxing out contributions, especially to take full advantage of any employer match.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Type of IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals if qualified).
   - **Benefits**: Both accounts offer tax advantages, with IRAs typically having more investment options than 401(k)s. If you qualify, a Roth IRA may be beneficial for long-term tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages but allow for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains**: You will owe taxes on dividends and capital gains, but holding investments for over a year can qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA, especially a Roth if you qualify, for additional tax-advantaged growth.
- **Back to the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, redirect funds back to your 401(k) to continue benefiting from tax-deferred growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you have funds left to invest, consider putting them into a taxable account for flexibility and access.

### Tailoring Your Approach:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and comfort level with risk should influence how much you allocate to each account type. Younger investors may opt for more aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement might shift towards conservative options.
- **Monitoring and Adjusting**: Regularly reviewing your investment strategy and adjusting your allocations based on performance and changing goals is essential.

### Consultation:
- **Financial Advisor**: It could be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor, who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation and financial goals.

This balanced approach can help you take advantage of each account type's benefits while managing your overall investment strategy effectively.
