Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRA contributions are made after taxes, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes and can hold various investments. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Prioritize Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA could be beneficial for tax-free growth.
   - Next, invest in your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially if you need flexibility or if you have maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, balancing risk according to your timeline and financial goals. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance them as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor, especially for specific tax strategies or complex situations.

Consider your individual circumstances, including your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance, when making decisions about account distribution.
