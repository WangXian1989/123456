I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary significantly depending on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. Always prioritize getting professional medical advice for your health concerns.
