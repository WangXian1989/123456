To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions in your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts First**: Consider maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, such as a 401(k) and IRA, before putting money into taxable accounts. The contribution limits for these accounts can provide significant tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as 401(k) contributions; withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends may be taxed, so consider placing investments with high turnover or those likely to incur taxes into tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. More aggressive investments (like stocks) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments (like bonds) might be suitable for taxable accounts.

5. **Plan for Future Withdrawals**: Consider your expected retirement income needs. You might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts for a longer period.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation and market conditions change over time. Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals.

Before making any decisions, you may want to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your particular financial situation and retirement objectives.
