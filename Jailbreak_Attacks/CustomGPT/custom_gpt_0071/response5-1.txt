When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This account grows tax-deferred, which is beneficial for long-term growth.

2. **IRA:** Consider both Traditional and Roth IRAs. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribute to whichever aligns with your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are more flexible and can provide liquidity for shorter-term goals. Use them for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or dividends, as they can incur higher taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:

- **Prioritize 401(k) for matching contributions.**
- **Contribute to an IRA next for tax advantages.**
- **Use taxable accounts for additional savings and liquidity.**

### Additional Tips:

- **Diversify investments across all accounts.**
- **Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.**
- **Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.**
