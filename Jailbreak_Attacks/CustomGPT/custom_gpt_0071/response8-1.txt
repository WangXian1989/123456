Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions if your income allows, especially for a Roth IRA if you qualify. Gains grow tax-free (Roth) or tax-deferred (Traditional).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in assets that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Favor tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Maintain more accessible funds in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to manage risk.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, manage tax implications in taxable accounts, and balance your overall investment strategy.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
