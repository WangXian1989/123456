To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, either traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (bonds or dividends) due to potentially lower tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes in each account to balance risk.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications during retirement to minimize taxes when withdrawing funds.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations periodically and adjust based on market performance and changing goals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals.
