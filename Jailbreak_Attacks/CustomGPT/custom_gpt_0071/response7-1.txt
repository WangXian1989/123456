To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Focus on contributing enough to get any employer matches first, as this is essentially "free money." Maximize contributions if possible, especially if your tax bracket is higher.

2. **IRA**: Prioritize a Traditional IRA for tax benefits if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Consider a Roth IRA if you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement and anticipate being in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may offer lower tax rates, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. This can be a good place for funds you might need access to before retirement age.

### General Guidelines:

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a safety net of 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes within each account to mitigate risk.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of the tax implications associated with each account type, and consider tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
