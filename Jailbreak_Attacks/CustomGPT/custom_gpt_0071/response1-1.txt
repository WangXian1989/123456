To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing this out if you have a solid employer match.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA for tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth, respectively.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility, especially if you might need access to your money before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon within each account.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains and income tax implications when withdrawing from taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insight based on your specific situation.
