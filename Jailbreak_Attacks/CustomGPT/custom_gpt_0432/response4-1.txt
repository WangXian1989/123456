To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers tax-deferred growth. Focus on high-growth investments here.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals. Your choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for funds you may need in the short term or for holding investments that generate lower tax rates (like qualified dividends).

3. **Asset Allocation**: Line up your risk tolerance and investment goals with your accounts. You might want higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and safer or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts. Understand penalties and tax implications for early withdrawals and strategize for retirement spending to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts by periodically rebalancing.

6. **Consider Fees**: Be aware of the fees associated with your 401(k) and investment options in each account, as this can affect long-term growth.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals for the best outcomes.

Always review your distribution strategy annually or after major life changes.
