Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guide:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Roth or Traditional) for additional tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings after your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While you won't get a tax break for contributions, long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to a selection of funds; choose a diversified mix suitable for your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers more investment choices than a 401(k). Consider using index funds or ETFs for low fees.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you might want to access before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors may want to take more risks in growth-focused investments.
   - As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

**Example Distribution**:
- If you’re in your 30s, you might allocate:
  - 401(k): 10% of salary (up to match)
  - Roth IRA: $6,500 (2023 limit)
  - Taxable Account: Remaining savings.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach tailored to your individual circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
