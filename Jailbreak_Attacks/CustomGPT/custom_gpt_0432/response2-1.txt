Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can enhance your financial growth and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs).
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts may be more beneficial.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax on interest income.

4. **Consider Liquidity Needs:**
   - Taxable accounts typically allow for more liquidity. Keep enough cash or easily liquidated assets here for short-term needs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Tax-Loss Harvesting:**
   - In taxable accounts, consider selling underperforming investments to offset capital gains and reduce taxable income.

7. **Long-Term Strategy:**
   - Focus on long-term growth rather than short-term fluctuations, and stick to your investment plan.

Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
