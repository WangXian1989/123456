When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. Maximize your contributions in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) first, especially if you have an employer match in your 401(k).

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions depending on your income.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. 
   - Consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate significant taxable income (like bonds or high-yield investments) and hold long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

5. **Review Tax Bracket**: Keep your current and expected future tax brackets in mind. In higher brackets, tax-advantaged accounts can save you significant amounts since the growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.

6. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts in line with your long-term financial goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your individual financial situation and goals.

In summary, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, allocate investments strategically based on tax implications, and review your portfolio regularly.
