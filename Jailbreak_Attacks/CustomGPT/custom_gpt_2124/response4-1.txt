Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to a tax-advantaged account like an IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs typically offer immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Contributions Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, for example, the maximum contribution to a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if over age 50), and for an IRA, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50).

4. **Tax Liabilities**: Funds in a 401(k) and IRAs grow tax-deferred, meaning you only pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement, while taxable accounts require you to pay capital gains taxes on profits. Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding where to allocate funds.

5. **Asset Allocation Based on Time Horizon**: If you have a longer investment horizon, you may want to be more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts, potentially investing in stocks or other growth-oriented investments. In taxable accounts, consider investing in more stable assets due to potential tax implications.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies. This ensures you can access funds without penalties.

7. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

8. **Consult a Professional**: Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and circumstances.

It's critical to evaluate your unique situation, as the best approach will vary based on individual financial goals and tax implications.
