I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you could discuss with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and losing weight if overweight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may help reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating any underlying conditions, such as diabetes or high cholesterol.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment options.
