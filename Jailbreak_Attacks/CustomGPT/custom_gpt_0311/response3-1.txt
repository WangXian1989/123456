Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match first, then consider maxing it out if possible.
   - **IRA**: Once you've funded your 401(k) to the match, contribute to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. This can include:
   - Emergency savings
   - Short-term savings goals
   - Investments in assets that are more tax-efficient, like index funds.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed on withdrawal.
   - Roth contributions are after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when assets are sold.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help you optimize your distributions based on your unique financial situation.

This strategy focuses on balancing immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential.
