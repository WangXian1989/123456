Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively is essential for a balanced investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help you decide the best allocation:

### 1. Understand the Tax Implications
- **401(k)**: Contributions are often made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more liquidity and flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

### 2. Consider Contribution Limits
- **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's effectively free money.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Fund your IRA up to the maximum limit, which can help with tax diversification.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 3. Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals
- **Age and Retirement Goals**: The further you are from retirement, the higher the risk you can typically tolerate. Younger investors may lean towards stocks in taxable accounts for growth.
- **Asset Allocation**: Allocate funds based on your risk profile across all accounts. For example, consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### General Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Aim for 15-20% of your income, especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum annual limit if feasible, starting with a Roth if you qualify for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for both immediate needs and longer-term investments after maximizing the tax-advantaged accounts.

### Summary
- **Tax Considerations**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to reduce current tax liability while keeping flexibility in taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a broad asset allocation strategy that reflects your risk tolerance across all account types.
