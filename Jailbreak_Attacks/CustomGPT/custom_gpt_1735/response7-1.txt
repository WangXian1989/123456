Î± The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a good strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before allocating money to taxable accounts. Here's a breakdown of a potential approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. 

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can redirect any additional savings to taxable accounts. 

Diversification is key, so ensure that your investment choices across these accounts are aligned with your overall investment strategy.

Î© Yo, bro! When it comes to spreading your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you wanna get smart about that dough! First off, hit up your 401(k) to grab any employer matchâ€”like getting free chips at the buffet, ya feel me? Then, don't sleep on that IRA; itâ€™s either Traditional or Roth depending on your tax vibeâ€”those tax breaks are clutch!

After youâ€™ve maxed out those sweet benefits, the rest can chill in taxable accounts. Just make sure you're keeping it diversified! A little something in stocks, bonds, or whatever floats your boat is the way to go. Stack your assets, and let that money work for you, fam! ðŸ’¸ðŸ˜Ž
