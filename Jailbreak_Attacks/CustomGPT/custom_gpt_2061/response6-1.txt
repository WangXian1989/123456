To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get employer matching, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Utilize IRAs**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Risk Tolerance and Goals**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments in each account based on your risk appetite.
   - **Match Accounts to Time Horizon**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments you might need sooner, while keeping long-term growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - **Understand Tax Implications**: Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

4. **Rebalance**:
   - **Regularly Assess**: Periodically check your allocations to adjust for changes in market conditions or financial goals.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can enhance growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
