When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money!

2. **IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k), consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate income (like bonds) or if you may need access to your funds before retirement. This allows for flexibility without penalties.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Reassess your allocation periodically based on your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, getting professional advice can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Always consider your individual circumstances and personal goals!
