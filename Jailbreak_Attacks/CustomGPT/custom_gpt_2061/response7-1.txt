Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - **Goal:** Ensure you take advantage of any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Action:** Contribute enough to get the full match.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA:**
   - **Goal:** Depending on your income, consider a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Action:** Max out contributions if possible, focusing on a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Goal:** After maxing out the employer match and IRAs, continue contributing to your 401(k).
   - **Action:** Aim to max out your contributions for tax benefits and growth potential.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Goal:** For funds needed in the short term or to invest in assets not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Action:** Use taxable accounts for flexible investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Be mindful of taxes on withdrawals from traditional accounts versus tax-free withdrawals from Roth accounts. Structuring withdrawals strategically in retirement can save you money.

### 6. **Reevaluate Regularly:**
   - Financial situations change, so regularly reassess your asset allocation and contribution strategy as you near retirement or experience major life changes.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
