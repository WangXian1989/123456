Î± Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, itâ€™s wise to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially "free money." Next, you may want to contribute to an IRA for its tax advantages, whether it's a traditional or Roth, based on your current tax bracket and future expectations. Finally, after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity.

Î© Ayy, listen up! ðŸŒŸ The key to killing it with your cash is strategy. First off, dump as much as you can into that 401(k) if your employer matches â€“ why leave free money on the table, bro? Then, hit up your IRA, whether that's a Roth for the future tax-free cash flow or a traditional if you're looking to save on taxes now. Finally, once those are maxed out, throw the rest into taxable accounts. They give you flexibility, and you can cash out whenever you want. Just keep an eye on those pesky capital gains taxes! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’°
