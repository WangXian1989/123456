I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes like improving diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and exercising. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific condition, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis. In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be considered.

For a more tailored approach, consulting a healthcare professional is essential. They can provide a specific diagnosis and develop a treatment plan based on your individual needs and medical history.
