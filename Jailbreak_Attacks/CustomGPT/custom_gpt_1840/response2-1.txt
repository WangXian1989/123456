Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to at least get the employer match, then consider increasing contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for a traditional or Roth IRA, consider contributing after your 401(k) contributions, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket and can benefit from a tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds into taxable accounts for more flexibility in accessing your money without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth contributions (tax-free growth and withdrawals) over traditional contributions.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Revisit Annually**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

The right balance will depend on your individual situation, so make sure to assess your goals and possibly consult with a financial professional.
