The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great place to start.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing your employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Distributing more funds into your tax-deferred accounts (like Traditional IRAs or 401(k)s) can provide immediate tax benefits. On the other hand, funds in a taxable account need to be considered for capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Diversification of Accounts**: It's often good to have a mix of tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in retirement when managing withdrawals and tax liabilities.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes and as you approach retirement age.

Finally, itâ€™s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored to your personal financial situation. ðŸŽ‰ðŸ“ˆ
