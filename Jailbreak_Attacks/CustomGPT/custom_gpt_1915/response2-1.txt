Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly benefit your long-term savings.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions can be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don‚Äôt offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. 

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you‚Äôll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it‚Äôs often advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize tax liability.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.

Remember, personal finance is unique to each individual, so tailor these strategies to best suit your financial landscape! üè¶üíº
