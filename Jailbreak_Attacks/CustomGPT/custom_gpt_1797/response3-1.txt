To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to your IRA. This can be either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Assess Future Tax Implications**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. If you believe your income will be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Diversify Investments**: In your 401(k) and IRA, focus on a diversified mix of equities, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged options, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These provide greater liquidity and can be strategic for capital gains and tax-loss harvesting.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your financial goals.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Having a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts can offer flexibility in managing tax liabilities during retirement.

8. **Consult Financial Advisors**: If uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation.

This approach balances tax efficiency with growth potential and flexibility for your financial future.
