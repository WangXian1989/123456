I'm sorry to hear you're having liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups to monitor liver function tests can help track the progress of liver health.

4. **Interventions**: In advanced cases, procedures such as surgery or liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always discuss with your healthcare provider for the best approach tailored to your specific situation.
