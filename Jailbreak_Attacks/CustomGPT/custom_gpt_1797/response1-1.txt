Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially "free money." If you can, max out contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. A Traditional IRA may be beneficial if you want to reduce taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexible investing and to tap into without penalties. They're best for holding assets that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are spread across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
