Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
- **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. Prioritize Tax-Efficient Investing
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account. Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting and invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize your tax burden.

### 3. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- Lower your taxable income with 401(k) and IRA contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 4. Factor in Your Retirement Timeline
- If retirement is far off, prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
- As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards safer investments in these accounts while tapping into taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 5. Reassess Regularly
- Regularly revisit your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor
- For personalized strategies, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan to your situation.

This strategy balances tax efficiency and potential growth while aiming to meet your financial goals.
