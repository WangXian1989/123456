To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**: 401(k) and IRA contributions may offer tax advantages. For example, traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions can reduce your taxable income, while Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) compared to your IRA and taxable accounts. Sometimes, employer-sponsored plans have limited investment choices, whereas IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options.

4. **Withdrawal Rules**: Understand the rules for withdrawals from each account type, as they vary. Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts are taxed as ordinary income, and early withdrawals may incur penalties. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals of contributions at any time.

5. **Fees and Costs**: Look into the fees associated with managing each of your accounts. This includes administrative fees for your 401(k) plan and any trading fees in your IRA or taxable accounts.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across account types according to your overall financial strategy, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

A balanced approach could involve maxing out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of employer matches, then contributing enough to your IRA to benefit from tax advantages, with any additional investments going into taxable accounts for flexibility. 

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation and goals.
