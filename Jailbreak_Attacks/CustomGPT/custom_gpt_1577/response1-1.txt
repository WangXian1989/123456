The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for needing the funds. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. 

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains. Use this account for investments that generate lower tax liabilities or are held for the long term.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you're diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. This can help manage risk and improve potential returns over time.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund of about 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a liquid account.

5. **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors may lean more towards aggressive investments in retirement accounts. As you age, shift towards more conservative investments to protect your savings.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Keep in mind that your distribution strategy should evolve as your financial situation and goals change. It’s always good to review and adjust your allocations periodically.
