To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Overview of Account Types
1. **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Offers tax-deferred growth.
2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Allows for tax-deferred or tax-free growth depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts that provide flexibility, but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### Distribution Strategies

#### 1. Maximize Contributions
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for at least 15% of your salary if possible.
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after handling your 401(k) to benefit from tax advantages.

#### 2. Diversification of Assets
- **Tax-advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on higher-growth investments like stocks since the taxes are deferred.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

#### 3. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals later.
- If you're currently in a higher tax bracket, a traditional 401(k) or IRA might be more beneficial for tax deferral.

#### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation across all accounts, ensuring risk management and investment growth.

By carefully considering your contributions and investment strategy, you can maximize your retirement savings and ensure tax efficiency across all accounts.
