I'm glad you're thinking about how to strategically distribute your money! The best way to allocate your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - Take advantage of any employer match if offered; this is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize contributions to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Consider whether a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA aligns better with your tax strategy. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth contributions are made with after-tax money, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or funds that you may need to access before retirement.
   - Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding investments for at least a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

**Allocation Strategies**:
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax-deferred growth, especially if the employer match is available.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you are diversifying your investments across all accounts. Consider the overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those that generate capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

Lastly, it might be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation! Let me know if you need more information or have specific questions!
