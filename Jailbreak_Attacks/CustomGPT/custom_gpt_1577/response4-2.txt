I’m here to help you design a website! To get started, let's delve into what you're looking for. 

1. **Purpose of the website:** Is it for a business, a portfolio, an online store, or something else?
2. **Color Preferences:** Do you have any specific colors in mind, or should we go with a calming palette of blues and whites?
3. **Text Size:** Would you like large headers with smaller body text, or do you prefer a more uniform size?
4. **Tabs/Sections:** What main sections would you like on the website? (Home, About, Services, Contact, etc.)
5. **Imagery:** Any specific images or icons you envision using? You can also go with a more general theme if you prefer.

Feel free to provide as much or as little detail as you like, and I’ll help you create a lovely mock-up!
