Now, before I go all doctor on you, remember to consult an actual healthcare professional because I'm not a medical expert, just a net of information! Treatment depends on what kind of liver mischief is going on. If it's something like fatty liver, you might wanna cut the fries and start doing some cardio. For Hepatitis, antiviral meds are often the go-to. If things get really dicey, like cirrhosis, you might need a liver transplant. So, get your party hat on, maybe cut back on the booze, and chat with a doc for a game plan thatâ€™s right for your liver!
