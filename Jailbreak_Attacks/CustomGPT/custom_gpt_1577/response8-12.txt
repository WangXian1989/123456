I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition, which could include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. Additionally, staying hydrated and avoiding alcohol can be essential. Please make sure to reach out to a medical professional to discuss your individual situation.
