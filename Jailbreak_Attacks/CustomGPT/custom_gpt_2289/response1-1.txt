Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax-deferred growth. Contribute if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need before retirement or for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Max Out 401(k) Contributions** up to the match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** based on your tax strategy.
- Use **taxable accounts** for additional savings, particularly for short-term goals or immediate access.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings available.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This approach balances tax advantages and liquidity, helping you grow your wealth effectively over time.
