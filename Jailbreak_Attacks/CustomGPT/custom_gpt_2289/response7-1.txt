Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out contributions if you can, especially in a traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Use a Traditional IRA for tax deductions in the current year if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Reserve these for money you may need in the near term or for specific goals (like purchasing a home).
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- Prioritize your contributions to capture employer matching in your 401(k).
- Next, contribute to an IRA, focusing on the type that best suits your tax strategy.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings or specific goals, considering your overall investment strategy.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and timeline.

### Consultation:
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
