(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. Generally, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as that's essentially free money.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for tax deductions. The contribution limits for IRAs are typically lower than for 401(k)s.
3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its limit, which can be higher than that of an IRA.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional investing after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for flexibility and liquidity.

Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on your age and retirement goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! When it comes to juggling your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it like a money pie. Hereâ€™s a tasty slice strategy:

1. **401(k) to the Max**: If your job throws in matching contributions, slam as much as you can into that 401(k). Itâ€™s like getting a bonus just for savingâ€”donâ€™t leave that cash on the table!

2. **IRA Love**: Next, dive into your IRA, especially if you can snag some tax deductions. This is where you can really rack up those compound gains without Uncle Sam peeking in too much.

3. **Pour into the 401(k)**: Once youâ€™re on a roll with the IRA, funnel more into that 401(k). Remember, the contribution limits are more forgiving here!

4. **Taxable Accounts = Flexibility**: After filling up your retirement buckets, use taxable accounts for the extra cash. Theyâ€™re great for when you want to dip into your funds without penalties, plus you can do some fun investing freedom!

Just keep an eye on your allocations as you age; you don't want to be all risky when youâ€™re close to retirement!
