To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once tax-advantaged options are maxed out, consider investing in taxable accounts. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

3. **Strategic Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Income Investments**: Consider more conservative or income-producing investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

4. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation across accounts periodically to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan your withdrawals wisely in retirement to minimize taxesâ€”drawing from taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
