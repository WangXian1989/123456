(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, you may want to consider maxing out contributions to employer-sponsored retirement plans, like a 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. After that, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax advantages. Lastly, taxable accounts can be used for investments that you may need access to before retirement or for investments that might benefit from tax-efficient strategies. Diversifying investments in these accounts according to your risk tolerance and long-term goals is also crucial.
