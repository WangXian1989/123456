The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts offer tax benefits.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account typeâ€”this can help you prioritize where to allocate funds.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) can afford to take on more risk since they are long-term investments, while taxable accounts may house more conservative investments.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) can be better placed in taxable accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you maintain an emergency fund before aggressively funding retirement accounts. This should be in a liquid account that you can access easily.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best suits your individual circumstances.
