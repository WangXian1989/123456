To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages:** Allocate additional funds to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) based on your tax situation. For example:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for tax-deferred growth.
   - If you anticipate a lower tax rate, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Diversification of Assets:** Maintain a mix of asset classes in each account type. For example, consider having a combination of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts to provide diversification.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you'll need access to before retirement age, as they offer more flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

5. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these investment accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your future withdrawal strategy according to your tax situation, aiming to minimize tax liabilities during retirement.
