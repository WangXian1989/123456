To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key points:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full match, as it's free money.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize fees and optimize growth.
   - Consider the tax implications of withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as contributions are taxed now but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, but withdrawals will be taxed.
   - Max out contributions annually if possible (as of 2023, it's $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments with high potential for growth that can be held long-term, as gains may be taxed at lower capital gains rates.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### Distribution Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match.
- Max out your IRA.
- Allocate any remaining savings to your taxable accounts.

### Considerations:
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- Review fees associated with each account type.
- Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically.

### Adjustments:
- Adapt your strategy based on your life circumstances (e.g., changes in income or expenses).
