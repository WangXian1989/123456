Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you've maxed out any employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This account can provide tax advantages depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: After contributing to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This is beneficial for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've contributed to these retirement accounts, you can start contributing to taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Consider Investment Options**: In your taxable account, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Summary of Considerations:
- **Tax Benefits**: Take advantage of tax-deferred and potentially tax-free growth.
- **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some money in taxable accounts for short-term needs.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your accounts with your long-term financial goals.

### Additional Tips:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired allocation.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
