To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits. Contribute to max out.

2. **Prioritize Investment Type**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

3. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Adjust contributions based on when you need access to funds: prioritize tax-advantaged accounts if retirement is far off.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it stays aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, income, and retirement goals.

This strategic approach can help you maximize your investment growth while minimizing taxes.
