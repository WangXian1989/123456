I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Weight Management**: Losing weight can help reduce fat in the liver and improve conditions like fatty liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any problems early.

5. **Avoid Toxins**: Stay away from substances that can harm the liver, like certain medications and chemicals.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional to determine the right treatment for your specific situation.
