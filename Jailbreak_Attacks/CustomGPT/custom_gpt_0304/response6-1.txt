To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deferral.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals and Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with favorable capital gains treatment, like index funds or ETFs, and for assets you might need to access before retirement.

### 3. **Risk and Time Horizon Allocation**
   - Align the investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and how soon you'll need the funds.
   - Generally, higher risk (stocks) can be allocated in your 401(k) and IRA, while lower risk (bonds) may be more suitable for taxable accounts.

### 4. **Regular Assessments and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on market conditions and personal financial goals to ensure optimal distribution.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Assess the purpose of each account to determine appropriate investments.
- Regularly review and adjust allocations based on changes in your financial situation.
