To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)), which can reduce your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as 401(k) for traditional IRAs. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short-term goals; you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

3. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively while aligning with your long-term goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you'll want to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts to manage your tax burden.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: If needed, work with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

Balancing your investments across these accounts can optimize your tax advantages while aligning with your financial goals.
