Sure! Here’s a general strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. This is especially useful for short-term goals since it provides flexibility without tax penalties for withdrawals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts in retirement. Strategically withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts first.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

It’s wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
