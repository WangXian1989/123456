(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, a good strategy is to max out your contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy. Lastly, if you have extra funds, allocate those to your taxable accounts. This approach allows for tax diversification and effective long-term growth.
