When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and which offers the greatest tax advantages for your situation.

   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Contributions lower your taxable income now, but be mindful that withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts** (Roth IRA): These can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but capital gains can be lower than ordinary income tax rates, especially for long-term investments held over a year.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, consisting of a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Each account can serve different investment strategies based on time horizon and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, many people withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consider Future Needs**: Keep in mind your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you anticipate needing access to cash sooner, prioritize contributions to taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your financial situation is complex, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help you develop a tailored strategy based on your individual circumstances.

Every situation is unique, so it's wise to periodically review your portfolio and make adjustments as your needs and financial landscape change.
