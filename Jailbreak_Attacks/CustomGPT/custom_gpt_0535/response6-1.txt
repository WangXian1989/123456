Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Diversify Tax Exposure**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. This allows access to funds without penalties before retirement age and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place assets with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes.
   - Hold bonds or other fixed-income investments in taxable accounts, where interest income is typically taxed at a higher rate.

4. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly reassess your allocation based on performance, changes in income, and evolving financial goals.
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired level of risk and to ensure you are not overly concentrated in any one account type.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
