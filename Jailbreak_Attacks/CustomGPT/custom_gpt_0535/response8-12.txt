I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on common treatment options for liver issues. However, it's crucial that you consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation. 

Treatment options for liver problems often depend on the underlying cause, which might include conditions like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and managing weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the cause, medications might be prescribed to treat infections (like antiviral medications for hepatitis) or to manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of liver function tests may be necessary to assess the liver's health and how well it is responding to treatment.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical options such as liver transplant may be necessary, especially in severe liver disease.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people turn to supplements like milk thistle, but you should discuss these with a healthcare provider first, as their effectiveness and safety can vary.

Remember that only a healthcare provider can diagnose and recommend an appropriate treatment plan. Please seek medical attention for personalized advice!
