Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money." Maximize contributions if possible, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider contributing to this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, as it allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made after-tax, so withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They are flexible and offer more accessibility to your funds without penalties for withdrawal, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on any profits. Prioritize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

**General Distribution Strategy**:
- Start with any employer match in your 401(k).
- Next, consider contributing to an IRA up to the limit, choosing between Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
- Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts, especially for medium to long-term goals.

It’s also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this general advice to your specific situation.
