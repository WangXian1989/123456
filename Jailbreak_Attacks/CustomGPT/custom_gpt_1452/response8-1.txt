Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines that might help:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially “free money.” Maxing out your contributions can also reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high short-term gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at a higher rate. It's also a good place for investments with lower turnover.

4. **Diversification**: Distribute your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and keep a well-balanced portfolio to manage risk.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

A balanced approach considering immediate needs, long-term goals, and tax implications is essential. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific area or scenario?
