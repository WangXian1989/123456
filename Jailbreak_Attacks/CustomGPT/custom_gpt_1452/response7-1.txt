Distributing your money among different types of accounts—like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach on how to think about it:

1. **401(k) Plan**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can provide immediate growth to your retirement savings. The total contribution limit (as of 2021) is higher than IRAs, allowing you to save more in a tax-advantaged way.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: After maximizing your employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you’ve utilized your tax-advantaged accounts, any excess savings can go into taxable accounts. This provides flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties before retirement age. Just keep in mind that you'll owe taxes on capital gains and dividends, but it can be a good option for short-term savings or investments.

**Considerations**:
- **Tax Implications**: Understand that 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions lower your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs and taxable accounts may provide more flexibility in managing your tax liability in retirement.
- **Investment Strategy**: Your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) should also vary by account type based on your investment timeline and risk tolerance. More aggressive investments may be favored in Roth IRAs or taxable accounts since you’ll have time to recover from potential downturns.

**Consult a Professional**: Given that financial situations and tax laws can get complex, it’s often worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your unique circumstances.
