When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment options. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), start there. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred. This means you won’t pay taxes on the money you put in until you withdraw it in retirement. This works well if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, this can be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains each year. However, there are advantages, such as withdrawal flexibility without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

4. **Prioritize Savings Goals**: If you have shorter-term goals (like buying a home), you might allocate more to taxable accounts. For longer-term goals (like retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you grow older or your financial situation changes, re-evaluate and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique situation. Would you like more detailed information on any of these aspects?
