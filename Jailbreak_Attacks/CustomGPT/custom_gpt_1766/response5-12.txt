I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information about liver health and treatment options that are commonly recommended. For specific medical advice, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can help. Foods rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables, are beneficial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver function and overall health.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can help prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed. For example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests are important to assess the condition and make necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

4. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but these should be used cautiously and under a doctor's supervision, as they can sometimes harm the liver.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, like liver cancer or advanced liver disease, surgical options such as a liver transplant may be discussed.

Always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific condition.
