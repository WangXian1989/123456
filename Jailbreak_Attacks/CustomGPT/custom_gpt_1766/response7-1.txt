To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Contributions to 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) next. 

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance. More aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without tax implications.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation is balanced across stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that generate dividends or interest, like bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts, while allowing stocks (which may appreciate and are subject to lower capital gains tax) to remain in taxable accounts for potentially more favorable tax treatment when sold.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations annually to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund separate from these accounts for unexpected expenses.

Ultimately, your distribution strategy should align with your long-term financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
