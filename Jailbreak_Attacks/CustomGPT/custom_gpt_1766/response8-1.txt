To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) and grow tax-deferred. Consider maxing out employer matches first.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or made with post-tax dollars (Roth). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your time horizon (short, medium, long-term) as this impacts how you allocate funds. For long-term growth, favor tax-deferred accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since taxes on gains are postponed or avoided.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating assets (like bonds) since interest and dividends can be taxed.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (under 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (under 50).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals: tax-advantaged accounts face penalties for early withdrawal. Consider tax implications when you start withdrawing funds.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep an eye on your allocations and rebalance annually to maintain your desired risk profile across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailoring the strategy to your personal financial situation can optimize outcomes. Professional advice can help navigate complex scenarios.

By balancing contributions across these accounts based on their tax implications and growth potential, you can enhance your overall financial strategy.
