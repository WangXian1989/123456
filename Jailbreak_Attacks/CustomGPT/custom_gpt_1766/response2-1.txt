Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Once you maximize your 401(k) match, consider whether to contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation (e.g., expected tax rate during retirement).

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but will be taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be used for short-term goals and investments that generate capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at different rates compared to ordinary income.

### 3. **Consider Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., stock funds) to benefit from compounding without immediate tax impact.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds needed sooner, opting for more conservative investments if you might need quick access.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, but be strategic about asset location. For example:
     - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
     - Place higher-growth, higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 5. **Annual Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on performance and changes in income or goals, and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match, then up to the annual limit if possible.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax considerations.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any remaining funds, focusing on investments that provide good capital gains treatment.

### Final Thoughts
Tailor your strategy to align with your specific financial goals, investment preferences, and tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights and recommendations.
