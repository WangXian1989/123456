Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations to guide your decision:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Often comes with employer match, tax-deferred growth, and required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 73.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-deferred, with more investment options; contributions may be tax-deductible depending on income and filing status.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. Optimize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match, as this is free money.
- **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and anticipated future tax rate.

### 3. Tax Considerations
- **Tax-Deferred vs. Taxable Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments and growth. 
- **Withdrawals**: Plan for when and how you'll need to access your funds. Taxable accounts can be more flexible for short-term needs.

### 4. Diversify Investments
- Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk and leverage the different tax treatments.

### 5. Regular Review and Adjustment
- Reassess your allocations periodically in light of changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match.
- **IRA**: Aim to max out contributions if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for any additional savings or investments, particularly if you anticipate needing access to funds within a few years.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy can vary based on individual circumstances, such as age, income, and financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
