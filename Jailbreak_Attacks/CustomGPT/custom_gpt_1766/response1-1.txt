Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts where your investments can grow without current taxation.
   - Allocate a mix of stocks (for growth) and bonds (for stability), based on your risk tolerance.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, steer excess funds into taxable accounts. These offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement strategy.
   - As you approach retirement, you may want to shift toward more conservative investments.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the complexities and potential tax implications, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy to your specific situation.

This framework provides a balanced approach tailored to both growth and risk management.
