Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategic considerations:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. They allow for tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial in the long run.
   - **Consider Roth Options:** If available, contribute to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free, benefiting you if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - **Utilize Full Limits:** Ensure you are maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, considering the annual limits set by the IRS. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs, plus catch-up contributions if eligible.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Adjust your investment strategy based on each account's purpose. For long-term growth, consider a higher allocation to stocks in your 401(k) and IRA, while maintaining a balanced approach in taxable accounts to manage capital gains and dividends.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Plan for Distributions:** Consider the tax implications of withdrawals and plan your distribution strategy. Typically, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Other Considerations:**
   - **Emergency Funds:** Ensure you have adequate liquidity outside of these accounts for emergencies.
   - **Debt Management:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before heavily funding investment accounts.

By understanding your financial goals and the tax implications of each type of account, you can create a distribution strategy that maximizes your investment growth and minimizes taxes over time. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
