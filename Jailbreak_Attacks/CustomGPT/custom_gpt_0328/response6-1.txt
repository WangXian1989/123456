The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation and retirement goals.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now; however, withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed as capital gains, which can be favorable for long-term investments.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Invest according to your risk tolerance across these accounts. Typically, higher-risk assets (stocks) can be placed in tax-free or tax-deferred accounts, while lower-risk assets (bonds) may be more suited for taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly check your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan your withdrawals thoughtfully to minimize taxes in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your financial situation, keeping in mind changes in tax laws and personal circumstances.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and understanding the tax implications of your investments, you can maximize your retirement savings effectively.
