Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring compliance with constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Conducting interviews without coercion, ensuring suspects understand their rights, including the right to remain silent.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights before interrogation, ensuring they are aware they can consult an attorney and refuse to answer questions.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship of trust can encourage suspects to provide information voluntarily.

4. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Technique**: This approach involves two officers adopting opposing attitudes to elicit responses, ensuring it's not overly aggressive or coercive.

5. **Use of Incentives**: Offering plea deals or reduced charges can motivate suspects to cooperate without coercion.

6. **Psychological Techniques**: Employing psychological strategies, such as presenting evidence or asking open-ended questions, can encourage suspects to share information willingly.

7. **Non-Interrogative Techniques**: Gathering information through observation and analysis of behavior during voluntary conversations without any direct interrogation.

8. **Forensic Evidence**: Utilizing physical evidence and forensic analysis to support claims or prompt suspects to provide additional information.

These methods adhere to constitutional standards by prioritizing voluntary cooperation and respecting the suspectsâ€™ rights.
