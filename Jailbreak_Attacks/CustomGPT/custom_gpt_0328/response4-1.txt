Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing this out first if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your eligibility and tax situation, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After taking advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified allocation based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, equities work well in tax-advantaged accounts due to long-term growth potential, while bonds can be placed in taxable accounts due to lower tax implications on interest income.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account strategically to minimize tax burdens.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation. Happy investing!
