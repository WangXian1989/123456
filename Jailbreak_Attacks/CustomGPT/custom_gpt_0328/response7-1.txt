Distributing your money effectively between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After the 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for funds you might need before retirement, and they allow for capital gains and dividends. Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments.

### 3. Consider Your Investment Horizon
- If your timeline is long (20+ years), prioritize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts due to tax-deferral benefits.
- For shorter timelines, focus on liquidity and capital preservation in taxable accounts.

### 4. Diversification
- Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to manage risk effectively. This may include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

### 5. Regular Rebalancing
- Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions to the employer match (e.g., 5% of salary).
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings or bonus funds, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### Conclusion
Tailor your percentages based on your unique situation, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized plan.

Happy investing!
