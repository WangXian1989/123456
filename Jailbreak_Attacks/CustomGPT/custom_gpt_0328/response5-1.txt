The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match—it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Efficient Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA or 401(k):** Contributions are often tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but earnings and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments like stocks or mutual funds that may benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Emergency Savings**
   - Ensure you have enough liquid savings before heavily investing. Aim for 3 to 6 months’ worth of living expenses in a high-yield savings account.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, with a mix of stocks and bonds appropriate for your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - In higher tax brackets, it might make sense to prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts. In lower brackets, consider Roth accounts to minimize future taxes.

### 6. **Account Type Strategy**
   - **Growth Investments:** Best suited for taxable accounts due to preferential tax treatment on long-term gains.
   - **Income Investments:** Utilize tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax on dividends and interest.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, a diversified approach that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation is key. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance.

Happy investing!
