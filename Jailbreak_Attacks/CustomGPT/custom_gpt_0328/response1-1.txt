Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional) for tax benefits.
   - If you have higher income, a Roth IRA may provide tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable events, like short-term trades or bonds, to avoid immediate tax burdens in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize long-term growth.
   - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Make consistent contributions across all accounts to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your specific situation for optimal strategy.

By carefully allocating your funds, you can enhance growth and minimize taxes over time. Happy investing!
