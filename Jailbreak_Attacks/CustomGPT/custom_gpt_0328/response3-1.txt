Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if it’s a Roth IRA where withdrawals can be tax-free in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - **Growth-oriented investments**: Better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) due to fewer tax implications on gains.
   - **Income-producing investments**: Consider placing these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Managing capital gains in taxable accounts can help minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside investments.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your situation.
