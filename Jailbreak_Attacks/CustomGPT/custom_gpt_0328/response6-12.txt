I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Low-fat, high-fiber diets with plenty of fruits and vegetables can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help reduce liver inflammation.
   - **Glucose Control**: In cases related to diabetes and fatty liver disease.

3. **Procedures**
   - **Endoscopy**: To manage complications like varices in cirrhosis.
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver failure.

4. **Regular Monitoring**
   - **Check-ups**: Frequent liver function tests and ultrasounds to monitor progress.

Consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific condition.
