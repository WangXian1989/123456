To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize the employer match, then consider contributing more if your tax situation benefits from the tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for a tax deduction now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need access to before retirement age or for investments that might yield more favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains. 

4. **Debt Consideration**: Pay off high-interest debt before making significant investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly revisit and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide tailored advice based on your individual financial situation and goals.

By following these tips, you can create a solid investment strategy that balances growth potential with tax efficiency.
