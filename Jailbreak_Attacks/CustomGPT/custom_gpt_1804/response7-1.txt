Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors, including your current income, retirement goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals
- **Short-term needs:** Identify any upcoming expenses or purchases in the next few years.
- **Long-term goals:** Define your retirement age and lifestyle, along with any other long-term financial objectives.

### 2. Understand the Tax Implications
- **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but will be taxed at withdrawal. Ideal for high-income years.
- **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider future tax brackets.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed annually. Use these for more liquid investments or if you expect to need the funds sooner.

### 3. Prioritize Contributions
- **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match—this is essentially free money.
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth, if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### 4. Asset Allocation
- **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance, generally more aggressive in 401(k) and IRA, and more conservative in taxable accounts for easier access.
- **Diversity Across Accounts:** Avoid a single type of investment across all accounts. This means, for example, holding some stocks in your 401(k) and bonds in your IRA or taxable accounts to balance risk.

### 5. Reassess Regularly
- **Annual Review:** Regularly assess your asset allocation and investment performance, adjusting contributions as income, expenses, and market conditions change.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out contributions to get full employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum (or as much as you can based on your tax situation).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining savings for additional investments, focusing on liquid assets.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution will depend on your specific financial situation and goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique profile.
