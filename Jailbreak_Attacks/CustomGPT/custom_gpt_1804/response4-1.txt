Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. 
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Diversify Based on Goals**:
   - For long-term growth, focus on higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a Roth IRA) to minimize the tax burden on growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected growth or that you might need access to sooner.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, as they generate fewer taxable events.
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (such as bonds or actively managed funds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess your portfolio's performance and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications. Generally, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can tailor a distribution strategy to your unique financial situation.

Make sure to revisit your strategy as your goals and tax laws change.
