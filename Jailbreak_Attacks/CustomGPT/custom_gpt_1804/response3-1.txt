Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax savings or tax-free growth, depending on the type.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, usually in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but earnings grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income and capital gains are taxed. This account is more flexible but less tax-efficient.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement needs.
   - **Short-Term Goals (within 5 years):** Consider keeping money in a taxable account for easier access.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Asset Location:** Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - **Rebalance Portfolio:** Regularly check and adjust your asset allocation as needed.
   - **Reevaluate Goals:** As your financial situation and goals change, adjust your contribution strategy.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Any remaining savings can be directed to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

By balancing your investments across these accounts and keeping an eye on tax implications, you can optimize your savings for both growth and accessibility. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
