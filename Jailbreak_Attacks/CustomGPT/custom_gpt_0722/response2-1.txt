Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowable limit. If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) contributions, fund a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After fully funding your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is useful for goals outside retirement since you have more access to your funds without penalties.

4. **Balance Your Investments**: Diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts. Generally, consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and less volatile investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of tax implications:
   - Capital gains tax on taxable accounts.
   - Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, which could affect your tax situation in retirement.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor strategies to your specific situation.
