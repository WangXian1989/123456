When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of employer matching, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth can be beneficial.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or income (such as bonds), as these are taxed at your ordinary income rate. 
   - Place investments in tax-advantaged accounts that would otherwise be taxed heavily, such as higher yielding assets or those expected to appreciate substantially.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. This can include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to ensure alignment with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. This can help maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - In retirement, think about how you will withdraw funds from these accounts. Withdrawals from taxable accounts may be more tax-efficient if timed correctly, and utilize tax brackets strategically.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
