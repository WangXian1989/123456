The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Good for higher-income earners who want upfront tax savings.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but with contribution limits. Taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals, including growth, are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offers flexibility, but investment income is taxed in the year it’s received. Useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.

3. **Age Considerations**: 
   - If you’re younger, focus on Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.
   - As you approach retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts to lower taxable income in your working years.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without taxation for longer.

5. **Adjust for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: If you have a 401(k) or traditional IRA, remember that RMDs begin at age 73, affecting how you withdraw funds and your tax situation.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Revisit your allocation annually or after major life events.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized strategy can be beneficial. A financial advisor can help you optimize your specific situation.

By thoughtfully considering these elements, you can better allocate your investments to fit your long-term financial goals.
