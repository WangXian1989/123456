To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out contributions each year.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if your income allows; otherwise, use a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

2. **Evaluate your investment goals and time horizon**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess whether you are comfortable with market fluctuations to decide on an aggressive or conservative asset allocation.
   - **Time Frame**: Allocate funds in a way that aligns with your expected retirement age. Younger investors might prioritize growth in riskier assets, while those closer to retirement may prefer stability.

3. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.
   - **Account Types**: Utilize each account's strengths; for instance, use a taxable account for investments that produce high dividends or interest, which could lead to higher tax liabilities.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and personal financial goals.
