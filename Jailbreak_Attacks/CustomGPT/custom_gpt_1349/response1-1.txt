To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you choose a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement but require after-tax contributions. 

3. **Investment Growth**: Prioritize accounts that offer the best growth potential. Generally, tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) should be used for investments that are expected to grow significantly, as the tax benefits are more pronounced on higher growth.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to spread risk.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind that taxable accounts provide more liquidity compared to retirement accounts. If you anticipate needing access to cash before retirement, consider allocating more to taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Consider the tax implications of drawing from each account type.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocation to align with your changing financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
