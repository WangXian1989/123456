The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
   - Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Beyond Basic Contributions**: 
   - After maximizing your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   
4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals and may be beneficial for shorter-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account type, consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets in a way that balances growth potential with risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments according to life changes or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor** (if needed): A financial professional can tailor strategies to your specific circumstances and help optimize tax efficiency across your accounts.

Remember, tax laws can change, and it’s essential to stay informed or consult with a tax professional.
