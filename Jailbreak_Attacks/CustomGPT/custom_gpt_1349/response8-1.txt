Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - Once you've done that, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains each year, so consider placing investments that generate little income here, like growth stocks.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts with higher tax benefits (like Roth IRA) to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments that yield income, as these investments may have lower tax implications when held long-term.

4. **Balance**:
   - Ensure diversification across all accounts to balance risk and return.
   - Adjust your allocations based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

5. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Personal finance can be complex, and getting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs and situation.

Remember, individual circumstances vary, so adjust these strategies according to your financial goals and needs.
