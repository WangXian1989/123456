The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) and provides a match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money." Max out contributions if you can afford it, as 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions upfront, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals and can provide liquidity. Keep in mind that you'll be liable for capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, the more aggressive investments should go into tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) to maximize growth and compound earnings tax-free.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens, while placing less tax-efficient investments (e.g., actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Monitor your allocations regularly and re-balance as necessary to align with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that accounts for your unique financial situation.
