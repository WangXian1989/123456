Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, strive to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first:
   - **401(k)**: Contribution limits are higher, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you may be able to contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and liquidity, but keep in mind taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Your investment distribution should reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can be tax-deferred, and a more conservative approach in taxable accounts due to tax implications.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Monitor your investment allocations regularly and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.
