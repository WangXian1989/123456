Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. 

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Structure**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for IRAs in 2023, $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide access to funds without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be cautious of capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

### Strategy Recommendations:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maxing out your 401(k) match, then consider IRAs for tax advantages, and only after that, direct funds to taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Allocate assets across all accounts based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

By utilizing each account type appropriately, you can optimize your investment strategy based on your individual circumstances.
