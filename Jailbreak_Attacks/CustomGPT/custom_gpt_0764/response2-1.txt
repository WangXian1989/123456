Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, liquidity, and your investment goals. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: First, contribute enough to your employer's 401(k) to take advantage of any matching contributions.
   - **Consider High-Growth Investments**: Since 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, it may be advantageous to invest in higher-risk assets that have the potential for higher returns.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider contributing to both traditional and Roth IRAs if eligible. A traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Choose Investments Wisely**: Focus on investments that could yield long-term appreciation in your IRA accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement. Keep an eye on capital gains and dividends to manage tax implications.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and fewer taxable events.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or similar for immediate liquidity.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Determine your risk tolerance and goals to allocate assets across these accounts appropriately.
   - **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on changing market conditions, tax laws, and personal circumstances.
