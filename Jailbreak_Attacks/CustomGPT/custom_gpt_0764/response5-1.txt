To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Aim to max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, then contribute to your IRA. 

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, focus on pre-tax contributions to minimize current taxes. If you're in a lower bracket, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Divide your investments based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. Typically, you may want to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (for tax efficiency) and stocks in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy to align with changing financial situations, market conditions, and tax laws.
