Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRAs**: 
   - If you can, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction.

### 3. **Back to 401(k)**: 
   - After maximizing any available match and IRA contributions, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Flexibility**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might require liquidity or if you anticipate needing the money before retirement. They can also be advantageous for some investments that may be taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Investment Selection**:
   - Choose tax-efficient investments for your taxable accounts (like ETFs or tax-managed funds) and consider more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**: 
   - Review and adjust your strategy annually based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Conclusion:
- A balanced approach typically involves maximizing employee benefits first, then prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts, and finally looking at taxable accounts for overflow or flexible needs.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
