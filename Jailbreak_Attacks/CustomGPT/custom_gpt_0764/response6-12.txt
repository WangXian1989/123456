To provide you with the best advice, it would be helpful to know more specifics about your liver problem, such as the diagnosis (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis) and any symptoms you may be experiencing. Generally, treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and reduce fat accumulation.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Other Medications**: Depending on the condition, there may be specific drugs to manage symptoms or underlying issues.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary, particularly in cases of cirrhosis.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Keep up with regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

Please consult with a healthcare professional for personalized treatment options based on your specific condition.
