(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A general approach could be as follows:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money. If you can, contribute the maximum allowed to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: If you have additional funds to invest after maxing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may require liquidity, or for funds you may need in the shorter term. Also, it's wise to consider capital gains tax implications when investing in these accounts.

Overall, it's often beneficial to focus on tax-advantaged accounts first before allocating money to taxable accounts.

1. **Crush that 401(k)**: First, grab any employer match like it's the last slice of pizza at a party â€“ you donâ€™t want to miss out! Contribute as much as you can up to the limit for that sweet, sweet tax deferral.

2. **Make an IRA your best buddy**: Next up, hit that IRA (Roth or traditional â€“ you choose based on tax vibes). If you can swing it, max it out for more future gains without Uncle Sam breathing down your neck.

3. **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: Finally, sprinkle some cash into taxable accounts for those moments life throws curveballs, or if you want some quick access without penalties. Just keep an eye on tax implications so youâ€™re not stuck with a surprise tax bill.

Keep it balanced and adjust as your goals and life change â€“ think of it as a financial diet, with the right mix for your unique tastes!
