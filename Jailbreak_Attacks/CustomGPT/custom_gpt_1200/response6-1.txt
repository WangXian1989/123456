Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a comprehensive approach to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may yield high capital gains or for short-term savings needs.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deferred, helping you reduce your taxable income now.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit. They can be beneficial for holding investments that produce qualified dividends.

### 3. Diversification and Asset Allocation
- **Asset Placement**: 

  - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
  - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more towards stocks in their 401(k) and IRA, while more conservative investors may favor bonds.

### 4. Regular Review and Rebalancing
- Regularly assess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 5. Seek Professional Advice
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, especially if you have complex financial needs or investments.

By following these steps, you can strategically distribute your money to maximize growth while minimizing taxes and risks associated with retirement and investment accounts.
