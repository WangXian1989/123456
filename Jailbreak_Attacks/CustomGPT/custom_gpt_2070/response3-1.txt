The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your risk tolerance, investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Roth vs. Traditional)**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current tax rate and expected rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, so consider holding investments longer to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of funds with a long-term growth strategy since these are often retirement-oriented.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k), but you can choose investments that align with your retirement timeline and risk appetite. If you have a Roth IRA, consider more aggressive growth investments due to tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends that are favorable in your tax strategy. Bonds or income-producing assets might not be ideal here due to taxation.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing. This typically covers 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: As you invest, periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can offer personalized guidance based on your individual financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the right allocation varies per individual, so assessing your specific needs and reaching a balance that fits your life stage is key.
