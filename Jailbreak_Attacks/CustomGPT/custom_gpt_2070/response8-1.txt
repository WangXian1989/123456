The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, your tax situation, and your investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. If you have a traditional 401(k), consider maxing out contributions (up to the IRS limit) if you can.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Both have tax advantages. A traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax situation.
   - **Health Savings Account (HSA)**: If eligible, this account offers triple tax advantagesâ€”tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. Benefits include:
   - Flexibility of access at any time without penalties.
   - Capital gains tax treatment, which can be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and reward based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations regularly, especially as your financial situation changes or as you get closer to your retirement goals.
