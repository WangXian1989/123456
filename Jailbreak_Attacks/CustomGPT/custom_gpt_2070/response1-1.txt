Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (subject to rules). 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are often tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth accounts are funded with post-tax money, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments within these accounts are diversified. This might mean different asset allocations in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve filled your 401(k) and IRA contributions, taxable accounts can be beneficial for investment flexibility. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or a similar low-risk vehicle.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice from a financial professional to tailor a strategy that best fits your personal situation.

Remember, your needs may change over time, so regularly reassess your strategy.
