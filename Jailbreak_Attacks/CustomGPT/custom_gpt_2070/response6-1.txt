To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and your individual financial situation. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum limit if your finances allow.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Balance Contributions with Financial Goals
- **Investment Horizon:** If you plan to access funds in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts. For long-term growth, lean more towards 401(k) and IRA contributions.
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify within each account based on your risk tolerance. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Consider Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax relief. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA could be beneficial.
- **Withdrawals:** Remember that withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as regular income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are typically tax-free.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- Maximize 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- Fund your IRA to the maximum limit.
- Invest any additional funds in a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments to minimize liabilities.

By categorizing and prioritizing your accounts based on these factors, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
