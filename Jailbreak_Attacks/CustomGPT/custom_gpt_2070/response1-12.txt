I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver treatment options. However, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Typically, treatment will depend on the underlying cause of your liver problem, which could include conditions like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Some common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, doctors may prescribe antiviral medications for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms related to liver disease.
3. **Management of Complications:** This may include procedures to manage symptoms like fluid buildup or varices (enlarged veins).
4. **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary if the liver is failing.

Always follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for the best course of action tailored to your specific situation.
