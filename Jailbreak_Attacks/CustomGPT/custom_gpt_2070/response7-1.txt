When determining the best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors like your current income, tax situation, investment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Plan**: If your employer offers a 401(k), take advantage of it, especially if they match contributions. Contributing enough to receive the full match is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, but at a minimum, contribute enough to get the match. This account offers tax-deferral benefits.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you’re eligible, a Roth IRA is advantageous since contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met. Conversely, a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions, reducing your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can focus on taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment options, but you'll be responsible for taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are well-diversified. This may mean having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment distributions and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, life circumstances, or tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation and goals.
