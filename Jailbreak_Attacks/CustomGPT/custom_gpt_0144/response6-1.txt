Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to maximize tax efficiency and growth. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k] Contribution**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. 

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may have lower capital gains taxes or generate qualified dividends. This can include index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Balancing Investments**
   - **Risk and Time Horizon**: Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where the growth isn’t taxed until withdrawal. Keep more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (up to company match)
- **Traditional IRA**: Max out contributions after 401(k)
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining savings in low-turnover index funds or ETFs.

This strategy helps minimize taxes in the long run while benefiting from compound growth. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized plans.
