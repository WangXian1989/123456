To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term needs**: Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out annual contributions for tax benefits (consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth).

### 3. **Investment Choices**
   - **401(k)**: Look for low-fee index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: More flexibility in investment choices, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., ETFs, tax-efficient funds).

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth). Withdrawals in retirement are taxed based on your income at that time.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay capital gains tax on profits. Focus on long-term investments to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market changes and your financial goals.

### 6. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to reduce risk.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 50% of retirement savings
- **IRA**: 30% of retirement savings
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% for flexibility and short-term goals

### Final Tips
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your unique situation.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep track of changes in tax laws that might affect your distribution strategy.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively manage your investments across different accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
