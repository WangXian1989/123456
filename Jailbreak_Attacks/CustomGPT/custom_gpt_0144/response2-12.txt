I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables can benefit liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver function and overall health.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications like tenofovir or entecavir may be prescribed.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases, medications that suppress the immune system can be effective.

3. **Supplements**:
   - **Vitamin E**: Sometimes recommended for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
   - **Milk Thistle**: An herbal remedy often used for liver ailments, though evidence of its effectiveness is mixed.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Eliminating alcohol consumption can help prevent further liver damage.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
