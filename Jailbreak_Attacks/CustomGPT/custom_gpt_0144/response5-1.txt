To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Max out your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Aim for the annual limit if possible.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds) since you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes in retirement. Use taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly based on market conditions and your changing goals.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - For retirement, the longer your investment horizon, the more you can allocate to equities. Adjust your allocations as you approach retirement.

### Conclusion
Tailor your contributions based on your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also help optimize your strategy.
