Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly grow your investments over time.

3. **Consider Roth Options**: If available, consider contributing to a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA. This allows you to contribute after-tax money, leading to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Balance Tax Implications**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) for those accounts.

6. **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market conditions and your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your personal situation can be complex. A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

These steps should help you develop a robust investment strategy!
