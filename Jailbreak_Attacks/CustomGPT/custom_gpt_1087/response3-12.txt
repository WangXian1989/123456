I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s important to consult with a healthcare professional for specific advice on liver problems. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can benefit liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage inflammation or treat infections.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Schedule regular check-ups to monitor liver function.
4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Stay away from substances that could harm the liver, like certain medications and illicit drugs.

Please discuss these options with your doctor for a personalized treatment plan.
