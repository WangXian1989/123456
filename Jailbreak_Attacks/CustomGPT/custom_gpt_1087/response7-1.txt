Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax efficiency and retirement planning. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions, especially if you can deduct them from your taxable income.

2. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, along with bonds, since interest from bonds can be taxed at higher rates.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these accounts for higher-yield investments, such as actively managed funds or REITs, which can be less tax-efficient outside of tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing risk tolerance.

4. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This balance maximizes growth potential while managing tax impacts effectively.
