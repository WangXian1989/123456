The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out to get any employer match.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest and dividends are taxed in the year theyâ€™re earned, and capital gains are taxed when you sell assets.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for their tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergency funds, as they provide more liquidity.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the annual limits for 401(k) and IRA contributions. Maximize these limits if possible for optimal growth.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k)** contributions to benefit from employer matching.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably a Roth if eligible) to take advantage of tax-free growth.
- **Invest in taxable accounts** for additional savings and flexibility, particularly if you have already maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%

This is a general guideline; adjust based on your specific situation, including age, risk tolerance, and retirement plans. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.
