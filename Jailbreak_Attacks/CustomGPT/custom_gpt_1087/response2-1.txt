Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Max out IRA contributions**: After your 401(k), consider putting money into a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future income expectations. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Fund 401(k) to maximum**: If you can, increase your 401(k) contributions to the maximum limit, benefiting from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows for more liquid assets and flexibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider tax implications**: For higher-income years, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)) and switch to taxable accounts during lower-income years when you can take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

6. **Diversify investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investment choices (stocks, bonds, ETFs) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Review regularly**: Reassess your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
