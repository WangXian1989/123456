To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding assets with lower turnover.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on equities in your retirement accounts for long-term growth, where tax advantages can be maximized.
   - **Bonds/Interest Income:** Keep higher-yield bonds (often taxed as ordinary income) in retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficiency:** In taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk.

5. **Regular Review:** Periodically review your allocations to adjust for market changes and life events.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

Following these steps can help you create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
