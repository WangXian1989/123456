Certainly! Here are some strategies to effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts since they offer tax advantages. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Depending on your current and expected future tax brackets, you might want to focus more on traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) for tax-deferred growth if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you're already maxing out contributions in your 401(k) and IRA, consider how much to invest in taxable accounts. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, stocks are favored for long-term growth while bonds can provide more stability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investment distribution as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation across all account types.

6. **Investment Selection**: Choose investments that provide good growth potential within your 401(k) and IRA. In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider which accounts to withdraw from first based on tax implications. Generally, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts before tax-advantaged accounts, especially if you want to let your IRA or 401(k) grow.
