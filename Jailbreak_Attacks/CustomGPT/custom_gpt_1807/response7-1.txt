To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now, depending on income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your retirement accounts, you can contribute to a taxable account. Diversify your investments here, as you'll have more flexibility with withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your financial goals, considering each account's tax implications and liquidity needs.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax efficiency of your investments. For instance, hold bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens on taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
