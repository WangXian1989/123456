I'm glad you're exploring your options for distributing your money across different investment accounts. However, it's important to note that I can't provide specific financial advice. Instead, I can share some general strategies that individuals often consider when deciding how to allocate their investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Understand the Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing taxable income in the year they are made. Growth within the account is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), but there are annual contribution limits and potential tax deductions based on income and other factors.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are made with after-tax money, and you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments. However, you can also use tax-loss harvesting strategies.

2. **Establish Emergency Savings:**
   - Before allocating funds to long-term investments, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses.

3. **Consider Your Financial Goals:**
   - Different accounts may serve different purposes: retirement savings, short-term goals, or liquidity needs. Define your goals clearly to guide your decisions.

4. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before focusing on other accounts.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Within each account type, consider diversifying your investments to spread risk. Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Think about how and when you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts may require different strategies based on tax implications.

It's always beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your individual circumstances. Feel free to ask more questions or seek clarification on any of these points!
