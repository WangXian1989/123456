When distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are a few general considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, potentially lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. Contributions can be beneficial for those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, and qualified withdrawals, including growth, are tax-free. This can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow you to withdraw funds without penalties or required minimum distributions, offering greater flexibility in accessing your money.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of the tax implications when selling investments, as capital gains tax can apply.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) to secure any employer match, then consider contributing to a Roth IRA, followed by a Traditional IRA if you're eligible.
- **Tax Diversification**: A mix of accounts allows you to better manage taxes in retirement. Using both tax-deferred and tax-free accounts can provide flexibility in withdrawals.
- **Reassess Regularly**: Your needs may change over time, so it’s wise to review and adjust your contributions and balances regularly.

As always, consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor to ensure your strategy aligns with your overall financial goals. Feel free to ask more questions!
