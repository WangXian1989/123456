When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the strengths and benefits of each type of account:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, and your investments grow tax-deferred.
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Tax Deductions or Tax-Free Growth:** Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, you can either deduct contributions (traditional) or withdraw funds tax-free in retirement (Roth).
   - **Investment Options:** Typically offers a wider range of investment options compared to a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts are not tied to retirement, so you can withdraw money at any time without penalties (though you will pay taxes on any gains).
   - **Capital Gains Management:** You can strategically sell investments to manage capital gains taxes.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match before allocating funds elsewhere.
- **Prioritize an IRA:** After maxing out any employer match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially if you've maximized your retirement account contributions.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Tax Bracket:** Consider your current and projected future tax brackets when deciding between pre-tax and post-tax contributions.
- **Time Horizon:** Determine how soon you may need access to your funds, as this impacts the suitability of each account type.
