When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize tax efficiency and align with your financial goals:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - If your income is high, prioritize the 401(k) for pre-tax contributions to lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - Avoid over-contributing to IRAs if you’re also contributing significantly to a 401(k), keeping annual limits in mind.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider keeping bonds or other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

4. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balance across tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility in retirement to manage withdrawals tax-efficiently.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, consider drawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, especially if your income from other sources is low.

Always consider your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals when determining the best distribution strategy. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice. Feel free to ask more if you need clarification or additional information!
