When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about a few key factors. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. You'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, your contributions may be tax-deductible now (traditional) or withdrawals may be tax-free in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income in taxable accounts is subject to capital gains taxes, so consider using these for investments you might hold for a shorter term.

3. **Investment Goals:** Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals. Consider your risk tolerance, retirement age, and income needs in retirement.

4. **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, as different accounts may have different tax implications. 

6. **Limitations and Regulations:** Be aware of contribution limits to each type of account and any penalties for early withdrawals.

A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate any additional funds to your taxable account.
