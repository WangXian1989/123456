It's great that you're thinking about the allocation of your investments across different accounts! The best strategy often depends on individual factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here are some general considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Investment growth is also tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at your regular income tax rate, while long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Investment Horizon**:
   - If you are saving for retirement, it may be beneficial to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs, especially considering employer matching contributions in 401(k)s.
   - For investments with shorter time horizons or for flexibility, a taxable account may be suitable.

3. **Diversification and Asset Location**:
   - Certain investments may perform better in different types of accounts. For example, high-growth investments might be better in a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, while bond funds (which generate interest) may be better suited for tax-deferred accounts to avoid immediate taxation.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type, ensuring you maximize potential employer matches in a 401(k) before contributing to other accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Rules**: Knowing the rules for withdrawals on each account type is crucial. Penalties for early withdrawals can apply to 401(k) and traditional IRAs, while Roth IRAs provide more flexibility for contributions.
