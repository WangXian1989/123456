1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For hepatitis infections.
   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Blood Tests**: To track liver function and health.
   - **Imaging Tests**: Like ultrasounds or CT scans to monitor liver condition.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
