To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer matching. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize putting money into your IRA (Roth or Traditional) for potential tax benefits. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. Consider holding tax-efficient investments here, like index funds and ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investment types based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks are generally better for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your accounts periodically to ensure your asset allocation matches your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan based on your specific situation.

Always consider your overall financial goals and any tax implications when making these decisions.
