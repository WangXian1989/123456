Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both are tax-advantaged. Traditional accounts allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can be subject to capital gains tax, so consider keeping investments that yield higher returns in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. This helps manage risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Aim for a Balanced Approach**:
   - Consider a balanced distribution to meet your short-term and long-term needs. For example, focus on tax-deferred accounts for growth while maintaining some liquidity in your taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy.
