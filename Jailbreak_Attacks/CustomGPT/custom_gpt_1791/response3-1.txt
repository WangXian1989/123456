The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income now, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term goals or if you want more flexibility. Keep in mind that you'll have to pay capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Diversification**: Aim to create a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice considering your specific situation.

By following these principles, you'll create a balanced approach to your retirement savings.
