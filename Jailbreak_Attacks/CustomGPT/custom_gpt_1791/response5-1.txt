To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Allocate 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the employer match, consider continuing contributions to your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high dividends or capital gains, as these can be taxed more favorably. This is particularly useful for short-term goals, like buying a house.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Balance your contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets. Higher contributions to tax-advantaged accounts make sense if you're in a higher bracket now.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure you have a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Review your strategy regularly to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
