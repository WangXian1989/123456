The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, it’s beneficial to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA (whether Traditional or Roth) before allocating funds to taxable accounts. This helps you potentially reduce your taxable income.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Typically, 3-6 months’ worth of expenses is a good target.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, for example, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

5. **Investment Strategy**: Align your investment strategy with your retirement time frame. Generally, younger individuals can afford to take more risks with equities in their 401(k) and IRA, while you might want to prioritize more stable investments in taxable accounts as you approach retirement.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Understand how different accounts affect your tax situation. Withdrawals from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

7. **Diversification**: Maintain diversification across all accounts. This means having a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, cash) that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to ensure you remain aligned with your financial goals.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide insights based on your overall financial picture.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will differ from person to person based on individual circumstances. Adjust your contributions based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the amount you can afford to invest while still meeting other financial obligations.
