Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Focus on maxing out your contributions if possible, as contributions are made pre-tax and grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA after contributing to your 401(k), depending on your income and tax bracket. 
   - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers a tax deduction at the time of contribution.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may have higher turnover, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.
   - This is also a good place for investments that you might need access to before retirement without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
   - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like equities) and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Keep an eye on your investment distribution and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best approach is tailored to your unique financial landscape, so take the time to assess your situation or seek professional advice.
