(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before fully funding your IRA. This is essentially free money.
  
2. **Optimize Tax Advantages**: Contribute to your traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing the employer match. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once retirement accounts are funded, consider using taxable accounts for additional investing. These accounts don’t have contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, making them flexible.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: In taxable accounts, index funds or ETFs that have low turnover can be tax-efficient. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on assets sold for a profit.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're investing in a diversified portfolio across all accounts, including stocks, bonds, and other assets, based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
