The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the employer match, if available, and contribute up to the maximum allowed (for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or after-tax (Roth 401(k)), providing immediate tax benefits or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Typically limited to a selection of funds chosen by your employer. Ensure your investments are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: You can choose between a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions (taxed upon withdrawal), whereas Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The maximum contribution for 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs offer a wider range of investment options compared to most 401(k)s, allowing for more diversified strategies.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts do not have contribution limits and provide access to your money whenever you need it, making them useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Investments in taxable accounts can lead to yearly capital gains taxes, so consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize the tax impact.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
- **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA. 
- **Rest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement contributions, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility.

### Overall Allocation:
- The exact percentages will depend on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals, but a commonly suggested approach is to aim for 60-80% in retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) and 20-40% in taxable accounts, adjusting as you approach retirement.

### Final Note:
Itâ€™s essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure a well-constructed plan that aligns with your personal goals and risk tolerance.
