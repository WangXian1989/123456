The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're under 50, you can contribute up to $22,500 (as of 2023; check for updates) annually. If you're 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a catch-up contribution.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA after you've maximized contributions to your 401(k). For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional investing. This gives you greater flexibility and access to your money without penalties, although investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure the types of investments in each account align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. For instance, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA (which have tax advantages) while keeping more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications from withdrawals.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're years away from retirement, you might allocate more to growth investments. If retirement is approaching, you might focus on preserving capital and generating income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, the performance of your assets will likely change your allocation. Regularly review and adjust your investments to ensure that your distribution remains aligned with your objectives.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary greatly, so consulting with a financial planner can give personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Remember, these are general strategies, and your specific needs and circumstances may require a different approach. Always consider your personal financial situation and consult with a tax professional when making investment decisions.
