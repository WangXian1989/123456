I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely based on the specific condition affecting your liver. Possible treatments may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, surgery or transplantation. Always seek medical advice to determine the best course of action for your situation.
