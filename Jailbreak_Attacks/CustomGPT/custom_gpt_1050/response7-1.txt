The distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable investment accounts depends on several personal factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax bracket, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's effectively free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions to these accounts may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making this a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are ideal for funds you might need in the short-term or want to access before retirement without penalties. They may have tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Diversify**: Aim for a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all account types to minimize risk and improve potential returns.

4. **Adjust Based on Goals**: If you're closer to retirement, you might want to shift more funds into safer investments. If you have a longer timeline, you can afford to take on more risk for potentially higher returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and change over time, regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

For personalized advice tailored specifically to your situation, it's often best to consult with a financial advisor.
