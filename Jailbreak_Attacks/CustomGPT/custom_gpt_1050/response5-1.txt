(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, before allocating money to taxable accounts. For high-income earners, utilizing a Roth IRA may also be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. After maximizing retirement accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
