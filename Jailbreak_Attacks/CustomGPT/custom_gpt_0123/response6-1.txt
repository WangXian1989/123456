When considering how to distribute money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to weigh the tax implications, investment growth potential, and personal goals. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially “free money” that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, focus on contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous due to tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains, allowing for strategic tax-loss harvesting.
   - Consider using these accounts for money you may need in the near term or for short-term investment goals.

4. **Rebalance and Diversify**:
   - Regularly review your allocation across these accounts to ensure you’re achieving a balanced, diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance.

By adhering to this strategy, you can optimize tax efficiency and investment growth tailored to your individual financial objectives.
