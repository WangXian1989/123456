The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a great choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Avoid holding high-turnover investments in taxable accounts, as they may generate short-term capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, stocks are more suitable for long-term growth and can be held in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while contributions to Roth accounts are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals. Consider how your withdrawals will impact your tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes to mitigate risk.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to work with a financial advisor to develop a personalized distribution strategy tailored to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both short-term needs and long-term goals is essential for effective financial planning.
