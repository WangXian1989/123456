The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you may have tax deductions on contributions or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax, which may be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure you maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts. This can help mitigate risk and improve potential returns.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, it might be prudent to pay that down before allocating too much to retirement accounts.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Consider your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals when deciding how much to allocate to each account type.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Your financial circumstances and goals may change over time, so regularly reassess your allocations.

Itâ€™s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
