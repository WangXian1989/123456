I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. The best treatment for liver issues usually depends on the specific condition and its severity. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and weight management can significantly impact liver health. Avoiding alcohol and substances harmful to the liver is also crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, doctors might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Procedures**: In some cases, medical procedures like endoscopy might be necessary to address complications, or surgical options might be available for certain liver diseases.

4. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease or failure, a liver transplant might be the only option. 

It's vital to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment options based on your specific situation.

For more personalized guidance, please discuss your symptoms and medical history with a healthcare provider. They can offer the best advice on how to proceed.
