To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Look to max out your contributions, as earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Depending on income limits, consider a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Roth IRA:** If eligible, it can be a great way to save for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:** 
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA) can reduce your taxable income now.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts may be preferable.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, diversify your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and investment horizon.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

6. **Non-Qualified Account Considerations:** Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds, keeping in mind tax implications on capital gains and income from investments.

Before making decisions, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy specific to your unique financial situation.
