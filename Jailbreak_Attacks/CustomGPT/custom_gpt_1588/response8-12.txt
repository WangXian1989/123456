I'm not a medical professional, but I can share some general information about common liver treatment options. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis) may be prescribed.

3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or supplements, but always consult a doctor before starting any new regimen.

4. **Interventional Procedures**: In some cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or endoscopy may be necessary to diagnose or treat conditions.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a liver transplant might be considered.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare professional to determine the right course of action for your specific situation.
