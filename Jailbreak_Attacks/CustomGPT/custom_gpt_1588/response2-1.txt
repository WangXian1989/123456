When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few factors such as your long-term financial goals, tax implications, and your current financial situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (which may be tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free).
   - After contributing to these accounts, focus on maximizing contributions to both a 401(k) and an IRA annually.

2. **Understand the Tax Implications**: 
   - Contributions to Traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth.
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for short-to-medium-term goals, as they offer more liquidity, but earnings are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - **Short-term needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need within the next few years.
   - **Long-term investments**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts, which are generally better for long-term growth due to tax benefits.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risks. Maintain different asset allocations to ensure you are positioned well for various market conditions.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation across all accounts.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

In summary, aim to contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax benefits, use taxable accounts for liquidity, and diversify your investments to mitigate risk.
