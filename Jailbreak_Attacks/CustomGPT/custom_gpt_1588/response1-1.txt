To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals (if certain conditions are met). Depending on your income, you may benefit from one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are not tax-advantaged, but they allow for more flexible withdrawal options without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

2. **Investment Goals**: Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. Your risk tolerance will also influence how you distribute your investments.

3. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments might need to be. Younger investors might prioritize growth in their 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across different accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA accounts. Maximize these if possible, especially for employer-matched contributions.

A common approach is to maximize employer contributions in your 401(k), contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages, and then use taxable accounts for any additional savings or investments needed. You might want to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy based on your individual circumstances.

Remember, personal finance is nuanced and should be aligned with your long-term financial goals.
