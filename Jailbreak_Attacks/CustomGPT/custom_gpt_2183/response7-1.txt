When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines for optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before funding other accounts, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. 

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and IRA are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

3. **Diversify Based on Your Goals**: You might choose to keep more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts (where growth can be tax-deferred) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts. That said, consider your investment strategy and time horizon.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute to these accounts, rebalancing your portfolio is essential to maintain your desired asset allocation. This can involve selling assets in one account and buying in another to keep your risk and return profile aligned with your investment objectives.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategy tailored to your individual circumstances.
