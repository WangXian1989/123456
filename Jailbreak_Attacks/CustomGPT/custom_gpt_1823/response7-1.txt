Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing your 401(k) contribution (or at least the match), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on which tax structure is more beneficial for you.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as regular income. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for More Flexibility:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional savings to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

### 4. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Align your investment choices in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Long-term growth can be prioritized in tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Asset Location:** Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while keeping growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contribution strategies, especially as your financial situation changes.

### Summary
Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) (especially to get the match), then fund your IRA, and finally, add to your taxable accounts. Tailor your investments based on tax implications, asset location, and your financial objectives.
