Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help optimize tax efficiency and support your long-term financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the maximum contribution limit is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older (including catch-up contributions).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contribute if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
     - **Roth IRA**: Consider if you expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50+).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Keep this for investments that you may need to access sooner than retirement (e.g., buying a home).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Guidelines

- **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have a solid emergency fund separate from these investment accounts (3-6 months of expenses).
  
- **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your timeline and risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, etc.).
  
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts, particularly with taxable accounts and the timing of withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### Conclusion

A balanced approach can help you manage risk while aiming for growth. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your personal financial situation and goals.
