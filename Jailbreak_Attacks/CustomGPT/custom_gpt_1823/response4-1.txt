To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. 

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Adjust the asset allocation to reflect the different time horizons and tax situations of each account.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your portfolio at least annually to maintain your desired asset allocation and make adjustments as needed.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - When it comes time to withdraw, understand which accounts to take from first for tax efficiency (e.g., consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first in retirement).

It’s often helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your overall financial situation.
