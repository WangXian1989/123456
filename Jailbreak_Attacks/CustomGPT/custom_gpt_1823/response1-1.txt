Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA/Traditional IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions up front.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA options, go back to your 401(k) to contribute more up to the annual limit. This is especially beneficial if your contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, utilize taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts give you more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep an eye on the tax implications of your investments. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so you might prioritize holding investments in taxable accounts longer for tax efficiency.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**: As you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments. Reassess your strategy regularly as your financial situation and goals change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Always remember, this is a general framework—individual circumstances can vary significantly.
