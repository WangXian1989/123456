Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs have tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits. Ideal for short-term goals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term**: Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth with tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term**: Use taxable accounts for more immediate needs or flexible access.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess how much risk you're comfortable with in each account. You might opt for more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long time horizons.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay within contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions available).

6. **Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for potential tax implications when withdrawing funds, especially from taxable accounts.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to get the match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Aim for full contributions based on your tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for additional savings or to fund short-term goals.

### Regularly Review:
Adjust your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
