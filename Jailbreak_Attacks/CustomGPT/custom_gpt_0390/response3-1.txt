Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing here for flexibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Suitable for assets expected to grow significantly, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Ideal for investments that you expect to grow substantially; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate taxable income or if you need flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. **Investment Goals:**
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance:
     - **Long-Term Goals:** Higher risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - **Short-Term Goals:** Keep more liquid and conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach will help maximize growth while considering tax implications.
