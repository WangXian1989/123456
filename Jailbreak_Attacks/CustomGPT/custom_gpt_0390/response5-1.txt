To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or traditional) next. This account often has tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may incur higher taxes, such as short-term capital gains. They can also offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while keeping bonds and high-yield investments in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax rates, as this can affect where you should contribute.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
