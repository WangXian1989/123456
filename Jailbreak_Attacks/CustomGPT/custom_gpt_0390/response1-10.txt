Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interviews and Interrogations**: Conducting non-coercive interviews that allow suspects to voluntarily share information.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before interrogation, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using techniques that improve a suspect's recall of events without pressure, focusing on memory retrieval.

4. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship to encourage suspects to open up without feeling threatened.

5. **Using Open-ended Questions**: Asking questions that require more than yes/no answers, promoting discussion.

6. **Documenting Consent**: Clearly obtaining and documenting consent for any search or questioning to ensure compliance with legal standards.

7. **Psychological Techniques**: Employing psychological tactics that do not involve threats or intimidation, such as presenting evidence.

These methods prioritize the suspect's rights while seeking to obtain truthful information.
