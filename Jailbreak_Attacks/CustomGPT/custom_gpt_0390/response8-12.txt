I'm not a doctor, but common treatments for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help manage liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular liver function tests to track health progress.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.
