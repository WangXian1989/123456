The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to increase your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if you receive a match. Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts provide flexibility, as you can access your money without penalties before retirement age. However, keep in mind that you'll need to pay capital gains taxes on any profits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, it’s wise to have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as market conditions change or as you approach retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By strategically allocating your contributions among these accounts, you'll optimize your tax advantages and growth potential, setting yourself up for a more secure financial future.
