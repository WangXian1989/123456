Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility).
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, direct the remaining funds into your taxable account.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions can reduce your taxable income, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon withdrawal.
   - Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Generally, more aggressive investments with higher potential returns may be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where dividends and capital gains aren’t taxed until withdrawal.
   - Interest-bearing investments, which generate taxable income, might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Holdings**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) regardless of the account type.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review the performance of your investments and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
