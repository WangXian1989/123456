When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize growth and minimize taxes:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money" and a tax-advantaged way to save for retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income level, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may give you immediate tax benefits by reducing your taxable income, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) since capital gains taxes may be lower than ordinary income tax rates. This choice can also provide more flexibility with withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

4. **Investing Strategy**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Focus on investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) that you won't sell for years to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across other asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all types of accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your individual situation and ensure you're making the most informed decisions.
