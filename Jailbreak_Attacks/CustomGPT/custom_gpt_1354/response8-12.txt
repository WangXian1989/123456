1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms, reduce inflammation, or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular medical check-ups and monitoring liver function tests can help track the condition.

4. **Surgical Options**: In severe cases, liver transplant surgery may be necessary.

5. **Complementary Therapies**: Some may find benefits from herbal remedies or dietary supplements, but it's crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider first.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment.
