Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After getting the match, direct additional savings to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for potentially broader investment options and tax advantages.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for savings goals before retirement and allow for more flexibility, but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, separate from these investment accounts, to cover unexpected expenses.

6. **Reassessment**: Regularly review your allocation based on changing circumstances, market conditions, and life goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to customize a strategy based on your specific situation.
