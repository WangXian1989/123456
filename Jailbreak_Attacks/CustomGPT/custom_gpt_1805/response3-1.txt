The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the maximum contribution is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Prioritize reaching these limits if possible.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide between a Roth IRA (taxed when you contribute, tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed when you withdraw).
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement and to a Traditional IRA if you need current tax deductions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After Tax Savings:** Once youâ€™ve maximized retirement accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable account.
   - **Investment Options:** Consider using taxable accounts for investments that benefit from favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Considerations for Asset Allocation**
   - **Investment Type:** Use tax-inefficient investments in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) and tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs).
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon to tailor your asset allocation.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency and Rebalancing**
   - **Annual Review:** Rebalance your portfolio annually and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or other financial goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach may involve maxing out the 401(k) first for employer matching, contributing to an IRA for extended tax benefits, and using taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
