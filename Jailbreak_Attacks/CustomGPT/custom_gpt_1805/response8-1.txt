When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Income and gains grow tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: A traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: If eligible, diversifying some contributions to a Roth can hedge against future tax increases.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer greater flexibility for withdrawals and do not have early withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts.
   - **Capital Gains Treatment**: Consider long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Fund the 401(k) to the match limit**.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (consider maxing it out if you're eligible).
3. **Use taxable accounts for additional investments** after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Other Considerations:
- **Age and Retirement Goals**: Younger investors can be more aggressive with contributions to growth assets; older investors might lean more towards income-generating assets.
- **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices and fees associated with each account type.
- **Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets to optimize withdrawals and contributions.
