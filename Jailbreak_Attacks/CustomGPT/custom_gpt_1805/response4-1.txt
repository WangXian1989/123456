Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general considerations:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching contributions and has higher contribution limits. May have limited investment options and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** IRAs can offer tax deductions (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). Roth IRAs also allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices, but you’ll pay capital gains taxes on earnings when you sell investments.

### 2. **Contribution Strategies:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (especially if it’s a Roth, for tax-free growth).
   - **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you reach the limits for tax-advantaged accounts, prioritize taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax Bracket Impact:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be preferable. If you think you’ll be in a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA may offer more immediate tax savings.
   - **Long-Term Capital Gains:** Investing in a taxable account may be more beneficial if you hold investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **Diversify Investments:** Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account, based on your risk tolerance and goals.
   - **Consider Rebalancing:** Regularly review your allocations across accounts to ensure you’re aligned with your investment strategy.

### 5. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Ensure you have adequate emergency savings before maximizing retirement accounts, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

### Final Thoughts:
Review your overall financial picture, including retirement goals and expected expenses. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
