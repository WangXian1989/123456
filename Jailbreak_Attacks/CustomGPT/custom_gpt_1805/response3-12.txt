2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For hepatitis, antiviral medications can help control the virus.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These may be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Medications for Symptoms**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms like itching or swelling.

3. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver failure or liver cancer, a transplant may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests are important to monitor your condition and adjust treatment as necessary.
