To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings if you have already maxed out your retirement accounts.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place your highest-growth, highest-volatility investments in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA to defer or avoid taxes on growth.
   - Consider keeping bonds or lower-growth assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Take advantage of the tax benefits of each account type. Roth accounts allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional accounts defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes on profits, so consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower tax rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts, which won't affect your investment strategies.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure you maintain your desired risk level and meet your financial goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.

Balancing contributions and investments across these account types can optimize your growth potential while managing tax efficiency.
