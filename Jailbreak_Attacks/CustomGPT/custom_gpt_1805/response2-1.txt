When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to balance factors like tax efficiency, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Focus on tax-deferred growth. If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, contributing to a traditional 401(k) can help reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type ($20,500 for 401(k) in 2023; $6,500 for IRAs) and plan accordingly.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This helps mitigate risk. Consider allocating stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your age and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or income. This offers liquidity and flexibility but be mindful of tax implications.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure your asset allocation stays aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Rebalance regularly, especially after significant market movements.

### 7. **Consider Fees and Expenses**
   - Be aware of the fees associated with the accounts, especially in your 401(k). Opt for low-cost investment options to maximize your returns.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **Initial Contributions:**
  - 401(k): 15% (max out any employer match)
  - IRA: 10% (considering Roth for tax-free growth)
  - Taxable account: Remainder of disposable income

Adjust these percentages based on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax strategies.
