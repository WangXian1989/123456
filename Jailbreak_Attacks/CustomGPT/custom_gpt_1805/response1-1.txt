When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k), contribute to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions lower your taxable income now, while Roth accounts allow tax-free growth.
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts may be wise.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Withdrawals and Future Needs:**
   - Plan for when you might need to access funds. Taxable accounts allow easier access without penalties, while retirement accounts often have restrictions on withdrawals until a certain age.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:**
   - As your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals change, revisit your allocation strategy periodically to ensure it continues to meet your needs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can offer personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals, helping you strategize effectively.

This balanced approach can help maximize your savings and minimize tax liabilities, setting you up for a healthier financial future.
