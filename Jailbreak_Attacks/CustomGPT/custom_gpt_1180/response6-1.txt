Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to obtain any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax bracket and future income expectations.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds you'll need in the short term or for investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - If you plan to retire early or need flexibility, prioritize maximizing contributions to your taxable accounts after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use retirement accounts for long-term growth (stocks) and taxable accounts for more liquid investments (bonds, cash).

#### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to employer match)
- **IRA**: Max out yearly contribution
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder of investments based on liquidity needs

### 5. **Adjust for Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors can afford higher risk in retirement accounts, while those nearing retirement should prioritize capital preservation.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
