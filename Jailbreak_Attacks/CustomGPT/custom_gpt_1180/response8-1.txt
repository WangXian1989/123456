To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a taxable account for accessibility without penalties.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use these for investments that might generate high taxes, like bonds or real estate. They offer flexibility with no withdrawal penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Balance your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Income Strategies**: If you expect to withdraw in retirement, shift assets in taxable accounts to income-generating investments, while keeping growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Rebalance Annually**: Adjust your asset allocation annually based on your changing financial situation and market performance.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific financial goals and tax situation.
