Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (considered free money).
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions, especially if you can utilize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) & Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold, but allow for more flexibility in accessing funds.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth, using a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your tax situation, a Roth IRA may be preferable for younger investors. Balance growth with risk based on your retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for shorter-term goals or projects. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account (typically outside of retirement accounts).

### 5. **Rebalance and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and nearing retirement. 

### Conclusion
Prioritize maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions while ensuring a diversified and tax-efficient portfolio. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
