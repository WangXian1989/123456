To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this first if your employer offers a match. Consider contributing the maximum limit if feasible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs can be particularly advantageous for younger investors expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may be taxed on gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your investment choices based on the account type:
   - **401(k)**: Consider investing in target-date funds or a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Similarly, look for a diversified strategy but can lean more toward growth-oriented investments if your time horizon is long.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: In these, consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your accounts and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that takes advantage of tax benefits while ensuring your investments are aligned with your financial objectives.
