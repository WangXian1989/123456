(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions.

2. **Prioritize Tax Benefits**: Contribute to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, as these accounts can provide tax benefits that taxable accounts do not. 

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment approach across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Withdrawals and Taxes**: Plan for future tax implications. For example, traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are less tax-efficient, such as stocks held for long-term capital gains, or to hold money for short-term needs.

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your situation is also recommended.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The way you distribute your cash across those accounts seriously hinges on your situation. Hereâ€™s a snappy game plan:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer matches contributions, throw in as much as you can to grab that free money! Itâ€™s basically a no-brainer. 

2. **IRA Action**: After maxing out your 401(k) contribution, consider funding a Roth or traditional IRA next. If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth, thatâ€™s where you want to be for tax-free growth and withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: So, you've got extra cash? Thatâ€™s where taxable accounts come in. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and can hold a cocktail of investmentsâ€”keep the high-growth stuff there to minimize taxes.

4. **Balance Your Investments**: Keep your investment strategy diversified across all accounts. Stocks? Sure. Bonds? Absolutely. The trick is to spread the risk and tailor it to your life goals.

5. **Tax Planning**: Keep an eye on how withdrawals will affect your tax bill down the line. Traditional accounts? Taxed as income. Roths? Sweet tax-free withdrawals if you play your cards right.

And hey, if youâ€™re feeling lost, chatting with a financial planner could pay off big time!
