Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here's a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially "free" money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches, prioritize this to benefit from the match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for possible tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for:
   - Flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.
   - Potentially lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

4. **Consider Investment Options**: Each account may have different investment options and fees. Choose low-cost mutual funds or ETFs.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your distribution and asset allocation regularly to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner to develop a tailored strategy based on your financial situation.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
