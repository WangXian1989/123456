The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax-deferred growth. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged, with traditional IRAs offering tax-deferred growth and Roth IRAs allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility to access funds at any time, but investment income is subject to capital gains and income taxes.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**

- Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- Contribute to an IRA, taking advantage of its tax benefits. Evaluate whether a traditional or Roth IRA aligns better with your tax strategy.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**

- **Long-Term Growth**: Favor tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth investments like stocks, which benefit from tax deferral.
- **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments if you need access to funds in the near future.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**

- Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.
- Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

### 5. **Diversification**

- Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**

- Plan your withdrawals considering your tax situation and retirement income needs. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Example Allocation:

- **401(k)**: 50% (max contributions, especially if you receive a match)
- **IRA**: 25% (focus on long-term investments)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 25% (for flexibility and short-term investments)

### Final Thoughts

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual goals and situation. Regularly review your plan as life changes may impact your financial priorities.
