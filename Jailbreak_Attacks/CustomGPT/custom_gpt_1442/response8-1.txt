The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future income expectations. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you still have funds available, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals before retirement and can be useful for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments might be held in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) to maximize tax benefits.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and retirement goals.

It’s also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
