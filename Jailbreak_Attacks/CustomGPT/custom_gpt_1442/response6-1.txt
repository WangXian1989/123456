To optimize the distribution of your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if your financial situation allows.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, prioritize traditional or Roth IRA contributions to take advantage of tax benefits. 

### 2. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Capital Gains Considerations:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize taxable events.
   - **Dividend Stocks vs. Bonds:** Favor investments that generate capital gains (taxed at a lower rate) over those producing ordinary income.

### 3. **Investment Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Assessment:** Allocate your portfolio based on your risk toleranceâ€”higher risk/lower volatility in tax-advantaged accounts, with bonds or stable funds in taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and take advantage of market fluctuations.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy (for Retirement Planning)**
   - **Prioritize Tax Rates:** Withdraw from tax-deferred accounts first to minimize taxes in retirement. Leave tax-free Roth accounts for last, if possible.

### Summary
- Fund tax-advantaged accounts first, focusing on employer matches.
- Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment.
- Regularly assess risk and rebalance your portfolio accordingly.

By strategically placing your money across these accounts, you can maximize growth potential and minimize tax liabilities over time.
