The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for retirement. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA, whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be particularly advantageous for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals but may have tax implications on capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to have a mix of taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.
