The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, prioritizing the type that aligns with your tax strategy.

2. **Consider Investment Growth and Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate higher returns. This includes stocks and mutual funds, which can have higher growth potential but also greater volatility.
   - Place bonds and fixed-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. 
   - Adjust the allocation within each account type according to your comfort with risk.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investment. They offer flexibility for withdrawals.
   - Be mindful of tax-efficient investments here to minimize taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs with low turnover.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy and risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific financial situation and goals.

Always remember to consider your age, retirement timeline, and any changes in your financial situation when deciding how to allocate your contributions.
