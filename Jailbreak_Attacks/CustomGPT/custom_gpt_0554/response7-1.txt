Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for accessing the funds. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider contributing to either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've contributed enough to secure the employer match and maxed out your IRA contributions (if applicable), continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps you take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts once you've fully funded your retirement accounts. These accounts are more flexible, allowing for withdrawals at any time without penalties, but they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type. Keep in mind that tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs can help minimize tax liability in taxable accounts.

6. **Ongoing Contributions and Adjustments**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. 

Consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.
