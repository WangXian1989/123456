To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money). Aim to contribute up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions can grow tax-free, which is beneficial for long-term growth.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-risk, growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free. 
   - More stable or income-generating investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts, where taxes on dividends and interest can be managed more efficiently.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - In your taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs that generate lower capital gains.
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes on income.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time horizons can afford more risk; thus, having a higher growth allocation in tax-advantaged accounts may be advantageous.
   - Shorter time horizons might require stability, perhaps leaning towards more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals.

By following these guidelines, you'll make the most out of each account type while minimizing your tax liability and maximizing growth potential.
