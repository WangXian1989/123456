When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate your financial goals, tax considerations, investment timeframe, and overall retirement strategy. Here's a general framework you might consider for allocation:

1. **Employer-Sponsored 401(k) Plan**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's generally advisable to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize contributions if possible, as 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax (or Roth, if applicable), reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA Options**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - Depending on income limits and eligibility, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA after contributing to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can begin investing in a taxable brokerage account. This offers more flexibility regarding withdrawals without penalties.
   - Consider strategies for tax efficiency, such as holding investments long enough to qualify for capital gains tax rates and utilizing tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund and consider allocating funds for short-term goals in a more liquid form, separate from retirement accounts.

5. **Portfolio Diversification**:
   - Diversify your holdings across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Different types of accounts may hold different asset allocations (e.g., stocks, bonds, ETFs).

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

**Example Allocation Strategy**:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income, enough to maximize the employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out the contribution limit to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts can go here, focusing on tax-efficient investment options.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan based on your specific circumstances.
