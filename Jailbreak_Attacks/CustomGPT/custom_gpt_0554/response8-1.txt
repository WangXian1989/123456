To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're not maxing out your 401(k), aim to do so, especially if you have a matching program. This account offers tax-deferred growth until you withdraw during retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) (or if you don’t have one), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that generate capital gains or interest, which are taxed at the time of sale or interest accrual. This can include investments in stocks or bonds. Prioritize holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account type to mitigate risk.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment allocations based on when you plan to access the funds and your comfort with market fluctuations.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and overall investment strategy. Life changes and market conditions might necessitate adjustments.

7. **Seek Professional Guidance**: If you're unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This strategy can help you grow your assets efficiently while balancing tax considerations.
