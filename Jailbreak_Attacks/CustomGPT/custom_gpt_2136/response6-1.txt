When it comes to distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s an approach that can help optimize your investment strategy:

### 1. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also allow for pre-tax contributions, whereas Roth IRAs involve post-tax contributions, letting you withdraw tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are taxed annually and at capital gains rates upon sale.

### 2. **Determine Your Retirement Goals:**
   - Consider when you plan to retire and your expected income needs in retirement. High growth investments may be better suited in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable, income-producing assets can fit well in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Investment Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs, especially if there’s an employer match in your 401(k), as this is free money.
   - **Diversify Investment Types:** 
     - *401(k) and IRA:* Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs) that have the potential for higher returns.
     - *Taxable Accounts:* Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks, which may benefit from lower capital gains tax and provide income.

### 4. **Keep a Balanced Portfolio:**
   - Hedge against market volatility by maintaining a diversified portfolio across all accounts while taking into account the different tax treatments.

### Tips:
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.
- Consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that fits your unique situation.

This approach can help you effectively utilize your investments while minimizing tax liabilities and maximizing growth potential in line with your retirement goals.
