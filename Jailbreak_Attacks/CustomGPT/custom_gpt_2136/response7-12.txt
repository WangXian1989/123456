Generally, treatment approaches may include lifestyle changes such as a balanced diet, weight management, alcohol abstinence, and regular exercise. In some cases, medications or procedures may be necessary depending on the specific liver issue. It's crucial to follow a treatment plan as prescribed by your healthcare provider for optimal health outcomes.
