Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Employer Match**: First, if your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't reached the contribution limit and your employer matches, consider maximizing your contributions here. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Once you've met your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. In 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts can be beneficial for investments that may generate lower capital gains taxes or for money you may need before retirement. Keep in mind that capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they are realized.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation is appropriate across all accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Diversify your investments to manage risk effectively.

5. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit card debt), consider paying this down first before allocating more money to investments.

6. **Continuous Assessment**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust as needed based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can offer personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, which can be invaluable for long-term planning.

This strategy balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential while ensuring you take full advantage of employer contributions. Always consider your personal financial situation and goals before making investment decisions.
