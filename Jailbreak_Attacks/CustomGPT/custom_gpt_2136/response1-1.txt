Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are a few strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may allow you to deduct contributions from your taxes, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Optimize for Taxes:**
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income or short-term gains (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Consider Your Risk Tolerance and Goals:**
   - If you have a long time horizon and can accept more risk, you might lean towards more aggressive investments in your retirement accounts.
   - In a taxable account, consider holding more conservative investments since you may need quicker access to funds.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance your accounts to ensure youâ€™re maintaining your desired risk level across all your accounts.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Since everyone's financial situation is different, speaking with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your specific needs.

Before making any changes, ensure that you understand any potential fees or tax implications associated with your investment decisions. It's always a good idea to stay informed and plan according to your life stage and financial goals.
