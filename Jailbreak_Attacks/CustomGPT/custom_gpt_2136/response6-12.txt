I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some potential treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**
   - **Diet:** A healthy diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity to help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**
   - Prescription medications may be used depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**
   - Regular liver function tests to monitor the state of your liver.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**
   - Control related conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity.

5. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**
   - Completely avoiding alcohol and reducing exposure to harmful substances like certain medications or chemicals.

6. **Surgery**
   - In severe cases, surgical interventions such as liver transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to seek advice from a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for your specific condition.
