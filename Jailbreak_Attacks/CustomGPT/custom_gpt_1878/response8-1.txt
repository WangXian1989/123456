To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - Depending on your current income and tax bracket, prioritize contributions to accounts that provide immediate tax benefits.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA may be more advantageous, while higher earners might benefit from Traditional contributions.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and higher-risk investments (like stocks), as they grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where you might be subject to capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roths.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust Your Strategy**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance across all accounts. Adjust contributions and investments based on changing financial goals, tax laws, and life circumstances.

### Conclusion
Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a balance between taking advantage of tax benefits and ensuring investment growth. Prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider your tax situation, and periodically reassess your strategy to align with your retirement goals.
