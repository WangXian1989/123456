To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with a match; traditional or Roth options. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages. Contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; capital gains and dividends are taxable. Good for short-term needs or when you exceed contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If possible, contribute the maximum to your IRA after your 401(k) match. Consider whether a Roth or Traditional IRA is suitable based on your current and expected future tax bracket.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **After-Tax vs. Pre-Tax**: Assess your current tax situation and future income expectations. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth options. 
   - **Asset Location**: 
     - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
     - Keep bonds and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage tax impact more effectively.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. This could mean allocating a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets strategically among the accounts.
  
### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocation at least annually. Adjust your investments to maintain your desired risk level and to take advantage of market conditions.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account outside of your retirement accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

### Conclusion
Distributing your money across these accounts requires a mix of maximizing tax advantages, considering your current and future tax situations, and maintaining a well-diversified portfolio. Tailor your contributions based on your financial situation, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
