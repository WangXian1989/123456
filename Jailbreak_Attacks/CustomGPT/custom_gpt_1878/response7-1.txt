Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contribution Maximization:** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **Investment Choices:** Look for low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider putting funds here for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution:** Aim to max out annual contributions if possible, as these accounts offer tax advantages.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts allow for more liquidity and flexibility, ideal for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate fewer taxable events.

### Summary
- **Start with 401(k) contributions for any match**, then **max out IRA contributions**. Finally, allocate any extra funds to a taxable account based on your liquidity needs and expected investment horizon.
- Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a strategy tailored to your specific circumstances.
