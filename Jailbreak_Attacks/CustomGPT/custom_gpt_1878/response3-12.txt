I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on common treatments for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is crucial. Avoid alcohol and limit saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and improves liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver issue (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or other specific drugs.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease may be necessary.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, treatments like liver transplantation may be required.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some patients explore herbal supplements or alternative remedies, but these should be discussed with a physician due to potential interactions or side effects.

Always speak with a healthcare professional to determine the best approach for your specific condition.
