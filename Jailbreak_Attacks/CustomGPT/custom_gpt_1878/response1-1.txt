Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility (traditional vs. Roth), contribute to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold higher-turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid immediate tax liabilities.

3. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your investment mix aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks typically belong in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts for tax benefits.

4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual circumstances vary. A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

In summary, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider tax efficiency, and balance your overall asset allocation for optimal growth and risk management.
