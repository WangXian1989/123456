Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider fully funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and future expectations.

### 2. **Balance Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and have favorable capital gains tax rates on long-term investments.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Stock-heavy investments might be better in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or cash could be in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

### Conclusion:
Start by prioritizing contributions to maximize employer matches and tax benefits. Adjust contributions based on your investment goals and tax implications for an effective distribution strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your unique situation can further enhance this approach.
