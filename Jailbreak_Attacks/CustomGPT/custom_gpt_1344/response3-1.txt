When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, which reduces your taxable income now. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can hold a variety of investments, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold higher-growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts (like mutual funds or stocks) to defer taxes until withdrawal.

5. **Hold Tax-inefficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts if possible.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your investments to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation and goals.

This strategy aims for a balance between growth and tax efficiency, helping you to maximize your retirement savings.
