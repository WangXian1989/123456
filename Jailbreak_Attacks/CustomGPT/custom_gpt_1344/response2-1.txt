When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies for an effective approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing your contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Max Out Regular Contributions:** Contribute the maximum allowed each year.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** Use these accounts for money you might need before retirement.
   - **Consider Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Offset gains by selling investments at a loss.

### 4. **General Considerations:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Maintain an emergency fund separate from these accounts.
   - **Rebalance Periodically:** Adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Tailor a strategy specific to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By carefully planning your contributions and investment strategies for each account type, you can optimize your tax efficiency and overall retirement preparation.
