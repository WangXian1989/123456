Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Tax-Deferred Growth**: Use this account for investments that may grow significantly over time, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: A traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Diversify Investment Choices**: IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans, allowing for better diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Utilize for Short-Term Goals**: These accounts are great for investments you may want to access in the short term without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider holding investments long enough to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before funding taxable accounts.
- **Balance for Flexibility**: Maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts for unexpected expenses or opportunities.
- **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial circumstances.

### Consultation:
It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
