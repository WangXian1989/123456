When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out contributions, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket, since contributions are tax-deferred.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider this option for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a lower tax bracket now compared to retirement, a Traditional IRA could be advantageous for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account. These accounts offer flexibility and can be beneficial for long-term investments, especially if you plan to withdraw before retirement age.

### General Strategy:

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid account.
- **Tax Considerations**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Allocate a percentage based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
- **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify across asset classes to manage risk better.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
