To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liability.
   - Prioritize investments in tax-advantaged accounts for assets that are likely to generate significant income (e.g., bonds) to reduce tax exposure.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of equities and bonds in your portfolio across all account types to reduce risk and enhance returns.

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**
   - Longer time horizons can afford more risk; thus, allocate more to equities in retirement accounts.
   - In taxable accounts, you may want more stable investments, as these might be used for short-term goals.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Revisit your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and goals.

### General Allocation Tip
As a guideline, many suggest starting with a core allocation (e.g., 70% in tax-advantaged accounts and 30% in taxable) and adjusting based on personal goals, risk tolerance, and tax situations.

Always remember to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor for personalized advice!
