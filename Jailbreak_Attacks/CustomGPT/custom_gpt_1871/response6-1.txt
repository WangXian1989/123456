To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your income level.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) due to tax advantages. Consider a mix of domestic and international equities.
   - **Taxable Account**: Use this for bonds or investments that generate less frequent income, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for when you will start withdrawing from each account, as this will affect your tax situation.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio allocations at least annually to maintain your desired risk level.

By strategically utilizing each type of account, you can enhance growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
