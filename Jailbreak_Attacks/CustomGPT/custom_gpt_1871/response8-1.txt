Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-income years, prioritize contributions here, especially if you're eligible for matching.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional savings or investments.
   - Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Diversify investments in each account based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. This lowers your taxable income and can help manage your tax bracket.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be invaluable. A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.

Evaluate your priorities and adapt this general strategy to best fit your financial needs.
