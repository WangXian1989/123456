Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, current income, and tax situation. Here’s a general overview to help guide your strategy:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it's essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your contributions if you can, since contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify for a tax-deductible traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, consider contributing to these accounts to benefit from tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be especially useful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer more flexibility and maintain liquidity, but they don't provide the same tax benefits.

### Key Considerations:
- **Age & Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may focus on liquidity.
- **Tax Implications**: Consider your current tax bracket and how it may change in the future.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your financial goals—be it growth, income, or preservation of capital.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
