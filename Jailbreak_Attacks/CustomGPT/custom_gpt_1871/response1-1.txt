Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and current tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax rate during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for flexible investments but subject to capital gains taxes. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Higher Risk in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, where they have more time to recover from market fluctuations.
   - **Bonds or Less Volatile Investments in Taxable Accounts**: This is because you’ll want to minimize taxable events.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes in each account to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review**: 
   - Your situation may change, so review and adjust your allocations periodically.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.

By strategically distributing your money, you can optimize growth while managing taxes and risk.
