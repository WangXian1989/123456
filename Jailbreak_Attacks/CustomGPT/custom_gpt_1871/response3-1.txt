Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money." If your plan offers a Roth option, consider how it fits with your tax strategy.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains, qualified dividends, or tax-efficient funds. Avoid holding high-turnover mutual funds here due to potential tax implications.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, stocks are suitable for long-term growth, while bonds can be safer for near-term needs.

4. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquid savings in case of emergencies before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation.

In summary, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider tax implications for your investments, ensure a diversified portfolio, maintain liquidity for emergencies, and review your strategy regularly.
