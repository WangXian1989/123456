Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider traditional or Roth IRA contributions (up to $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50+). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions but tax on withdrawals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or for short-term savings. They don’t have tax advantages but can provide liquidity.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Generally, stocks may be better for growth in accounts with longer time horizons (like 401(k) and IRAs), while bonds and more stable investments can be good for taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly assess your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in the market or your financial situation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs and provide detailed tax strategies.

Each person's situation is different, so it's essential to assess your unique circumstances when deciding on asset distribution.
