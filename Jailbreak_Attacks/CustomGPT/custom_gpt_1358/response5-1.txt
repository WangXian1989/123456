The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, as these contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, but requires taxes on withdrawals later.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high current income, like dividends or interest, to avoid high tax rates. This is also a good place for investments you might need to access before retirement age.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified. This means holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically check your allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional guidance tailored to your specific situation and objectives.

Adjust these strategies based on your personal circumstances, such as age, income level, and retirement goals.
