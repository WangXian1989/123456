Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and retirement goals.

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
     - **401(k)**: $20,500 (2023) for individuals under 50; $27,000 if 50 or older.
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (2023) for individuals under 50; $7,500 if 50 or older.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed annually, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 4. **Investment Horizon**
   - If youâ€™re investing for retirement (20+ years away), you might lean more heavily into equities within tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping liquid assets in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification of Assets**
   - Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, paying attention to the tax implications of your investments.

### 6. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Review your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique financial situation, especially regarding tax implications.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced strategy that maximizes your retirement savings and minimizes tax liabilities.
