To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. The tax advantages of IRAs can be substantial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This can help manage risk and improve returns over time. 

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications in each account. For instance, ordinary income is taxed in 401(k) and Traditional IRA, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs and certain types of investments in taxable accounts may be more favorable.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your financial goals. Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement savings and consider taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific circumstances.
