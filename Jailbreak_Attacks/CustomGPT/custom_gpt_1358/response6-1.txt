Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors. Here are some considerations to help you make an informed decision:

### 1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax treatment to 401(k) but offers different contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, which can affect your overall return.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Establish a clear time horizon for each investment goal, as this will influence your asset allocation.

### 3. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Consider how quickly you might need access to your funds.
   - Taxable accounts are more flexible for withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type, which can affect your distribution strategy.

### Recommendations:
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA):**
  - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
  - Consider maxing out your IRA for the tax benefits.
  
- **Use taxable accounts for extra funds:**
  - Once contributions to tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, allocate additional investments in taxable accounts.

### Regular Reassessment:
- Periodically reassess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and goals.

Considering these factors will give you a robust strategy for distributing your money effectively among these accounts. If in doubt, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
