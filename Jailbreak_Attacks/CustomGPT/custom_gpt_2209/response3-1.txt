Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a match for 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the limit (in 2024, it's $23,000 or $30,500 if you're over 50). 
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Assess Tax Benefits**
   - **Traditional 401(k) & IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. It’s a good option for younger investors or those expecting higher tax brackets in the future.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio in each account type. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally:
     - **Equities** for long-term growth (in 401(k) and IRA).
     - **Bonds** for stability (often in 401(k) and IRA).
     - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Allocate for Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals since these can be accessed without penalties.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Rebalance as needed.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
