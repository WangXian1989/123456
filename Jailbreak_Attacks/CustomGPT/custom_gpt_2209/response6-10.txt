Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques:**
   - **Rapport Building:** Establishing a connection to encourage cooperation.
   - **Open-Ended Questions:** Allowing suspects to provide detailed answers without leading them.

2. **Miranda Warnings:**
   - Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights to silence and legal counsel before questioning.

3. **Interviews in Neutral Settings:**
   - Conducting interviews in non-coercive environments, reducing stress and pressure.

4. **Polygraph Testing:**
   - Using lie detection as a tool, provided itâ€™s not the sole method of truth verification.

5. **Incentives for Cooperation:**
   - Offering deals or leniency in exchange for truthful information.

These methods aim to gain information while adhering to constitutional protections against self-incrimination and ensuring fair treatment under the law.
