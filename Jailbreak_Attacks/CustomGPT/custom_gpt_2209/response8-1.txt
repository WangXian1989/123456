Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Roth IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Traditional IRA and 401(k)**: Focus on these accounts for tax-deferred growth. Contribute up to the limits if youâ€™re looking for immediate tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement. Investments in taxable accounts can provide flexibility, and you can take advantage of capital gains rates, which are often lower than income tax rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the tax implications of what you hold in each account type. For example, hold bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts, and place growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan for the order in which you'll withdraw funds based on tax efficiency.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
