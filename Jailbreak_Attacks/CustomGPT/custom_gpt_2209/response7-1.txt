Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can help optimize your retirement savings and minimize taxes. Here’s a general breakdown of strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match as it’s essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits:** Consider maximizing your contributions since 401(k) plans often have higher limits compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth) Accounts**
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be better. Conversely, if you want tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Make sure you’re aware of the annual limits and consider contributing the maximum.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals:** If you need access to your funds before retirement, a taxable account can provide liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### **General Guidelines:**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Consider Taxes:** Be aware of how each account is taxed—401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth withdrawals are tax-free.

### **Sample Distribution Strategy:**
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions.
3. Direct any additional savings into your taxable account for flexibility.

### **Regular Review:**
Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.

By balancing contributions across these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
