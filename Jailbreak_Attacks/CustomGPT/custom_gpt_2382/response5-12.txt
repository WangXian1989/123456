I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, common treatment options include:

1. **Lifestyle changes:** Healthy diet, weight management, regular exercise.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for inflammation.
3. **Supportive care:** Managing symptoms and regular monitoring.
4. **Avoiding alcohol:** Essential for liver health.
5. **Liver transplant:** In severe cases.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
