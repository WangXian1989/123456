To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA (Roth or Traditional) for tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts for lower capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets for risk management across all accounts.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on your long-term goals and risk tolerance when distributing funds.
