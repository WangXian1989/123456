The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your IRA and 401(k) for their tax advantages. This can help grow your wealth more efficiently.

3. **Diversify in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are favorable for capital gains or qualified dividends, and maintain liquidity for short-term goals.

4. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type and plan your distributions accordingly.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your investment allocations reflect your risk tolerance and goals by rebalancing your portfolio as needed.
