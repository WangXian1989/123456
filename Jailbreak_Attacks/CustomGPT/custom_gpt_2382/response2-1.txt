Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first; it's free money!

2. **Utilize Tax Advantages**: Contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and retirement goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for shorter-term goals or if youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Tax Impact**: Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, so balance them with tax-advantaged accounts.
