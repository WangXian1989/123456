It's important to allocate your money strategically between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available.

2. **Tax Advantages:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like IRA and 401(k) for retirement savings, as they grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an accessible emergency fund in a taxable account before locking up funds in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification:** Consider a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts, keeping in mind tax implications for taxable accounts.

5. **Long-Term Goals:** Align contributions with your long-term financial goals and time horizon.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies!
