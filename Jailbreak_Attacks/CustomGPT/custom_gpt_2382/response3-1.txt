Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA and 401(k) for tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Keep a mix of asset types in each account to balance risk and return.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund in easily accessible accounts before full investing.
