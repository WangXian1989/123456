Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Utilizing non-coercive techniques like rapport-building to create a comfortable environment for the suspect.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, emphasizing the benefits of cooperation.

4. **Interview Strategies**: Employing open-ended questions to encourage conversation without pressure, allowing suspects to share information freely.

5. **Deception Detection**: Using behavioral analysis and cognitive interviewing techniques to identify truthful responses without intimidation.

These methods focus on obtaining information ethically while protecting suspects' rights.
