When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

4. **Balance for Taxes**: Consider your current and expected tax brackets to optimize where you put your moneyâ€”tax-deferred accounts can help in higher income years.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types across accounts to manage risk and return.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for a personalized strategy.
