When considering how to distribute your money among retirement accounts like a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of the best practices for each account type to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, it’s usually wise to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages of IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

3. **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA if your budget allows. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA ($7,500 if you’re age 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've hit the contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This could be beneficial for goals you wish to achieve before retirement, offering more liquidity and fewer penalties for withdrawals.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Diversify your investments both within and across accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to appreciate significantly (to minimize capital gains taxes on withdrawal) and keep more stable investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations and contributions in response to changes in tax laws, your financial situation, or your retirement goals. 

It’s recommended to talk to a financial advisor to receive personalized advice based on your particular circumstances.
