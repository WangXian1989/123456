When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies: 

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider the tax impact when investing in these accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds), while keeping investments with the most potential for growth (like stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate savings account outside of these investment vehicles for short-term needs without penalties when accessing funds.

5. **Regular Contributions**: 
   - Set up automatic contributions to all your accounts to ensure consistent investing over time.

6. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
