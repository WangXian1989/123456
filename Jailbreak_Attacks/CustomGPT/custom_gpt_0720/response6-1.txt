To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand the Tax Implications:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on them until you withdraw funds in retirement. This strategy benefits individuals looking to lower their taxable income now and potentially pay a lower rate in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale and dividends taxed as ordinary income. This is crucial for creating liquidity and accessibility to funds without penalties.

### 2. Determine Your Investment Goals:
   - **Retirement Savings**: Max out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) up to employer match, then IRA) since these provide the most tax benefits.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate excess funds to taxable accounts for flexibility without penalties, allowing quicker access to your investments.

### 3. Suggested Contribution Strategy:
   - **Max Out 401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: After reaching your match in the 401(k), consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation).
   - **Use Taxable Accounts**: Finally, any additional savings can be placed into taxable accounts to ensure liquidity for short-term goals.

### 4. Asset Allocation:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of stock and bond funds, tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Similarly, invest in a diversified portfolio adjusted for retirement timing, possibly favoring stocks if you are younger.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments, as you may need to access these funds sooner, and be mindful of the tax implications of capital gains.

### Conclusion:
- Use tax-advantaged accounts to your advantage up to the maximum allowable contributions.
- Keep an eye on your liquidity needs to strike a balance between retirement saving and accessible funds. 

This strategic approach ensures optimal growth potential while minimizing tax burdens and maintaining liquidity. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized plan.
