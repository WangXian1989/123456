I'm not a doctor, but it's really important that you consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Factors such as the type of liver problem, its severity, and your overall health will determine the best course of action. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in more severe cases, surgical interventions. Please seek medical advice for accurate information tailored to your needs.
