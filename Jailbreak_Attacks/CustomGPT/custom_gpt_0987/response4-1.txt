Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it next for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you prefer tax deductions now, consider a traditional IRA.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out any matches and contributing to an IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k), focusing on tax-advantaged growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money needed in the short term or for investment options that may not be available in retirement accounts. This is also useful for tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, consider a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to grow without immediate tax concerns.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan a withdrawal strategy that minimizes taxes, such as using taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

It's advisable to periodically review your investment strategy, especially as your circumstances change. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
