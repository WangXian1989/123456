Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to your IRA. Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for maximum contributions, especially if you are in a high tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings that you might need in the short term or for specific financial goals, such as buying a home.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth options. If you think your tax rate will be lower, consider traditional accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. For long-term investments, equities might be more suitable, while bonds might fit better in taxable accounts for income generation.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust your allocations as needed, ensuring alignment with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner who can tailor recommendations to your specific situation.

This distribution strategy promotes tax efficiency while helping grow your savings for future needs.
