I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general approaches to managing liver issues. However, it's crucial you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options that might be recommended:

1. **Medication**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Corticosteroids**: May be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in sugar and unhealthy fats can benefit liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Blood Tests**: To monitor liver function and check for damage.
   - **Imaging Tests**: Ultrasounds or CT scans to assess liver structure.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**:
   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: Essential for recovery in cases of alcoholic liver disease.
   - **Avoiding Medications and Substances**: That can further harm the liver.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, options such as liver transplantation may be considered.

Always follow up with your healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your condition.
