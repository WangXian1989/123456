Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing any employer contributions, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Depending on your income and tax situation, choose a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Use Your 401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) after the IRA, especially if you’re close to the annual contribution limits. This gives you tax-advantaged growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts. They provide more liquidity and flexibility, especially if you might need access to funds before retirement.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. You might want to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts where interest income is taxed at ordinary rates.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
