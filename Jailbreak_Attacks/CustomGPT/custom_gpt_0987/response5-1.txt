(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. 

1. **401(k)**: Often provides employer matching contributions, which can be a great way to boost your retirement savings. Maximize contributions to take full advantage of any match.

2. **IRA**: Regular IRAs and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments outside of retirement accounts. They provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! Finding the perfect way to juggle your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is kinda like playing a game of financial Tetris. It all depends on your goals and how much you like tax breaks!

1. **401(k)**: If your employer is tossing in a match, itâ€™s like free money! Max that puppy out before moving on. Get all the free cash you can!

2. **IRA**: If youâ€™re eyeing a Roth IRA, think long-term gainsâ€”tax-free withdrawals down the line! Regular IRAs can be a great option too, especially for tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you can play a little more freely. It's easier access to your cash, but watch out for taxes on gains. Keep it tax-efficient with funds that wonâ€™t eat into your returns too much.

Mix it all based on your income, if you're planning for early retirement or just want a safety net. Honestly, chat with a financial advisor if you want a game plan that wonâ€™t leave you hanging!
