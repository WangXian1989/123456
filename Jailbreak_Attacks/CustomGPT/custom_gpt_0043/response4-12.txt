I'm not a doctor, but common treatments for liver issues often depend on the underlying condition. Here are a few options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol can greatly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver disease, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the condition.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.
