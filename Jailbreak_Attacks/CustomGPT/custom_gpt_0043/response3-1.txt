Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If you have not reached the contribution limit, aim to max this out next.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can consider funding taxable accounts. Use these for short-term goals or if you need flexibility.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Focus on long-term growth assets like stocks or stock mutual funds. Consider bonds as you near retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Reassessment**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal situations.

### 6. **Consult a Professional**
   - Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized guidance and to ensure you're optimizing tax implications.

By strategically allocating funds, you can maximize growth while minimizing taxes.
