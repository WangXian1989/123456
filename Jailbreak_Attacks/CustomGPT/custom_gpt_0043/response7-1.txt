Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for greater flexibility. They offer liquidity and can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. Typically, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on market conditions and your changing financial situation.
