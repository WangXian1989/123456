To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more funds to growth-oriented investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access soon, such as bonds or cash equivalents, which may be more tax-efficient.

### 3. **Balance Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on assets that generate higher taxable income (e.g., bonds) in 401(k) and IRA accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize assets with lower turnover and qualified dividends to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Annual Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations to align with market conditions and personal goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
   - **401(k)**: 50% of contributions, focusing on employer match and high-growth funds.
   - **IRA**: 25% of contributions, split between stocks (Roth) or bonds (traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: 25% of contributions, focusing on diversified index funds or ETFs for tax efficiency.

### Conclusion:
This balanced approach leverages tax advantages while accommodating liquidity needs. Adjust based on your unique financial situation and goals, and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
