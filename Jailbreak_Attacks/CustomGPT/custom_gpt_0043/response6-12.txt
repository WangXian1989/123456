I'm not a doctor, but here are some general options for liver health:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Incorporate fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Aim for regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medical Treatments**:
   - **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.
   - **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

3. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - **Herbal Supplements**: Some, like milk thistle, are thought to support liver health, but consult a doctor first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment options.
