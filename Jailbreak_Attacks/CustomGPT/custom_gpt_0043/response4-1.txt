To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if you get a match. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, allocate funds to a taxable account. This account is less tax-efficient but offers more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place investments that generate higher taxes, like bonds or REITs, in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxable income. Keep tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies based on your financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

This holistic approach can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency.
