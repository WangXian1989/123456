To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out IRA contributions**: If eligible, prioritize your IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maxing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k).

3. **Consider Investment Horizons**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments like stocks or mutual funds.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Shorter-Term Goals**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

4. **Tax-Efficient Investing**:
   - Hold bond funds and other interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for long-term capital gains investments, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

This balanced approach can help optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
