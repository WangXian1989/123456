Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and current age. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA, especially a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Use tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

### 5. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15% to reach the match
- **IRA:** Max out contributions annually
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can go here, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions depends on individual circumstances—including tax implications and retirement goals—so a tailor-made plan can help optimize your strategy.
