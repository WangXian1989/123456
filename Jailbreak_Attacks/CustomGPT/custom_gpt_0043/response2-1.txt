To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth) based on your current and expected future tax rate.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use your taxable account for investments you expect to hold short-term or those that generate high taxable income (like bonds).
   - Keep long-term investments, especially those that can appreciate in value, in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, such as holding stocks (which benefit from lower capital gains tax) in taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investment choices with your goals—retirement, purchasing a home, etc.—and how long you have until you need the funds.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your asset allocation across your accounts to maintain your desired risk profile.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and specific investment choices, a financial advisor can provide tailored insights.

With these strategies, you can create a balanced, tax-efficient portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.
