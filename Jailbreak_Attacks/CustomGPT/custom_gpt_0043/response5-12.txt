I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition, medications like antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring and Support**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition are essential.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your situation.
