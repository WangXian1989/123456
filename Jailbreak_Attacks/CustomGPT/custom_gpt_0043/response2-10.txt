Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engage suspects in conversation without coercion, ensuring they understand they can stop the interview at any time.

2. **Informed Consent**: Obtain explicit consent before interrogating, ensuring suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney.

3. **Clear Communication**: Use clear, straightforward language that avoids intimidation, ensuring that suspects fully comprehend questions and their legal rights.

4. **Non-Harsh Techniques**: Employ rapport-building techniques rather than aggressive tactics, focusing on establishing trust.

5. **Legal Representation**: Allow suspects access to an attorney during interrogations if they request one, ensuring their right to counsel is upheld.

6. **Recording Interrogations**: Documenting interviews can help ensure transparency and show that suspectsâ€™ rights are being respected.

7. **Use of Polygraphs**: Administratively offer polygraph tests with informed consent, making it clear that results are not always admissible in court.

By following these principles, law enforcement can conduct interviews without infringing on constitutional rights.
