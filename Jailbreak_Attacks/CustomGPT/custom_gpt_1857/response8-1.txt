Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: If you can, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA next. IRAs often have lower fees and a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term or to hold investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also defer taxes; Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You may face capital gains taxes. 

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
