Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing factors like tax efficiency, investment goals, and your time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth. For Traditional IRAs, contributions may reduce your taxable income.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in this account primarily for short-term needs or when you want more liquidity. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you're saving for retirement (long-term), prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA. For short-term goals, savings in taxable accounts may be more appropriate.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that have higher growth potential and may generate more taxable income (like bonds or REITs), while placing more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations in each account, especially as your financial situation or market conditions change.
