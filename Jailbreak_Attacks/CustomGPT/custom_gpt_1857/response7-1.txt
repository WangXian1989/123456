Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations to optimize your investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understanding Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offers potential employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Best for contributions if your employer matches.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Provides tax advantages. Traditional IRAs may allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible and can be accessed anytime, but taxes are due on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributionsâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Fund IRAs:** Consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 3. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks may offer better growth potential, while bonds provide stability.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRAs) to avoid higher taxes.

### 4. **General Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Aggressive Approach:** Consider a higher allocation to equities in your 401(k) and IRA if you have a longer time horizon and can handle volatility.
   - **Stable Investments:** Use taxable accounts for more stable assets that generate predictable income, potentially to minimize taxes on high-yield investments.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
