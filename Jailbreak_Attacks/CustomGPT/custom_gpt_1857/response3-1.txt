Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, depending on the type.

   - **401(k)**: Contribute the annual maximum if possible ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you’re over 50). Check if you have a Roth 401(k) option for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (limit of $6,500, or $7,500 if 50+ for 2024). A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, though they won’t provide the same tax advantages.

4. **Consider Time Horizon**: The closer you get to retirement, the more you might shift towards less risky investments. For long-term growth, equities in tax-advantaged accounts are typically preferred, while keeping more liquid and accessible investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) and avoid short-term capital gains, which are taxed at higher rates.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
