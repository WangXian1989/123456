To optimize your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Max Out Contributions**: Prioritize maxing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits.

2. **401(k) First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match; it's free money.

3. **IRA Next**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. Choose between traditional (tax-deductible) and Roth (tax-free growth) based on your current and expected future tax situation.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money beyond your retirement accounts. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Balance higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts and safer investments in taxable accounts to reduce tax liabilities.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your strategy periodically to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.

This approach maximizes growth potential while minimizing tax impacts over time.
