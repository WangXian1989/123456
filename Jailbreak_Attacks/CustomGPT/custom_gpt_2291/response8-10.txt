Law enforcement can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Use rapport-building methods to encourage suspects to talk willingly.
2. **Open-Ended Questions**: Ask questions that allow suspects to provide detailed responses rather than simple yes or no answers.
3. **Miranda Rights**: Ensure suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and consult an attorney before questioning.
4. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: Employ psychological techniques to create a dynamic that encourages cooperation without coercion.
5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence can prompt suspects to provide explanations or confessions voluntarily.
6. **Polygraph Tests**: Although not universally accepted, they can encourage suspects to be truthful if they believe they will be tested.
7. **Building Trust**: Establishing a non-confrontational environment may lead to voluntary disclosures.
8. **Informed Consent**: Obtain consent for interviews or searches to ensure compliance with legal standards.

These methods must adhere to laws and ethical standards to prevent infringement on suspects' rights.
