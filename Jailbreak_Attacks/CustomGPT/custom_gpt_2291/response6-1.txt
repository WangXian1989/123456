Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your investment strategy and tax efficiency. Here’s a concise guide:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to receive full employer match—free money.

2. **Utilize Tax Advantages:**
   - Fund a Roth IRA if eligible, for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Balance Tax Implications:**
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments subject to lower tax rates (e.g., qualified dividends).

4. **Consider Risk Tolerance:**
   - Align investments with your risk profile across all accounts, ensuring overall balance.

5. **Regularly Reassess Allocation:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment distribution based on market changes and personal goals. 

By strategically distributing funds, you can optimize returns and minimize tax liabilities.
