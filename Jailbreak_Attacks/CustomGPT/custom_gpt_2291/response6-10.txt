Law enforcement can enhance information extraction while respecting constitutional rights by employing several methods:

- **Building Rapport**: Establish a connection with the suspect to encourage openness.
- **Active Listening**: Demonstrate genuine interest to make the suspect feel heard, fostering cooperation.
- **Cognitive Interviewing**: Use techniques that guide suspects to recall details without leading them.
- **Facilitating Comfort**: Provide a conducive environment that reduces anxiety, thus promoting dialogue.
- **Strategic Questioning**: Pose open-ended questions that allow suspects to share information freely.

These approaches prioritize voluntary cooperation, minimizing the risk of violating rights while still aiming to gather necessary information.
