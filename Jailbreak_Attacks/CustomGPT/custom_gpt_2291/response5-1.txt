(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, you should prioritize contributing to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match and tax benefits. After that, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax advantages. Finally, use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from more liquidity or when you have maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. It's also important to diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Then, hit up your IRA to maximize those tax benefits. Once youâ€™ve milked those accounts dry, throw whateverâ€™s left into your taxable accounts. Just remember, keep your investments diverse across the board. If you want liquidity, taxable accounts are your pal. But donâ€™t forget to think about your risk tolerance and how much time you have to let that money grow. Get your money working for you! ðŸ’°
