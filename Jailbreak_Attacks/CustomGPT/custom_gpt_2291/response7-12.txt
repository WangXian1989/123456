I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options that may be recommended for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any progression of disease.
4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan.
