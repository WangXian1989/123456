For liver problems, treatment options depend on the specific condition, but common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, exercise, and avoid alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Use drugs to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).
3. **Weight Management**: If overweight, losing weight can improve liver health.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.
