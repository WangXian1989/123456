Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Fund your tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA) more if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Consider Roth contributions if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement; this allows for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, invest in a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts due to the longer time until withdrawal.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Keep some investments in taxable accounts for flexibility. This will allow for withdrawals without penalties and access to funds for short-term goals.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan the order of withdrawals from each account type during retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help manage tax liability.

### Conclusion:
Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on your financial goals, income changes, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
