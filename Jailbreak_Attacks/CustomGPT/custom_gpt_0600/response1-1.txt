Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, a taxable account can be a good option. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when trading in these accounts.

4. **Investment Choices**: Within each account, diversify your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

Adjust these strategies based on your unique circumstances, such as age, income, and retirement goals.
