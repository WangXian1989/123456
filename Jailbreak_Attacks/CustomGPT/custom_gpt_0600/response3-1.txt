Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA, especially a Roth IRA, since qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Growth is tax-deferred; consider placing higher-growth investments here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower taxable income (like bonds) or if you may need access to funds before retirement.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - If saving for long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile and reflect any changes in financial goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
