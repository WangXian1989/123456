Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; then aim to max it out. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider either a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Choose based on your current tax rate versus expected future rate.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient options (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax. Hold investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-deferred growth in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For short-term goals, focus on liquid investments in your taxable account.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more to equities if you have a long time horizon and higher risk tolerance. A mix of stocks and bonds can be beneficial as you near retirement.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice from a professional can help tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances and goals.

This approach balances tax advantages, investment growth, and liquidity needs.
