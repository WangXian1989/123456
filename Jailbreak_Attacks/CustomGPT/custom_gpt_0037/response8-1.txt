To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for higher contribution limits and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth based on your tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment flexibility and emergency funds, focusing on investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investment choices are diversified and align with your risk tolerance across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Keep some liquid assets in your taxable account for emergencies before fully investing.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
