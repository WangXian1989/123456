Distributing your money between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is effectively free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Good for those in higher tax brackets now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it's often beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes. Useful for short-term goals or if you expect to need funds before retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Horizons**:
   - For long-term investments (retirement), lean more towards tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For mid- to short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts for flexibility.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, index funds) based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly reassess your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, and life events.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
