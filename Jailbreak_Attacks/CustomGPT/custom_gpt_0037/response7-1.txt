Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For retirement savings (like a 401(k) and IRA), focus on long-term growth and can afford more risk.
   - Use taxable accounts for more accessible funds, keeping in mind potential capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to balance risk. Make sure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on market performance, changes in your goals, or risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy based on your specific situation and goals.

Following these strategies can enhance your financial growth and optimize your tax situation.
