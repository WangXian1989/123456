Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your goals and financial situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth. Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA**:
   - Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider your future tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth.
   - Diversify your investments in mutual funds or ETFs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies before maximizing retirement accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your investment strategy based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals.
