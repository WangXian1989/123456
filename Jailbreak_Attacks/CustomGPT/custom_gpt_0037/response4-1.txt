To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k) with tax-deferred growth; taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth assets (like stocks) to maximize tax benefits.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If retirement is far off, prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize compounding.
   - As retirement nears, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on market performance and your risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help align your investment strategy with your financial goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money effectively.
