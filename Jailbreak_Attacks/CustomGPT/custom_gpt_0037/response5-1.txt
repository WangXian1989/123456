Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires balancing tax implications, investment growth, and liquidity. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential deductions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Best for long-term growth; you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or accessible funds; taxed on capital gains and dividends.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Riskier investments (like stocks) can be prioritized in tax-deferred accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Conservative investments (like bonds) might fit better in taxable accounts to manage tax impact.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep some cash or liquid assets in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- Maximize your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Fully fund your IRA (Roth or Traditional).
- Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts based on short vs. long-term needs.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
