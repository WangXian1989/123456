Law enforcement can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Skilled interviewing methods focus on building rapport, using open-ended questions, and active listening.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before any interrogation starts, particularly the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

3. **Consent**: Seeking voluntary consent to search property or ask questions, ensuring the suspect understands their rights.

4. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, they can be used in some situations to assess truthfulness if the suspect agrees.

5. **Informants**: Utilizing information from credible informants who may provide leads without directly interrogating suspects.

6. **Surveillance and Forensic Evidence**: Gathering evidence through legal surveillance methods and forensic analysis.

7. **De-escalation Techniques**: Using non-confrontational approaches to encourage suspects to talk voluntarily.

By adhering to these methods, law enforcement can gather information while upholding legal and ethical standards.
