Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributing to your IRA or Roth IRA if eligible. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term savings.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Once you’ve maximized your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k), especially if you’re still eligible for matching funds.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They provide flexibility for withdrawals and diverse investment options.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your investment strategy. Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free, and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

6. **Revisit Annually**:
   - Regularly review your contributions and investment allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 15% for company match, aim to max out annually.
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Fund with any remaining savings.

### Considerations
- Evaluate your current tax bracket and future tax expectations.
- Think about your retirement timeline and liquidity needs.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice. 

Always make sure to stay informed about changes in contribution limits or tax laws that may impact your strategy.
