Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Once you reach the match limit, reassess your contribution levels.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you're in a higher current tax bracket, a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity since they donâ€™t have withdrawal restrictions like retirement accounts.
   - Consider investments in taxable accounts that are tax-efficient, such as ETFs or index funds.

4. **Evaluate Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. 
   - Keep more volatile investments in accounts with tax advantages and allocate more stable investments to taxable accounts.

5. **Tax-Loss Harvesting in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts to sell losing investments to offset capital gains, thus managing your tax liability.

6. **Maintain a Diverse Portfolio**:
   - Ensure that you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across different accounts to spread risk.

In summary, prioritize maximizing contributions where possible, understand the tax implications of each account type, and maintain a well-diversified, well-allocated portfolio throughout all investment types. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
