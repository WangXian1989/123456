(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth based on your tax situation). These accounts provide tax advantages that can significantly benefit your long-term growth.

3. **Fund Taxable Accounts After Advantageous Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible but do not offer the same tax benefits as retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Depending on your income, it may be advantageous to contribute to a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) or traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions). Adjust your contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

5. **Balance Investments**: Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy to maintain a balanced overall portfolio.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to distribute your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and those pesky taxable accounts ultimately hinges on your financial goals and life circumstances. Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **401(k) Hustle**: First, milk every drop of your employer's match on that sweet 401(k). If youâ€™re not doing that, youâ€™re straight-up leaving money on the table! After securing that, toss as much as possible in there for tax-deferred growthâ€”who needs Uncle Sam snooping around on your gains?

2. **IRA Playground**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) match, pivot to your IRA. Figure out which flavor suits youâ€”traditional or Rothâ€”and dive in. If youâ€™ve got a Roth, enjoy the tax-free withdrawals down the line. Pump in cash until you hit the limit. 

3. **Taxable Account Chill**: Only after youâ€™ve filled those tax-advantaged beasts should you dip into taxable accounts. Yeah, the gains are taxed, but the liquidity is sexy. Invest what you need for short-term goals here and keep an eye on your tax billâ€”itâ€™s always lurking!

4. **Tax Ninja Moves**: Also, remember to adjust your strategy based on whether youâ€™ll be climbing the income ladder or chilling on the lower rungs. The game changes if you expect to be richer laterâ€”Roth might be your jam!

5. **Diversify Like a Boss**: And donâ€™t just throw your money in one basket! Spread your investments across these accounts while keeping an eye on risk and growth. Balance is key, my friend!
