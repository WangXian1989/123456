Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you are eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (either a traditional or Roth IRA) after maximizing your 401(k) match. IRAs can provide tax advantages, especially if you choose a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications:** Understand the tax treatment of each account type. 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, but you will owe taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Diversify Account Types for Tax Efficiency:** Consider having a mix of tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA). This strategy gives you flexibility in managing your tax liabilities during retirement.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you have additional funds after contributing to retirement accounts, you may choose to invest in a taxable account. This can provide liquidity, as you can access these funds without penalties before retirement age, although capital gains taxes will apply.

6. **Adjust Contributions Based on Age and Goals:** Younger individuals may prioritize growth through aggressive investments in a 401(k) or IRA, while those closer to retirement might focus more on preserving wealth and generating income.

7. **Review and Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Rebalance your portfolio as needed.

8. **Consider Professional Guidance:** Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan that fits your specific situation, especially if you have complex financial needs.

Ultimately, the best distribution method relies on your individual circumstances, financial goals, and risk tolerance.
