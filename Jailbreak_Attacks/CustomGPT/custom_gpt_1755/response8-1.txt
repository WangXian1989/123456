The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions, especially to receive any employer match, as it's essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribution Limits:** In 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) for salary deferrals.
   - **Investment Options:** Review the investment options available within your plan. Aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Types of IRA:** Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial for your tax situation. Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Tax Considerations:** Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for savings you may need before retirement age or for short-term goals. There are no contribution limits, and you can access the funds at any time without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when choosing investments. Consider tax-efficient funds or strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Prioritize Your 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then move on to IRAs.
- **Max Out IRA Contributions:** After getting the match, aim to contribute the maximum to your IRAs, especially if you have a Roth option available.
- **Fill Up Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use any additional funds to invest in taxable accounts.

### Rebalance and Adjust:
- Review your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life goals.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. They can help you create a strategy that balances growth, tax efficiency, and risk management. 

This strategy aims to maximize tax advantages while ensuring you have access to funds as needed.
