The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. This typically should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The choice between the two often depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Assess your taxable accounts**: If you still have money left to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. Keep in mind that dividends and capital gains will be taxed in the year they are realized, unlike contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment strategy is diversified across all accounts. Different accounts may hold different types of investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax implications**: Consider the tax implications of your investments in each account type. Generally, investment income is taxed at a lower rate in taxable accounts compared to ordinary income in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Withdrawal strategies**: Be mindful of how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. It's typically advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your unique circumstances. They can help optimize your allocation based on tax considerations, investment goals, and retirement plans.
