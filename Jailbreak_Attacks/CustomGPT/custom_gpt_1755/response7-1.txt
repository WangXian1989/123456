(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year. Traditional IRAs also offer tax advantages, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Consider your current and future tax bracket when deciding how much to contribute to each account.

3. **Diversify Investment Choices**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at a lower rate. Reserve accounts with higher growth potential for your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounded growth without immediate tax impacts. 

4. **Emergency Funds and Liquidity**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts, as early withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties.

It's essential to assess your unique financial situation, possibly consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
