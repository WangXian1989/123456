(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common strategy is to prioritize contributions based on the tax advantages and employer matches available. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing to your 401(k) at least enough to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). IRAs often have different investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Max out Your 401(k)**: If you have additional funds available after contributing to your IRA, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are particularly useful for flexibility in accessing funds before retirement age and for potential capital gains.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances.

1. **Score That Employer Match**: First thingâ€™s first, shove as much as you can into your 401(k) to grab that sweet employer matchâ€”it's free money, for crying out loud!

2. **Hit Up the IRA**: Once youâ€™ve snatched that match, it's time to throw some dough into an IRA. Preferably a Roth if you can swing it, because tax-free withdrawals in retirement are like hitting the jackpot!

3. **Go Big on the 401(k)**: If youâ€™re still rolling in cash, crank that 401(k) up to the max limit. Donâ€™t leave any potential growth on the table!

4. **Taxable Accounts â€“ The Wild West**: Finally, once youâ€™re maxing out the other options, dive into your taxable accounts for some flexibility. They give you access without the retirement age strings attached.

Bottom line? Mix it up based on your tax situation and future goals. And hey, a financial advisor can be a good buddy in this money game, so consider reaching out!
