Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline for considering how to allocate your contributions:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Why?**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 3. **Back to 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing your match, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you’re aiming to save aggressively for retirement.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Why?**: These accounts provide flexibility since you can access your money without penalties (unlike retirement accounts). This is important for intermediate and short-term goals.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial initially, while a Roth can be advantageous if you’re looking to reduce your taxable income in the future.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 7. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio allocation in all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Summary
A balanced approach typically looks like:
- Max out employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA based on tax implications.
- Supplement contributions with a taxable account for flexibility.

### Conclusion
The best distribution combines maximizing employer contributions, utilizing tax advantages, and ensuring liquidity for financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor is a good idea for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
