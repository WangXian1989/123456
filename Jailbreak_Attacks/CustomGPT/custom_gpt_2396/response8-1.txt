Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be a great way to grow tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. This may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - Allocate your investments differently across your accounts according to their tax treatment. Usually, it is beneficial to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a separate savings account for emergencies so you are not forced to withdraw from your retirement or taxable accounts prematurely.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - As market conditions and personal circumstances change, review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation and goals.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while considering your current and projected future tax situation. Regular review and adjustments based on your evolving needs and market conditions are also essential for effective money distribution.
