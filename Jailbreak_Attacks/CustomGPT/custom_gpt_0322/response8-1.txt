Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors like tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) after taking advantage of the match.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Use taxable accounts to offset gains with losses.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account, separate from these investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you get closer to retirement, consider where you plan to withdraw from first, as tax implications will vary.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.
