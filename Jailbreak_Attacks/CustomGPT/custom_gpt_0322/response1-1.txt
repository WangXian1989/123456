To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on high-growth investments because withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Choose based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Focus on income-generating assets like stocks for long-term growth.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a well-diversified asset allocation across all accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Contribute consistently to all accounts, adjusting as necessary based on performance and market conditions.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly assess your allocation and adjust to stay aligned with your investment goals.

7. **Consult Professionals**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
