To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Traditional accounts will be taxed as ordinary income upon distribution.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest for broader flexibility, but be aware of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year. Consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for favorable tax treatment.

3. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - Prioritize high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Consider holding more stable investments in taxable accounts for easier access and lower turnover.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically during retirement to minimize tax impacts, potentially delaying withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts as long as possible.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your funds while considering tax implications and growth potential. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
