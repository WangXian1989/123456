Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### General Guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (traditional or Roth) for tax benefits.
   - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth if you meet certain criteria.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Balance Your Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement, as they offer more flexibility and liquidity.

### Suggested Distribution:

- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider allocating additional contributions based on your tax situation and retirement goals.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or to a traditional IRA for a tax deduction.
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional growth.

### Periodic Review:

- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on life changes, investment performance, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific circumstances.
