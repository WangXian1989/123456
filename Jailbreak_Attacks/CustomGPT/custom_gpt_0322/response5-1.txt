Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and overall retirement strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in a taxable account for short-term goals or to maintain flexibility with withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage capital gains effectively.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) and hold higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts may benefit you more. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, prioritize Roth accounts.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Reevaluate your distribution regularly based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (max to match)
- **IRA**: Invest up to the maximum allowed
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds or for specific savings goals
