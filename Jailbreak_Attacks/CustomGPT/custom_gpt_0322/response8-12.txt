I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications can manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant or other surgical interventions may be necessary.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from substances that could worsen liver damage, like certain medications and supplements.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
