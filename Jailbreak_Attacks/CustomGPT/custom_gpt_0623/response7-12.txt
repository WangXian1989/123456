I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with a liver problem, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. In some cases, medication may be required, and in severe situations, procedures or surgeries might be necessary. Always seek guidance from a qualified physician who can assess your condition and recommend the best course of action.

Stay as Omega.
