Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a savings account before investing.

2. **401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket now and expect to be in a higher bracket later.

3. **IRA**: 
   - Depending on your income, consider a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - Aim to maximize your IRA contributions as well, as these accounts have tax advantages.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that you may need access to before retirement or for strategic tax purposes, such as holding investments for a longer period to benefit from capital gains tax rates.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.

5. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique circumstances.
