When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your current tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you make decisions:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if you are in a high tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **Traditional or Roth IRA**:
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial as contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or for investments you may want to access before retirement.
   - Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - You may want to hold different types of investments in each account type based on their tax implications. For example, high-growth stocks might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds could be allocated in taxable accounts if their income is taxed at a higher rate.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to ensure that it aligns with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to tailor a distribution strategy that takes into account your specific financial situation and goals.

In summary, the best distribution strategy often involves prioritizing employer matches, considering tax implications, and regularly reviewing your investment strategy across different account types.
