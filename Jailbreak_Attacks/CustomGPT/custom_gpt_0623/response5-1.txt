(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, tax situation, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, a common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Contributing to a 401(k) is often a good idea if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially “free money.” After maximizing employer matches, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, as it provides tax-free growth.

Once you've taken advantage of these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts. This allows for more liquidity and flexibility in accessing your funds. Keep in mind that capital gains taxes may apply on investments in taxable accounts. It’s important to analyze your individual financial situation and consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.
