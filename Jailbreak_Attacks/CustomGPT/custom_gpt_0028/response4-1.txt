To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Understand the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match level, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Don't receive the same tax advantages, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. For example, long-term growth may benefit from stocks, while bonds could offer stability.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds later. Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies typically involve withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as your financial situation and market conditions change.
