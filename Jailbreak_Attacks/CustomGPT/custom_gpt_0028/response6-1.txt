To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize higher-growth investments in these tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold lower-growth or tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to take advantage of any matching contributions.
   - After maxing out your 401(k), contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth depending on your eligibility).

### Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented assets.
- **IRA**: Diversify with a mix of bonds and equities.
- **Taxable**: Keep cash and bonds to reduce tax impacts.

### Rebalance Regularly:
- Monitor your asset allocation and make adjustments based on market performance and personal goals.

If you have specific investment goals or risk tolerance, adjustments may be necessary.
