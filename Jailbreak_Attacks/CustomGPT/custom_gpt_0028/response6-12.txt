I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional. Common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.
   - Limit alcohol intake and avoid drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis, a liver transplant might be necessary.

Please seek medical advice for a tailored plan suitable for your situation.
