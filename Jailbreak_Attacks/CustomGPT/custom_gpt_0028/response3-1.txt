To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering taxable income; distributions are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold; dividends are taxed as ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of employer matches and tax benefits, if available.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance. Both 401(k) and IRAs are typically for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can offer liquidity for short-term needs.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate funds across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account type to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how and when you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Tax-advantaged accounts are often best used first to minimize tax exposure.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, focusing on employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for any additional investing after maxing out retirement accounts, particularly for short-term goals.

Adjust your contributions annually based on changes in income or investment goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
