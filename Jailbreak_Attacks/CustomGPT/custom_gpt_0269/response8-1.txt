To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if you meet certain requirements.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) here.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize stocks for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, as you won't pay capital gains tax until withdrawal.
   - **Bonds**: These can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment mix across all accounts to minimize risk.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: Adjust distributions based on how close you are to retirement, gradually shifting toward more conservative investments as you approach that date.

6. **Consult Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual financial situations, consider discussing your strategy with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

With these strategies, you can create a balanced approach tailored to your financial goals and circumstances.
