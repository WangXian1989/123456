Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution limit if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer a tax deduction upfront.

### 2. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a sufficient cash reserve in a taxable account for immediate access without penalties. Typically, aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Invest in assets that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account type, ensure a diverse mix of assets (stocks, bonds, ETFs) based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust as your life circumstances and market conditions change.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
- Invest wisely across all accounts to manage risks and taxes effectively.
