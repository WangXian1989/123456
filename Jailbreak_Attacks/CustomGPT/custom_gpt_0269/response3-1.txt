To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Considerations
- **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Prioritize maxing out employer matching contributions.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs give tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds that minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- Make sure to stay within annual contribution limits: $22,500 for 401(k)s (2023), $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 if over age 50).

### 3. Emergency Fund
- Maintain an emergency fund with 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid account before aggressive investing.

### 4. Diversification
- Diversify your investments within each account to mitigate risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. Investment Goals
- Align your asset allocation with your retirement timeline. A more aggressive portfolio is suitable when young, gradually shifting to conservative as retirement approaches.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then consider additional contributions up to the limit.
2. **IRA**: Fund a Roth IRA if eligible for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for current tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Account**: Use this for short-term goals and tax-efficient investments.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50% of contributions
- **IRA**: 30% of contributions
- **Taxable Account**: 20% of contributions

### Regular Review
- Reassess your allocation annually based on changes in income, taxes, and financial goals.

### Summary
Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first, then invest in taxable accounts, keeping your overall investment strategy aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
