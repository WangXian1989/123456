Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Tax-Efficient Investing**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts to optimize growth and manage risk.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how withdrawals will impact your tax situationâ€”withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### 6. **Considerations for Life Events**
   - Adapt your strategy based on significant life changes, like marriage, children, or retirement.

### Summary
Create a financial plan that aligns with your long-term goals, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
