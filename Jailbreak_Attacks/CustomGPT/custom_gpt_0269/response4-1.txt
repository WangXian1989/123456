Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Benefits**: Employers often match contributions, and it offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **Strategy**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match before allocating funds elsewhere.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Strategy**: If you're eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, the Traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Benefits**: Flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties and no contribution limits.
   - **Strategy**: Use these accounts for investments that generate capital gains, dividends, and interest, as these may be taxed at lower rates than regular income.

### General Allocation Tips:
- **Short-term Goals**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for quick access.
- **Long-term Goals**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs for retirement savings.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (to max employer match)
- **Roth IRA**: Max contribution ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds for flexibility

### Conclusion
Evaluate your immediate needs and long-term goals, tax implications, and adjust your allocation accordingly. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
