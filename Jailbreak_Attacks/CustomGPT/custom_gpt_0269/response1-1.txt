Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** IRAs have tax advantages; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages; you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Fund Roth IRA (if eligible):** Consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify.
   - **Max Out 401(k):** Next, aim to max out your 401(k) contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts Last:** Use these for additional savings and flexibility once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Age and Goals**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus on growth; consider higher-risk investments in retirement accounts.
   - **Closer to Retirement:** Shift toward lower-risk investments and ensure liquidity in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-efficient Investments:** Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts, balancing risk and return.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on changing goals or market conditions.

### Example Strategy
1. **401(k):** Max out contributions to get the employer match.
2. **IRA:** Contribute to Roth IRA (if eligible) or traditional IRA based on your situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Start contributing after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
