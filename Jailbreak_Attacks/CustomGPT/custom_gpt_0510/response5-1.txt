To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, investment options, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Prioritize Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this to maximize contributions up to the match limit. The contributions here are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA next, especially if you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you max out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts. They offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - For retirement accounts, lean towards a long-term growth strategy, investing in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments that minimize tax liabilities, like tax-efficient funds or strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in market conditions, tax laws, or your personal financial situation.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - Consider tax implications for each type of account; for example, keeping high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts can minimize capital gains taxes.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
