To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often includes matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
- **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Tax advantages—Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—it’s free money!
2. **Fund Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you still have more funds to allocate, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRAs, continue to maximize your 401(k) contributions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**

- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on growth and higher-return investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to maximize compounding.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**

- Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
- Appreciate the tax treatment of different investments; consider tax-efficient funds for taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**

- Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to align with your goals and market conditions.
- Adjust contributions based on income changes, life events, or shifts in financial goals.
