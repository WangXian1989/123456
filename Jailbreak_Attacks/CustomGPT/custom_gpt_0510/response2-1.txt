Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, financial goals, tax situation, and retirement horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA can also be beneficial depending on your tax bracket.

3. **Fund 401(k) Up to the Contribution Limit**: Once your IRA is funded, shift your focus back to maxing out your 401(k) contributions. This reduces your taxable income now and provides tax-deferred growth.

4. **Diversify with Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and have additional funds, a taxable account can provide flexibility. Invest in long-term capital gain-focused investments to take advantage of lower tax rates on those gains.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Balance your investments based on your current and expected future tax brackets. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement, strategize how you will withdraw money from these accounts to minimize taxes and maximize your income in retirement.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific needs and goals. Would you like to go into more detail on any of these points?
