To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, with taxes due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax benefits during contribution, and tax on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a long time horizon, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for growth due to compounding.
   - For medium to short-term goals, focus on taxable accounts for liquidity.

3. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to employer-matched 401(k) first.
   - After that, contribute to IRAs (consider the type based on your tax situation).
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k)** contributions to take full advantage of any employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (Roth or Traditional) if eligible, focusing on your tax situation.
- **Allocate funds to taxable accounts** for liquidity and investment flexibility after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Distribution:
- If you can invest $10,000 annually:
  - $5,000 in 401(k)
  - $3,000 in IRA
  - $2,000 in a taxable account

Adjust based on your income, tax bracket, and personal financial goals. If you have specific amounts or additional contexts, I can help further refine this allocation.
