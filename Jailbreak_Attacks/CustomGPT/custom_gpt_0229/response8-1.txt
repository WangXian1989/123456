Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out contributions if your employer offers a matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - Focus on this account for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Use a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions grow tax-free.
   - A traditional IRA can provide an upfront tax deduction, useful if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - This account is also flexible for withdrawals, making it suitable for shorter-term goals.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **Max out 401(k)** to take advantage of employer matches.
- **Contribute to IRA** (maximize if possible).
- **Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts** for flexibility and to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review and rebalance based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

This balanced approach can help optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
