To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax benefits. Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Brackets**: Keep an eye on your current tax bracket. If you're in a lower bracket, consider Roth conversions or maximizing a Roth IRA.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns (bonds) or for funds you may need in the short term. This helps minimize tax implications.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify investments based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix across all accounts.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement from each account, keeping tax implications in mind.

Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
