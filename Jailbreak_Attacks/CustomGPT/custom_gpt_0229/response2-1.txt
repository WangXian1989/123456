Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Employer 401(k):**
   - **Contribution Match:** Max out contributions to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Debt Management:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maxing out your 401(k).

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide between a Roth IRA (contributions are taxed now, grows tax-free) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes owed upon withdrawal). 
   - **Max Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Access:** Use these for short-term goals or emergency funds since they offer more liquidity.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax liability.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize contributions to retirement accounts** where you receive benefits (like matches or tax deductions).
- Once maxed out, allocate excess funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and investment diversification.
- Regularly review your asset allocation based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors might lean towards growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement might prefer stability.
- **Tax Implications:** Be aware of asset location strategies to minimize taxes.
- **Financial Goals:** Align your investments with your short-term and long-term goals.
