To optimize your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**:
     - Include higher-growth assets (stocks) since taxes on gains are deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Favor tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan withdrawals based on tax brackets in retirement; prioritize tax-deferred accounts first.

By carefully planning contributions and asset placements, you can enhance your overall returns while minimizing tax impacts.
