Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maximizing contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket; contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Aim to maximize IRA contributions if you're close to retirement to take full advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or investments with less favorable tax treatment, such as active trading or high-dividend stocks.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, mixing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
