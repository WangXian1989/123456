I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet and regular exercise.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol can prevent further damage.
4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to assess liver function.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplant may be necessary.

Please seek medical advice for a diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
