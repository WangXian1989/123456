To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider fully funding your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) since it offers tax advantages.

3. **Complete 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is funded, return to your 401(k) to maximize your contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest any additional savings in taxable accounts for more flexible access. Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or if you reach the contribution limits of your retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification & Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and more tax-inefficient options (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing & Tax Planning**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, and consider tax implications when selling investments.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

This approach balances tax efficiency, retirement savings, and investment flexibility.
