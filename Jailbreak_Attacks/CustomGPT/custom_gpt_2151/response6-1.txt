Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Prioritize Based on Tax Treatment**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Best for high-income years; reduce taxable income now, pay taxes during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for flexibility and accessing money before retirement age without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds) for long-term growth without immediate tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor your allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### Summary
By leveraging tax-advantaged accounts first, prioritizing based on tax treatment, diversifying effectively, and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can optimize your investment distribution for maximum long-term benefit.
