Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full employer match**. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if your employer offers a match. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Ideal if you want a tax deduction now. Good for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Great for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose this if you anticipate being in the same or higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversify your investments** among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally:
     - **Long-term (20+ years)**: Higher allocation in stocks.
     - **Mid-term (10-20 years)**: Balanced approach.
     - **Short-term (0-10 years)**: More conservatively invested, possibly in bonds or cash equivalents.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications on Taxable Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when buying/selling investments. 
   - Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that minimize taxable events.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your allocations annually, especially as your financial situation, tax laws, or goals change.

### General Distribution Strategy Example:
1. **401(k)**: Maximize to employer match + additional contributions (if possible).
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable (consider Roth for tax-free growth).
3. **Taxable Account**: Use for additional savings or investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Customizing this strategy to fit your personal circumstances is crucial. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific goals and situation.
