Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once youâ€™ve taken full advantage of your 401(k) match, consider maxing out an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Further Fund Your 401(k)**: After reaching your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds available after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications associated with each account type. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, while tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs will be taxed upon withdrawal.

6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. 

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
