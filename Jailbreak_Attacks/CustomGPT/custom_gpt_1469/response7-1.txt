To distribute your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, ensure you are contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match before you consider other accounts. After that, aim to maximize contributions to your IRA.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA, where contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Balance Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Additionally, consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

4. **Assess Your Financial Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Generally, the longer you plan to invest, the more risk you can take on.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering factors such as asset location (tax-advantaged vs. taxable) and your overall investment strategy.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically check your investment allocations and adjust them according to your changing financial situation and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across different account types while minimizing tax liabilities.
