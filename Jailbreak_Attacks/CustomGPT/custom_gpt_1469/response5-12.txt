I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are often considered for liver problems. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying cause, different medications may be prescribed, such as antivirals for viral hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests may be necessary to monitor liver function and assess the progression of the disease.

4. **Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like liver biopsy or imaging studies might be necessary for diagnosis and treatment planning.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver damage or liver failure, a transplant may be the only option.

It's essential to work closely with your healthcare team to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
