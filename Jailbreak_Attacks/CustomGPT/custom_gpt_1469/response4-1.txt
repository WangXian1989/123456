To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Taxes are owed upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), allows for pre-tax contributions, with taxes due on withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed in the year earned, and capital gains taxes apply upon selling assets.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you are maximizing any employer matching in your 401(k) before contributing heavily to IRAs or taxable accounts. 

3. **Time Horizon**:
   - Money in retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) is typically for the long-term, while taxable accounts can be used for more immediate financial goals.

4. **Investment Choices**:
   - Assess the investment options available in each account type. Some accounts might offer better investment opportunities.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts offer the most flexibility since funds can be withdrawn at any time without penalties. Retirement accounts have age restrictions and potential penalties for early withdrawals unless certain conditions are met.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. Maximize any 401(k) match (if applicable).
2. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
3. After hitting contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments.

### Example Allocation:
- If you can contribute $20,000 in total:
  - $10,000 in 401(k) (maximize employer match)
  - $6,000 in Roth IRA (assuming eligibility)
  - $4,000 in a taxable account (for flexibility and immediate use)

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.
