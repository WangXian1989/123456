It's great that you're thinking about distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. However, please remember that my responses do not constitute financial advice, and consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance is always recommended. 

That said, here are some general strategies to consider for allocating your funds:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - After that, consider balancing contributions based on tax advantages.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize funding your IRA (Roth or Traditional) after maxing out your 401(k) match. IRAs often have more investment options and tax flexibility.
   - Use your taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement or for investments that might generate capital gains.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Fund accounts based on your current and expected future tax situation. For example, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, it might be preferable to contribute to a Roth IRA.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while placing higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts. 

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, market conditions, and your financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this general advice to your specific circumstances.
