Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund an IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you're not maxing out your 401(k) contributions, aim to do so, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. This is useful for shorter-term goals or emergencies.

### 5. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Ensure diversification across all accounts. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and investment strategies based on your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing life circumstances, market conditions, and your investment strategy.

### Summary
Start by maximizing any employer retirement match, then fund an IRA, prioritize maximizing your 401(k), and use taxable accounts for additional investments. Tailor your choices based on your unique financial situation and goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
