Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA and 401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement (including earnings) are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - After taking full advantage of the employer match, consider the following order:
     - **Max out Roth IRA** (if eligible): Tax-free growth and withdrawals.
     - **Contribute more to 401(k)**: Especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - If you're maxed out, then consider **taxable accounts**.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Keep **higher-growth investments** (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Place **income-generating investments** (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax on interest.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Retirement Timeline**
   - For those closer to retirement, prioritize stability and income (lower-risk investments).
   - For younger investors, focus on growth-oriented investments for long-term accumulation.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Assess your portfolio at least annually to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among these accounts effectively.
