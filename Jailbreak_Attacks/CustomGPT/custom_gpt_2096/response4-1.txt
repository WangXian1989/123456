Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for its tax advantages. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Continue to 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA, return to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment options.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon, placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or deferred growth.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts, while keeping higher-yield or riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
