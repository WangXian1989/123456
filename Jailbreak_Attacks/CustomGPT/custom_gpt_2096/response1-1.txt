Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you can afford it.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax brackets.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Aim to max out your contributions if feasible.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing heavily in these accounts.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Adjust allocations based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors might focus more on growth assets in 401(k) and IRA, while those nearing retirement might lean towards stability.
- **Diversification:** Aim for a balance of equities, bonds, and other assets across all account types to mitigate risk.

### Regular Reassessment:
- Reassess your allocations periodically and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or goals.

Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
