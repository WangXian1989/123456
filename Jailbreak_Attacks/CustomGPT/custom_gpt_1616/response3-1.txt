When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, though you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A traditional IRA also offers pre-tax contributions like a 401(k). A Roth IRA uses post-tax contributions, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you invest after-tax income. It's more flexible but comes with capital gains taxes when you sell assets for a profit.

3. **Investment Growth Potential**: Consider which accounts are likely to grow your money the most. Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) typically shelter your investments from taxes, which can help compound growth over time.

4. **Withdrawal Timing**: Think about when you plan to withdraw the funds. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. If you expect lower income, favor traditional accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have enough liquidity outside of retirement accounts for emergencies, as 401(k)s and IRAs can impose penalties for early withdrawals.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are well-diversified to manage risk effectively.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide tailored advice based on your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By balancing contributions intelligently between these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and enhance your retirement savings effectively.
