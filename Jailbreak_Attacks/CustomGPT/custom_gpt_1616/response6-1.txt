To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. If your employer matches contributions, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Leverage Roth Accounts:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Investment Objectives:**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts meant for long-term growth (like your 401(k) and IRA) while keeping more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage current tax liabilities.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Place high-growth assets in tax-deferred accounts and income-producing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize the tax impact.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to maintain overall portfolio balance and risk management.

4. **Regular Review:**
   - Reassess and rebalance your allocation periodically to align with changing financial goals and market conditions.
