Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before investing heavily.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if possible, as this reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better for you based on your current and expected future tax rates.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals, but keep an eye on taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diverse asset allocation across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your time horizons—higher risk for long-term growth in retirement accounts, and more conservative options in taxable accounts if you expect to need those funds sooner.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
