Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider maxing out contributions (the limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement or for income-generating investments, as you can control the timing of capital gains and tax liabilities.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified. This can include a mixture of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:** Over time, ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and goals. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired investment strategy.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Typically, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts to optimize your tax efficiency.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal financial situation.
