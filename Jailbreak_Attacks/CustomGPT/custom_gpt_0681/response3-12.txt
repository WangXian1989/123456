1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver stress.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular follow-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function tests and overall health.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Control conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, and fatty liver disease through appropriate medications and lifestyle modifications.

5. **Procedures**: In some cases, procedures such as liver biopsies or surgeries may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific situation.
