Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you're still able to contribute more after the IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This reduces your taxable income now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This will give you flexibility for shorter-term goals and can be beneficial for capital gains tax treatment.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts. 

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your investment strategy as your financial situation, goals, and tax laws change.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies based on your specific circumstances.
