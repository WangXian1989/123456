To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax. However, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**: Assess your investment timeline and risk tolerance. Longer timelines might benefit from more aggressive growth strategies, while shorter timelines may necessitate more conservative investments.

3. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the maximum match, as this is essentially "free money."

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older for 2023).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older for 2023).

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. 

**Suggested Strategy**:
1. Max out any employer match in your 401(k).
2. Depending on your tax situation, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
3. After maxing out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts as needed for more liquidity or specific goals.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation may change, so review your allocations and strategies regularly, adjusting them based on performance and life changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
