The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized, making this the least tax-advantaged option.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating to these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses.

4. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: 
   - Understand the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, 401(k) contributions are capped at $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older), and IRAs at $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50+).

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement, consider shifting more funds to conservative investments to protect your savings.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help create a plan tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.

It's crucial to reevaluate your distribution regularly based on changes in income, expenses, goals, and market conditions.
