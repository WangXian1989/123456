Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging (like ultrasounds) to monitor liver function.

4. **Weight Management**: For fatty liver disease, weight loss can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
