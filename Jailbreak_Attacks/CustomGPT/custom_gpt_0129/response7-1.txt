To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Taxes**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (lowering current taxable income), but withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s regarding taxes, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which are usually lower than ordinary income rates.

3. **Investment Growth**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) or for short-term goals.

4. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As retirement approaches, consider a withdrawal strategy that minimizes your tax liability.

### Example Allocation:
- **First**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.
- **Second**: Max out your IRA contributions.
- **Third**: Allocate any additional funds to your 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your tax situation.
