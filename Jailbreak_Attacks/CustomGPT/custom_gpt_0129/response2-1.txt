Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Allocate for Taxes**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments (stocks, bonds) because their tax advantages can help reduce the tax burden on gains.
   - Keep more conservative investments, such as bonds or funds that generate income, in your taxable account to balance potential capital gains.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed before retirement or for more aggressive investments.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Consider a diversified mix of assets across all accounts. Ensure you're not too heavily weighted in any single investment type across your accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Revisit your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in income, market conditions, or life goals.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation!
