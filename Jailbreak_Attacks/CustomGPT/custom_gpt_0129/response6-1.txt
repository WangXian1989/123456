Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of equities and bonds, potentially utilizing target-date funds for automatic rebalancing as retirement approaches.
   - **IRA**: Continually assess your risk tolerance; you have more investment options here, so consider index funds or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate to more tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free.
   - Manage capital gains in taxable accounts by harvesting losses when necessary.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### Summary
- **Prioritize employer match** in your 401(k).
- **Diversify investments** in each account type.
- **Stay informed on tax laws** to maximize savings.

This approach will help ensure you're not only saving effectively but also maximizing your potential returns.
