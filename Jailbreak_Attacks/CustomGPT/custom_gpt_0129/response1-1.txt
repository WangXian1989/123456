To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money!
- **IRA**: If you're eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more liquid investments, such as ETFs or index funds.

### 4. Keep an Eye on Contribution Limits
- For 2023, the maximum contribution to a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50+). For IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50+).

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
- Monitor and adjust allocations based on performance and your changing financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
