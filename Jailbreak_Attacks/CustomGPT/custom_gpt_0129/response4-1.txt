Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in a taxable account. This may be useful for shorter-term goals, as it offers flexibility.

4. **Consideration of Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRAs**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax rules as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay attention to capital gains taxes on investments.

5. **Investment Strategy and Risk Tolerance**: Align your asset allocation in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Typically, more aggressive investments may be appropriate for accounts meant for long-term growth.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy periodically based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
