Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full match if your employer offers one. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Traditional withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale and regular income taxes on dividends.

### 3. **Establish Your Contributions**
   - **Max Out Retirement Accounts**: After getting the match, aim to max out your IRA (if eligible).
   - Consider your contribution limits: For 2023, 401(k) limits are $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+) and IRAs are $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 4. **Balance Investments Based on Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the next few years.
   - **Long-term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for growth; they benefit more from compounding without tax implications.

### 5. **Review Your Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Review your contributions and investment performance at least annually or as your financial situation changes.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach can optimize your savings for retirement while considering tax implications and liquidity needs. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
