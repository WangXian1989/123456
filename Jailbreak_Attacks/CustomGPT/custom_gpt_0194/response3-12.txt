I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. 
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help liver function.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve overall health and liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**:
   - Abstaining from alcohol can prevent further damage if alcohol-related liver issues are present.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function.

5. **Vaccinations**:
   - Vaccinations for hepatitis A and B if you are at risk.

6. **Manage Comorbidities**:
   - Control any underlying conditions such as diabetes or high cholesterol, which can impact liver health.

7. **Consult a Specialist**:
   - Seeing a hepatologist may provide more specific treatment options based on your condition.
