Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Use this for retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. If you're eligible for a Roth, it might be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for short- to medium-term goals.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Focus:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, since they offer tax advantages.
   - **Short-term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need sooner.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **Maximize employer match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
   - **IRA Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. More aggressive portfolios might be suitable in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure diversification across all accounts for risk management.

### 5. **Long-term Strategy**
   - Ideally, prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth and taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Example Strategy
- **Max out 401(k)** up to the match.
- **Contribute to IRA** (Roth if eligible).
- Any remaining funds can go into a **taxable account**.

### Conclusion
Review your overall financial plan regularly, considering changes in income, expenses, and life goals.
