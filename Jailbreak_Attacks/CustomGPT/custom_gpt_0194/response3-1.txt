Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income year, contribute to your 401(k) to lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider funding a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. These can be useful for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks).
   - Hold more stable investments (e.g., bonds, dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or tax law changes.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of capital gains and income tax implications in taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
