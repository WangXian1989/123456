To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Max out employer match on your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve taken advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Focus on tax-efficient investments here, like index funds.

4. **Diversify your investments**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts to optimize growth.

5. **Withdrawals and taxes**: Plan your withdrawals with tax implications in mind, generally targeting taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Rebalance annually**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific financial situation.
