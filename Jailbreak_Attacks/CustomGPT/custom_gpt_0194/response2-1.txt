Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize growth and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (after-tax contributions) over Traditional IRAs (pre-tax).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access early, as they offer more flexibility and may be taxed at lower rates on long-term capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

6. ** Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your situation.
