To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax advantages depending on the type; Roth earnings grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals; capital gains tax applies.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Prioritize maxing out contributions for tax benefits (especially Roth for future tax-free withdrawals).

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, tax-managed funds).
   - Allocate higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential and defer taxes.

### 4. **Consider Your Financial Goals**
   - For short-term needs, favor taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - For long-term growth, prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations based on changing market conditions and your individual goals.
