I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information. Treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, some medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be considered.

Consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice specific to your situation.
