Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts ideally involves considering factors like tax implications, contribution limits, investment goals, and your current financial situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available.

2. **Fill Your IRA**: Next, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

3. **401(k) Contribution**: After the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts for short-term needs or additional growth, as they offer flexibility.

### Key Considerations:

- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keep tax-efficient ones (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when you plan to withdraw funds in retirement, as different accounts have different tax implications.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within each account align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Regular Review:
Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in income, expenses, or tax laws.
