I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general options that are commonly considered for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some treatment options that might be discussed:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. Avoid saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may help manage symptoms or improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging can help track liver health and adjust treatments as needed.

4. **Avoid Alcohol and Toxins**:
   - Refraining from alcohol and minimizing exposure to harmful chemicals helps reduce liver strain.

Always consult a healthcare provider for diagnosis and tailored treatment options.
