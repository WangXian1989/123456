When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Your Tax Situation:** 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are made pre-tax, which means you will pay taxes when you withdraw during retirement. In contrast, Roth IRAs and taxable accounts may have different tax implications.

2. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $19,500 ($26,000 if age 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,000 ($7,000 if age 50 or older)
   - Taxable accounts: No limits.

4. **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to balance risk and reward. This can include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

5. **Investment Goals:** Align your investments with your retirement goals. For long-term goals, consider a more aggressive portfolio in tax-advantaged accounts, while opting for more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. You'll typically want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Consult a Professional:** It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your individual circumstances.

By considering these factors, you can effectively distribute your money across your financial accounts to work towards your retirement goals.
