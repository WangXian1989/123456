When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), focus on contributing enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level and tax filing status, you may be eligible for a traditional IRA (which offers tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type:
   - For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older) for 2023.

4. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Consider your future tax situation. Having money in both pre-tax (401(k), traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility in retirement. This strategy allows you to manage your taxable income during retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Non-Retirement Goals**: If you have additional savings goals outside of retirement, you can use taxable accounts. These accounts offer greater liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If you're young and have a long time until retirement, you might focus more on aggressive growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA. Conversely, if retirement is approaching, you may want to shift toward a more conservative investment strategy.

7. **Monitor and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions. Make adjustments as your financial situation changes (e.g., salary increases, changes in expenses) or as you approach retirement.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Because individual circumstances vary widely, consider meeting with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy best suited to your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

Always remember that your financial goals and situation are unique, so it's vital to create a strategy that aligns with your personal needs.
