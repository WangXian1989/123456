When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies for optimizing your investment based on financial goals, tax implications, and retirement planning:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Income-Producing Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding dividend-paying stocks or bonds in taxable accounts, since youâ€™ll pay taxes on these anyway.

3. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This will help manage risk and ensure a balanced approach.

4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding where to place your investments. Tax-efficient fund options can be especially beneficial for taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how and when you will draw down these accounts in retirement to optimize tax efficiency and minimize penalties.

By assessing your individual situation, goals, and tax implications, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial objectives. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
