I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. They might recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or specific treatments depending on your liver condition. Common options can include a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and possibly medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes. Please seek professional medical assistance for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
