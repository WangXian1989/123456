The optimal way to distribute your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Debt Management**
   - Pay off high-interest debt before heavily investing. Itâ€™s crucial to prioritize financial security while contributing to retirement accounts.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best used for investments that generate capital gains, which might be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, such as stocks or mutual funds held long-term.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These are great for income-generating investments, like bonds, since you'll defer taxes until withdrawal, typically at retirement when you might be in a lower tax bracket.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon within each account. Younger individuals may prefer higher-risk investments (stocks) for long-term growth.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Your financial situation and goals may change, necessitating a reevaluation of your distribution strategy. Conduct regular reviews.

### Conclusion
Balancing your contributions between these accounts strategically can maximize your growth potential and minimize taxes. Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific needs and goals.
