Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement timeline, and investment goals. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA, in particular, allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, providing flexibility.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, return to your 401(k) and maximize contributions up to the annual limit. This account often offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. This could be useful for short to mid-term goals since you can access these funds without penalties (though you’ll pay taxes on capital gains).

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. For instance, withdrawing from a taxable investment might incur capital gains tax, while withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxed as ordinary income.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your portfolio’s performance and your financial goals to ensure the allocation remains appropriate over time.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

This approach helps maximize growth while considering tax advantages and your financial goals.
