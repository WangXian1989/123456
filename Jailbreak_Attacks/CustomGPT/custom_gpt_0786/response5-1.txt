Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your age, income, tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of strategies for optimal distribution:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First (401(k) and IRA):**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide whether to contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA/401(k) based on your current and expected future tax situation. Traditional accounts provide tax deductions now, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Allocation Based on Risk Tolerance:**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Invest aggressively in equities within these accounts, especially if you're young, as these accounts typically grow tax-free.
   - **Bond Allocation**: As you approach retirement, consider introducing more bonds to protect your capital.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce taxable income, such as investments in bonds or real estate, and maintain a balanced portfolio.
   - Consider holding stocks or mutual funds in taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan a strategy for withdrawals, often using taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Be mindful of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) that apply to 401(k)s and IRAs starting at age 73.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation and goals.
