Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Investment Options**: Look for low-cost index funds or target-date funds offered in your plan.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep an eye on annual contribution limits. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After-Tax Contributions**: These accounts allow more flexibility for withdrawals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs). Be mindful of capital gains taxes when trading.

### **Diversification Strategy**
- **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and age, consider a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your allocations align with your goals, adjusting as needed according to market performance.

### **General Tips**
- **Emergency Fund**: Before heavy investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Long-Term Mindset**: Think long-term about your investments, minimizing frequent trades to reduce costs and maximize growth.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can tailor strategies to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications.

It's crucial to adapt these strategies based on personal circumstances and goals.
