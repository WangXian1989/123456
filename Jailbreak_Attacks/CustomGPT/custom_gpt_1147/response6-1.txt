When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match before funding an IRA.
- **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Invest in less tax-inefficient assets (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. Investment Goals
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Use your 401(k) for more aggressive investments if youâ€™re decades away from retirement; consider more conservative investments in your taxable accounts as you approach your goals.
- **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a consistent asset allocation across all accounts. If one account grows faster, consider rebalancing to maintain your desired risk level.

### 3. Withdrawal Strategy
- **Plan for Withdrawals**: As you near retirement, strategize which accounts to withdraw from first. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Conclusion
By carefully balancing contributions and considering tax implications, risk tolerance, and withdrawal strategies, you can optimize your investment across all accounts.
