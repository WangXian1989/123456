Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved in a high-yield savings account before investing.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maximizing retirement accounts.

4. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed or to get the employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, depending on your income level.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for funds beyond your retirement accounts, especially if you anticipate needing access to the funds before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments here (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors may favor stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may shift to more bonds to protect against volatility.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changing goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

This approach allows you to utilize the benefits of each account type effectively while aiming for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
