Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if there's a match. This account grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may offer upfront tax advantages, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. Use these accounts for more flexible investing opportunities since they don't have the same contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) that minimize taxable events.
   - For bonds or other interest-generating assets, consider keeping them in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or reduce tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio allocation across these accounts and rebalance as needed to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Every situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

This strategy can help you take full advantage of tax benefits while ensuring you have a diversified investment portfolio.
