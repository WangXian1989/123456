Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for maximizing your investment growth and minimizing taxes. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers higher contribution limits and may include employer matching. Funds grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Provides tax advantages for retirement savings, with lower contribution limits compared to 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offers flexibility but is subject to capital gains taxes and interest income tax.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Additional 401(k) or Taxable Accounts**: Once the IRA is fully funded, continue with your 401(k) contributions, then allocate any extra funds to a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on diversified options and consider target-date funds if you're unsure about asset allocation.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), but you can tailor your investments more since there are typically more choices.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Withdrawals**: Plan for tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts in retirement. Generally, 401(k) and IRA distributions are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates.
   - **Loss Harvesting**: Use taxable accounts to offset gains with losses if strategically planned.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Review your allocations periodically, especially as your income and retirement goals change, and adjust contributions as necessary.

This strategy can help you build a robust and tax-efficient portfolio over time. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your specific situation.
