Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out an IRA (whether traditional or Roth), focusing on your long-term savings and tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or investments that might generate taxable capital gains or dividends. This can give you flexibility if you need access to funds before retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, you might invest more aggressively, as the growth is tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Short-term goals might be better served with taxable accounts.
   - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions, especially if you have a long time until retirement.

5. **Adjust as Needed**:
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, or tax law changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice that factors in your unique financial situation and goals, consider speaking with a financial planner.

This balanced approach can help ensure you maximize your savings while minimizing taxes on your investments.
