Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) reduce your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - Taxable accounts can be more flexible for withdrawals and investments that might generate lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Each account type might have different investment opportunities or tax implications.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and higher growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Liquid Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your short-term liquidity needs. Taxable accounts can provide quicker access to funds compared to retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Long-Term Growth vs. Short-Term Needs**:
   - Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth, as they offer tax benefits that can significantly increase your savings over time.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions, adjusting as your financial situation and goals evolve.
