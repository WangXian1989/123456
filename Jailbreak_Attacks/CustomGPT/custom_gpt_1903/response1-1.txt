Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 401(k):
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Max Contribution**: Aim to max out contributions if your budget allows. In 2024, the limit is $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older.

### IRA (Traditional or Roth):
- **Tax Benefits**: Choose a Traditional IRA for current tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2024.
- **Diversification**: Consider using your IRA for different asset classes that may be tax-advantaged.

### Taxable Accounts:
- **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for funds you might need before retirement, as they donâ€™t have early withdrawal penalties.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Income Consideration**: Since any earnings will be taxed as income, be mindful of your asset allocation here.

### General Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund before allocating to investments.
2. **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance and allocate funds accordingly. Younger individuals might focus more on growth in retirement accounts while older investors may shift towards preserving capital.
3. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Final Thoughts:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to customize a strategy that fits your unique circumstances and objectives. They can provide insights tailored to your specific financial situation, including tax implications and retirement goals.
