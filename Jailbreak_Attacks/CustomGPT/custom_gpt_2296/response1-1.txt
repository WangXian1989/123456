Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit since it is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're age 50 or older) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution).

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Generally, itâ€™s wise to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts, as these accounts offer tax benefits either through tax-deductible contributions or tax-free growth.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you are in a higher tax bracket now, prioritizing pre-tax contributions to a 401(k) may be beneficial. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth IRA contributions (post-tax) may be more advantageous.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about how to best allocate your funds, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.

Ultimately, your distribution strategy should reflect your individual financial goals, investment preferences, and risk tolerance.
