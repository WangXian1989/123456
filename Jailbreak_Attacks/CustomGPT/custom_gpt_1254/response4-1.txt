Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Investment Options**: Check the fees and options available in your plan.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and funds grow tax-deferred. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Ideal for short-term goals or if you want access to funds without penalty.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be aware of the tax implications when selling investments, especially if held for less than a year.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize contributions** to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- **Maximize IRA contributions** next, balancing between a Traditional and Roth based on your tax strategy.
- **Allocate additional funds** to a taxable account for greater flexibility or short-term needs.

### Final Tip:
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal situation and goals.
