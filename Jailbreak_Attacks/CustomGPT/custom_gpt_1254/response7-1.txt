Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and outlook for retirement. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Contribute to 401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA**: After taking full advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions, direct additional savings towards your 401(k). Increasing your contributions here can also help reduce your taxable income.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement or to invest in assets that don’t fit well within retirement accounts (e.g., real estate, certain stocks). However, this should generally be the last priority unless you’ve reached maximum contributions in your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification and Risk**: Ensure you're maintaining a diversified portfolio across all accounts, taking into account the different tax implications and withdrawal rules.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation may change; re-evaluate your allocation regularly to align with your changing goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
