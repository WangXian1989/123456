Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantage**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) first. Contributing to these can reduce your taxable income now, or your withdrawals in retirement may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Consider Roth Accounts**: If you expect your income to rise, consider using a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Contributions are made after-tax, and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a more accessible (taxable) account before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This means considering different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to balance risk.

6. **Reassessment**: Regularly review and adjust your investments as you get closer to retirement or as your financial situation changes.

7. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
