Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it's essentially "free money." After reaching the match, consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for money you might need access to before retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts, but keep in mind the tax efficiency of different asset classes. For example, hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Check your asset allocation periodically and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

5. **Plan for Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think ahead to how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Balancing withdrawals from taxable accounts, tax-deferred accounts, and tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) can help optimize your tax situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be beneficial to work with a financial professional who can tailor a strategy based on your unique situation.

By using these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy tailored to your retirement needs.
