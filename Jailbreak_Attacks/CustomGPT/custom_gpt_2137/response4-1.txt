Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Employer-Sponsored Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as this is essentially "free money." Consider contributing the maximum if your financial situation allows.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement as long as certain conditions are met. Depending on your current tax bracket and expectations for retirement, you may prefer to contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility. You'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, so consider tax-efficient investment strategies.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, aim for a diversified investment portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider mixing equities, bonds, and other assets to balance growth and stability.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you are closer to retirement, a more conservative allocation might be wise. If you're younger, you might opt for a more aggressive growth strategy, particularly in your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust asset allocation based on changing financial goals, market conditions, or life circumstances.

6. **Seek Professional Guidance**: Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan that fits your specific needs and provides insights based on current regulations and investment trends.

Remember that individual circumstances vary greatly, so consider these factors carefully to build a strategy that works best for you.
