Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several personal factors, including your age, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributing enough to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Options:** Review the investment options available in your 401(k) and choose those that align with your risk tolerance and timeline.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions). A traditional IRA may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, while a Roth IRA could be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits for IRAs, which are generally lower than for 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Contributions to taxable accounts provide the flexibility of access at any time without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations:** Be aware that investments in taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains tax upon sale, so consider holding onto investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Utilize your taxable account for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### General Strategy
- **Diversify:** Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and geographical locations.
- **Rebalance:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consider Financial Goals:** Tailor your distribution based on your short-term and long-term financial goals, such as buying a home, saving for education, or retirement.

### Example Approach
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Max out contributions to a Roth IRA if you qualify, for tax-free growth.
3. Allocate any additional savings to your taxable account, focusing on investments that align with your overall financial strategy.
