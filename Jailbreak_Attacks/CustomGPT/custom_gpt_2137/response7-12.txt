I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment. Generally, treatment for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy weight, following a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can greatly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests may be needed to monitor the condition effectively.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or viral infections may require management to relieve stress on the liver.

5. **Supplementation**: Some healthcare providers recommend specific vitamins or supplements that support liver health.

6. **Surgery or Procedures**: In advanced cases, surgical options such as liver transplant may be warranted. 

Remember, your best course of action is to see a physician who can tailor a treatment plan based on your specific needs.
