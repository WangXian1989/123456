Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
    - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
    - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The choice between these often depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate during retirement.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
    - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and the limit for IRA contributions is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
    - Tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) grow tax-deferred or tax-free (for Roth accounts), while taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.
    - Consider your current and projected future income tax levels when deciding where to allocate funds.

4. **Diversification**:
    - Diversify your investments within these accounts based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Maintain a balanced portfolio aligning with your retirement timeline.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
    - Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in tax-advantaged accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
    - Regularly review your allocations across these accounts as your financial situation changes and as you approach retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
    - If you’re unsure or if your situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your goals.

Remember, the ideal distribution can vary based on individual circumstances, so it’s crucial to evaluate your financial goals and needs periodically.
