The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). This can provide you with tax benefits either now or in retirement.

2. **Diversification of Contributions**:
   - Distribute your contributions based on your anticipated need for funds and tax considerations. For example, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth accounts. If you think you'll be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

3. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment options in your 401(k) plan compared to your IRA and taxable accounts. If your 401(k) has higher fees or limited investment choices, prioritize funding your IRA or taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the tax impacts of each account type. Withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes when assets are sold.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies for Retirement**:
   - Consider how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Planning a strategy that takes tax implications into account can help maximize your net income.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient funds in easily accessible accounts for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in life stages, market conditions, and financial goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your specific situation and goals. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial picture.
