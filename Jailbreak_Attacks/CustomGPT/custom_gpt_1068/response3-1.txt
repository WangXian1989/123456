Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, with withdrawals taxed in retirement, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but you have flexibility in withdrawals and may benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you might choose a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - Any additional savings can go into your taxable account, which offers more liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider risk tolerance and investment goals when allocating funds within these accounts. Typically, you might want to place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Tax Planning**:
   - Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets. This can help guide whether to prioritize tax-deductible contributions (like a Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (like a Roth IRA).

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your account balances and asset allocation to ensure they align with your financial goals and to adjust as your circumstances change.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
