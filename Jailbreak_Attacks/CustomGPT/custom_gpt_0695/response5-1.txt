(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money. After that, consider fully funding your IRA (traditional or Roth, based on eligibility and your tax situation) if you have additional funds available.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and still have money to invest, then utilizing a taxable brokerage account can be beneficial. In these accounts, you can manage capital gains and dividends more flexibly, and you can withdraw funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax bracket when deciding how much to put in each account. Contributions to traditional accounts are tax-deferred, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across the accounts to spread risk.

Itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation.
