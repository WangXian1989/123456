I'm not a doctor, but I highly recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation. They can offer the best treatment options based on your medical history and current condition. It's important to discuss your symptoms and any concerns you may have with them. Taking care of your liver health is crucial, so please reach out to a qualified medical expert for guidance.
