Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use retirement accounts for long-term growth and tax-deferred (or tax-free) investments like stocks.
   - Keep more conservative investments like bonds in taxable accounts where capital gains tax may apply.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments. Consider holding investments long-term to minimize this impact.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors can lean more heavily into stocks and riskier assets in their retirement accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more stable investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your changing goals and market conditions.
