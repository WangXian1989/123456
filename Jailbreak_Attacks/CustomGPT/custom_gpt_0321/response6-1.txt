To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA first. This reduces taxable income and allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Emergency Fund in Taxable Accounts**: Keep liquid funds for immediate needs in taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in 401(k) and IRA for potential growth.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account to minimize risk.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure youâ€™re aware of annual contribution limits for each account to maximize benefits.

By strategically utilizing each account's strengths, you can enhance your overall investment growth while managing tax implications.
