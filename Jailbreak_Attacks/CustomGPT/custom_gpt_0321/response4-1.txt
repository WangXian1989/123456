Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize maxing this out, especially if you have a high tax rate. Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify. Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Here, you have more flexibility with withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolios periodically and adjust contributions and investments based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
