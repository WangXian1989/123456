Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match (up to $22,500 for 2023 or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, with a limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA)**:
     - Contribute to these first to take advantage of tax deferral (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).
   - **Taxable accounts**:
     - Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as you’ll incur taxes annually on those.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Choose diverse funds with a blend of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **IRA**: Similar approach, potentially with more investment options than your 401(k).
   - **Taxable accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for the order of withdrawals in retirement:
     - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
     - Consider future tax implications of withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Monitor and adjust allocations based on market performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

By following this approach, you can effectively build long-term wealth while managing tax implications.
