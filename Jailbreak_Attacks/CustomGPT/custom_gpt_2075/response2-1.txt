To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits depending on whether it's a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals, contributions with after-tax income).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Ideal for short-term savings or goals.

### 2. **Set Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Longer-term goals can be riskier, while shorter-term needs may require more conservative investments.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 4. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After the match, consider prioritizing IRA contributions (especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA) due to their tax advantages.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account. Mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets should reflect your overall risk tolerance.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations within and across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### 7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions next.
3. **Taxable Account**: Use any additional savings here for flexibility and access.

### Conclusion:
Customize your strategy based on personal financial goals, expected retirement timeline, and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan to your specific situation.
