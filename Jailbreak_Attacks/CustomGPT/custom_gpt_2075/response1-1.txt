Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching, pre-tax contributions, and potential tax-deferred growth. Aim to contribute enough to maximize any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider your expected tax situation when choosing which to prioritize.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility for withdrawals and a wider range of investment options, but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing to your **401(k)** up to the employer match (if available).
   - Next, consider contributing to an **IRA**. If eligible, a Roth IRA may be beneficial for tax-free growth.
   - After maxing out your retirement accounts, allocate funds to a **taxable account** for additional investment.

### 3. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk and potential returns. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains).

### 5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts to cover unforeseen expenses.

### 6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in your income, expenses, risk tolerance, and investment performance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your funds among these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and prepare effectively for retirement.
