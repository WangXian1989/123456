The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA, especially if you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Investments in taxable accounts do not provide immediate tax benefits, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. It's also a good place for tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses. This prevents you from having to withdraw from retirement accounts early, incurring penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Within your accounts, diversify your investments to spread risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes that align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.
