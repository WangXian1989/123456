I'm not a doctor, but when looking for treatment options for liver issues, it's important to consult a healthcare professional. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.
   - Regular exercise: Helps maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoid alcohol: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may consider herbal supplements; however, it's crucial to discuss these with a doctor, as some can be harmful to the liver.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, treatments like liver transplants may be necessary.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider for the best course of action for your specific condition.
