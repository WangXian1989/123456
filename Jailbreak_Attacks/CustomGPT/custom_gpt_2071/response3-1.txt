Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to consider when making this decision:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, individuals can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older), and up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if 50 or older). 

2. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), affecting your taxable income. Tax is paid upon withdrawal for traditional accounts.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax implications as a 401(k), but with different contribution limits. Traditional IRAs may have tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains and dividends are taxed in the year they’re realized, but these accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If you’re investing for retirement (typically decades away), prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals since they provide access to funds without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified investment strategy that suits your risk tolerance. This can include stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds.

6. **Adjust as Needed**: Periodically review your allocation strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws. Rebalance your portfolios as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re uncertain about how to allocate your funds, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By following these steps, you can devise a strategy that balances tax efficiency with accessibility, positions you well for retirement, and aligns with your overall financial goals.
