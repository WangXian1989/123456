(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A common approach is to maximize employer contributions to your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money." Next, contributing to an IRA could be beneficial, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as it provides tax-free growth. After that, you can allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts. It's also essential to consider the investment options available in each account and any fees associated with them.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down like this: maximize that 401(k) first, especially if your employer matches contributionsâ€”don't leave that free money on the table! Then, if you can swing it, funnel some cash into an IRA; a Roth is pretty sweet for tax-free growth if you're into that. Finally, throw some extra bucks into your taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. Just remember to balance your investments based on how much risk you're willing to take and keep an eye on those pesky taxes. Do what feels right for your financial vibe, but also donâ€™t sleep on diversifying your sweet stash!
