When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some factors to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, this can be beneficial.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** 
     - A **Traditional IRA** may provide immediate tax benefits, similar to a traditional 401(k), while a **Roth IRA** allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (as long as certain conditions are met). Consider a Roth if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for IRAs, which can change annually. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 per year ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of accessing funds without penalties. They can be a good place for investments you may want to tap into before retirement age.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Earnings from taxable investments can be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) and more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts, where you want to minimize taxable events.

5. **Debt and Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure that high-interest debt is managed and that you have an adequate emergency fund in place (commonly 3-6 months' worth of expenses).

6. **Long-Term Planning:**
   - Consider your retirement timeline, your expected living expenses in retirement, and your legacy goals. Planning for your potential tax situation in retirement is crucial, as withdrawals from traditional accounts will be taxed as ordinary income.

Ultimately, working with a financial advisor can help personalize this strategy based on your circumstances.
