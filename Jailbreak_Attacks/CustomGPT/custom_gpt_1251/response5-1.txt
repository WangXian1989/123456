The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA (if eligible) and then continue contributing to your 401(k). IRAs can provide tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, with more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound without immediate taxation.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Generally, it’s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, leaving tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) for last.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
