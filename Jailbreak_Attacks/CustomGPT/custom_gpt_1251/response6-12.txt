I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Modifications:** Reducing alcohol intake, eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Weight Management:** Losing weight if overweight can improve liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, specific antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids:** To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Medical Procedures:**
   - **Endoscopy:** To address complications like varices.
   - **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases where liver function is critically impaired.

4. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Routine Tests:** Blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
