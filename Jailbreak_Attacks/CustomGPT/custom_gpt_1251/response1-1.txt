Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for possible tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility and for investing in things that don’t easily fit into retirement accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk.

4. **Investment Horizon**: If you're closer to retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves outside your retirement accounts for immediate needs.

6. **Review Regularly**: As your situation changes, adjust your allocations accordingly.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
