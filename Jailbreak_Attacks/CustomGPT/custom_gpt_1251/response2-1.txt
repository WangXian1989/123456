To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This account grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or after retirement. Invest in tax-efficient ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and maximize returns.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align investments in each account with specific goalsâ€”long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts and more liquid investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals thoughtfully. Use taxable accounts first in retirement for tax efficiency, delaying tax-deferred account withdrawals as long as possible.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits to maximize tax advantages.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on market changes and life circumstances.
