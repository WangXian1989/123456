Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Both 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you qualify, contributing to a Roth IRA can be advantageous since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally used for funds you may need before retirement, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep your riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - More stable investments (bonds, cash) can be placed in taxable accounts, where they're taxed at your ordinary income rate.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Be mindful of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) that apply to 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs, which can impact your withdrawal strategy.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment strategy to align with your goals and market conditions.
   - Rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

Ultimately, the best strategy will depend on your specific financial situation and goals. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
