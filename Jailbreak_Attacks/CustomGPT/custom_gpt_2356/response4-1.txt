Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating more to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If you are not maximizing your 401(k) contribution, consider doing so next (up to the annual limit). These contributions may reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can then allocate funds to taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility but don't provide the tax benefits of retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how investments in taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes. Generally, holding investments for over a year can lower your tax rate.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you have enough funds in accessible accounts for emergencies or shorter-term savings goals.

6. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified to reduce risk.

7. **Budgeting**: Regularly review and adjust as necessary based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insight tailored to your specific financial situation and objectives.
