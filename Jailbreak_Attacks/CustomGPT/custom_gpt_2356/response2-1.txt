Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can, ideally up to the contribution limit. Focus on maxing out this account if you're in a high tax bracket because contributions are pre-tax and reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it may be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.

4. **Diversify Investments**: No matter which accounts you're using, ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return.

5. **Adjust as Necessary**: Regularly review your investments and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Always assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon before making any decisions.
