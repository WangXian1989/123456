Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contribution Max:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. Consider your future tax bracket when withdrawing.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Good for tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible depending on income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Useful for short-term goals or emergencies since you can withdraw without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

### **Sample Distribution Strategy**
- **Contribute:** Max out your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- **Prioritize:** Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, then back to the 401(k) until max contribution limits are reached.
- **Allocate:** Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts.

### **Review Regularly**
- Make adjustments based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

**Consult a financial advisor** for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
