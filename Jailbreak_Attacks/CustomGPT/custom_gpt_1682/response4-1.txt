When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. If you're under 50, the contribution limit is $22,500 for 2024 (or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation, with a contribution limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50 in 2024).

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, focusing on different asset allocations suitable for your risk tolerance.
   - Keep higher-growth assets, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Be mindful of realizing gains and losses for tax optimization, such as tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid form, and only invest excess funds after ensuring your immediate financial health.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Work towards a holistic financial plan that considers your retirement timeline, expected expenses, and desired lifestyle.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation, preferably with the guidance of a financial advisor.
