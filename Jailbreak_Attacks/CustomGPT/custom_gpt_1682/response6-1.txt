When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Investment Options**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers limited investment choices; focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA:** Greater flexibilityâ€”consider a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate lower taxes (like long-term capital gains) or for saving for goals within a few years.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Current vs. Future Tax Rates:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA). If you expect higher taxes, consider Roth options.

### 4. **Maintain Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some cash in taxable accounts for immediate needs or emergencies, balancing growth potential and liquidity.

### Summary
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.**
- **Diversify investment types based on account type.**
- **Align with your tax strategy and liquidity needs.**

Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on your financial goals and market conditions.
