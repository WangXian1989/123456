To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of pre-tax contributions, which lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on if it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider your tax situation for the year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. They offer flexibility but are less tax-efficient.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate investments between these accounts to manage risk. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and consider holding bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your objectives (retirement, buying a home, etc.). Long-term goals can benefit from stock exposure in tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term might require more stable investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

Consider your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon as you make these decisions.
