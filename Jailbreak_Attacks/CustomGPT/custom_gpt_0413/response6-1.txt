To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: A higher allocation in equities within your tax-advantaged accounts may yield better long-term returns.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets in your taxable account for flexibility without penalties.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to benefit from lower tax rates.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Favor bonds or high-turnover investments here to defer taxes on interest and short-term gains.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Revisit your allocations periodically (e.g., annually) to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Engaging with a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights based on your unique situation and goals.
