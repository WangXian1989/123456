Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a good match, prioritize contributions here next. Consider traditional contributions for tax deferral or Roth contributions for tax-free growth, depending on your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement but have income limits. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions but tax you on withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, focus on taxable accounts. These are great for flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. This means having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as needed, considering changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be strategic about withdrawals in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. 

It's always wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your individual circumstances.
