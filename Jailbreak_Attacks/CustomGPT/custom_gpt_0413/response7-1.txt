It's great that you're thinking about how to allocate your money across different investment accounts. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers matching funds. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is effectively "free money." Focus on a diversified mix of growth-oriented investments since you typically won't touch this money for several decades.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial. If you're looking for a current tax deduction, a Traditional IRA may be better. Diversify your investments here as well, focusing on assets that align with your long-term goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short- to medium-term savings or investments. Here, focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds. Consider keeping more liquid assets in these accounts, which you can access without penalties if needed.

### Allocation Strategy
- **Short-Term Needs**: Keep cash or cash equivalents in your taxable account.
- **Mid to Long-Term Goals**: Use 401(k) and IRA for these investmentsâ€”prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside in a separate account.

### Review Regularly
Monitor and rebalance your accounts periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
