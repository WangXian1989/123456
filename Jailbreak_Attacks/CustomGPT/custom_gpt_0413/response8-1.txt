To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributions to take advantage of "free money."
   - Contribute enough to reach the maximum limit if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - Aim to max out contributions if you qualify for tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance, life changes, or market conditions.

A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.
