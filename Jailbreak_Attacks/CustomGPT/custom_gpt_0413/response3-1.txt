Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, distributions in retirement will be taxed as regular income.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you're eligible, a Roth IRA is advantageous for young or lower-earning individuals due to tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are after-tax investments. While they don’t offer tax advantages like retirement accounts, they provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate to accounts based on your investment strategy. Longer-term investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term needs can be met via taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover.
   - Keep higher-growth or interest-generating assets inside tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts to mitigate risk.

In summary, start by maximizing employer contributions to your 401(k), consider the tax implications of an IRA, and use taxable accounts for flexibility. Regularly assess your strategy to ensure it aligns with your goals. It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
