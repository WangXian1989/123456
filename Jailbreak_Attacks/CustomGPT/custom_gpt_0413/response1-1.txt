To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Assess Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in tax treatment; consider this if you want more tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize this option.
   - **Taxable Account**: Offers flexibility for short-term goals. You’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits, so it’s more suited for investments you might need to access sooner.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: Align each account with your financial goals:
   - Long-term growth (retirement): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRAs).
   - Short- to medium-term goals: Consider a taxable account for liquidity.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio within each account. Depending on your risk tolerance, mix stocks, bonds, and other investments.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Make regular contributions to each account based on your financial strategy and goals.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Monitor your investments periodically and adjust your contributions as needed based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage your investments across different account types to optimize growth and minimize taxes.
