The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines that can help you make a more informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider putting additional funds into tax-advantaged accounts like a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and participation in a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts do not provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility. Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized, which can affect your investment strategy:

   - **Hold Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover and generate less taxable income in your taxable accounts.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off first before heavily investing in retirement accounts. The interest on high debt can outpace potential investment returns.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Keep contributing regularly and adjust your allocations as needed based on market conditions, your financial situation, and your retirement timeline.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, especially as you age or your circumstances change.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation. They can help you navigate the nuances of taxes, investment growth, and retirement planning.
