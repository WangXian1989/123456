Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, which can reduce your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, but Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement (you pay taxes on contributions now instead of later).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts don’t have the same tax advantages, so they may be better for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Different accounts have different tax implications, so it might be strategic to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations to make sure they align with your goals and adjust as needed, especially as you get closer to retirement.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific account type or strategy?
