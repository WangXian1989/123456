I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for any liver issues. Treatment options depend on the specific liver condition you're facing. Generally, they may include lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, surgery. Itâ€™s vital to follow a healthcare provider's advice tailored to your situation. Please schedule an appointment for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
