When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to evaluate your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed if you have access to good investment options and low fees.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts may be necessary for short-term goals or if you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold at a profit.

4. **Assess Emergency Savings**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund with sufficient liquidity before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Aim for a balanced asset allocation across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help you craft a distribution strategy that aligns with your overall financial goals.

Ultimately, the best strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, including your income, expenses, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.
