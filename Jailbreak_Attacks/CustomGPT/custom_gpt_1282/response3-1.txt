To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the funds, typically in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts do not have tax advantages, but they also allow for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) limits are typically higher than IRA limits).
   - Maximize employer matches in your 401(k), as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your financial goals and time horizon. 401(k) and IRA accounts are typically better for long-term growth due to their tax advantages.
   - Taxable accounts can be more suited for short-term goals or accessible funds because you can withdraw without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all account types. Each account can hold various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, age, and financial objectives.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Many choose to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow for a longer period.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If in doubt, consult a financial advisor who can help create a personalized distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Overall, it's essential to balance your contributions, taking advantage of tax benefits while ensuring that you have liquidity and flexibility as needed.
