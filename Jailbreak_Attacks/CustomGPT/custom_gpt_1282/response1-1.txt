Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment choices within your 401(k) plan. If options are limited or have high fees, you may want to allocate less here.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible in the year you make them, which is advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket now. Taxes will be owed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.
   - **Maximum Contributions**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older). Try to maximize contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and can be accessed without penalty. They are suitable for short-term goals or large purchases.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax, so consider tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs.
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may have higher turnover or are expected to generate significant taxable income (like high-yield bonds).

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts.
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Typically, itâ€™s wise to fund your 401(k) to the employer match, then max out an IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts.
- **Reassessment**: Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, life goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
