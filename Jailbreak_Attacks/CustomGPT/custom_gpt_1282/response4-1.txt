To provide tailored advice on distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I would need some additional information, such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, current asset allocation, and investment preferences. However, I can outline some general strategies that many individuals consider:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Maximize your contributions to these accounts to benefit from tax deferred growth.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, ensure you at least contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction upfront.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in a taxable account. This account offers more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals but comes with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. Younger individuals may opt for a more aggressive portfolio, while those closer to retirement may choose a conservative approach.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Consider low-cost index funds or ETFs for diversification, especially in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your goals.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized financial planning to ensure you're making the most efficient use of each account type in context to your overall financial situation. Would you like more information on any specific aspect?
