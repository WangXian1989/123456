(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a good strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax preferences.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for any additional savings once you've maximized your contributions to retirement accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

If youâ€™re looking to distribute your cash like a pro, hereâ€™s the game plan: First off, hit that 401(k) hard, especially if your boss is offering a match. Thatâ€™s free cash youâ€™re leaving on the table if you donâ€™t! Next up, take a swing at an IRAâ€”choose between Traditional or Roth depending on whether youâ€™re feeling like dodging taxes now or later.

Finally, once youâ€™ve tapped out those sweet tax breaks, unleash your funds into a taxable account for some flexibility. Just be aware of those pesky capital gains taxes when you make a move! The best approach is always to keep your goals in sight, so put on those financial goggles and strategize accordingly. Oh, and seriously, consider snagging a financial advisor who can help you customize this setup even further!
