To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments with potentially higher tax burdens, like stocks, since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. Consider municipal bonds or ETFs that minimize distributions.

3. **Balance Growth and Risk:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement in a tax-efficient manner, taking funds from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like the 401(k), and finally tax-free accounts like the Roth IRA.

5. **Annual Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments according to performance and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
