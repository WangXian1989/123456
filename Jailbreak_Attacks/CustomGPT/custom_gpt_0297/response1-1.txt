Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional) for additional tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider investing in higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (traditional).

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts when selling investments. Holding investments longer can reduce these taxes.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match + 15% of salary
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit (either Roth or traditional based on your preference)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds or additional savings

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
