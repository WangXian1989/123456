Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for funds you'll need before retirement. Keep investments that generate lower taxes here, like index funds or stocks held long-term.

### 3. **Balance Contribution Levels:**
   - Prioritize contributions based on fees and investment options available in your 401(k), and then fund your IRA.

### 4. **Invest for Growth in Retirement Accounts:**
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit from tax deferral.

### 5. **Diversify by Account Type:**
   - Maintain a mix of stocks and bonds in each account type based on your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your investment allocations periodically to stay aligned with your goals.

### Example Distribution Approach:
1. **401(k):** Max employer match + 10-15% of your salary.
2. **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount ($6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for additional investments.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
For personalized advice based on your individual circumstances, consider working with a financial advisor. 

This approach helps optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
