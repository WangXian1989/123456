To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the maximum annual contribution limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50). Choose Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or traditional for immediate tax deductions.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Tailor your investment strategy based on when you plan to access the funds. Younger investors might favor growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement may prioritize stability.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation across these accounts to maintain your desired risk level. 

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized guidance, especially considering your unique financial situation and goals, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
