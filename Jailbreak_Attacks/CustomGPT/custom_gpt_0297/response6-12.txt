Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Diet: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune issues.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Frequent blood tests to monitor liver function and determine treatment effectiveness.

4. **Advanced Treatments:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice.
