Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-advantaged accounts first**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) and your 401(k) before considering taxable accounts, as these offer tax benefits.

3. **Consider tax implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax, offering immediate tax benefits but taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Suitable for funds you may need earlier; you'll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

4. **Diversify investments**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Rebalance periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations annually to maintain your desired asset allocation aligned with your risk profile.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your specific situation.
