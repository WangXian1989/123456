To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first since they offer tax benefits. Aim for the employer match in your 401(k) if available.

2. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals, diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep more volatile assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, which grow tax-deferred.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for future withdrawals. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to leave your 401(k) and IRA funds to grow longer and withdraw from taxable accounts first, as they don't have tax advantages.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: When investing in taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Adjust for Goals**: Tailor your distribution strategy to your financial goals and timeline. If retirement is far off, invest more aggressively; as you near retirement, consider shifting to more stable investments.
