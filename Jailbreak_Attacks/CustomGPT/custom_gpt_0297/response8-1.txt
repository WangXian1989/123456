To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Focus on maximizing employer matching contributions.
   - Prioritize contributions up to the match to take full advantage of free money.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for potential tax-free withdrawals.
   - Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, especially if your current tax rate is higher than expected retirement rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in a diversified portfolio, considering capital gains taxes.
   - Allocate funds for short-term goals or emergencies here, as withdrawals are easier without penalties.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings before heavy investing.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your risk tolerance and age. Younger investors may lean towards aggressive growth, while older individuals might prefer conservative options.
- **Asset Location:** Place high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-growth (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### Conclusion:
Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and tax considerations.
