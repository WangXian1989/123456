Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic decision that can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals:
   - **Retirement Savings:** If your primary goal is retirement savings, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** For goals within the next few years, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 2. Maximize Employer Contributions:
   - **401(k) Match:** If your employer offers a match in the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially “free money.”

### 3. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 4. Consider the Tax Implications:
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Money in taxable accounts is subject to capital gains taxes. You may want to reserve these accounts for investments expected to grow more slowly or provide income, which may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Withdrawals:** Plan for how and when you intend to withdraw these funds, especially from tax-advantaged accounts since early withdrawals may incur penalties.

### 5. Diversify Investments:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to minimize risk and enhance potential returns.

### 6. Rebalance Regularly:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% of total investment
- **IRA:** 30% of total investment
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% of total investment

### Conclusion:
Balance your contributions based on your financial situation, taking advantage of employer matches and tax benefits, while keeping liquidity in mind for your taxable accounts.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances and goals.
