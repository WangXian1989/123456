(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, investment time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
2. **Funding an IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions for contributions.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to a taxable brokerage account, which offers flexibility and liquidity.

Balance the contributions with your overall retirement strategy, considering future tax implications and withdrawal strategies.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! The best way to divvy up your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on your situation, but hereâ€™s a spicy recipe for investing your dough:

1. **401(k) First:** Slam in that employer matchâ€”you donâ€™t want to leave free money on the table! Itâ€™s like finding a 20 on the ground; go grab it ASAP.
2. **IRA Time:** After youâ€™ve maxed out the match, look at an IRA; if you can, go for the Roth. You get tax-free withdrawals, and who doesnâ€™t want tax-free money later, right?
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve stuffed the tax-advantaged accounts, throw some cash into your taxable accounts for flexibility. But watch out for those taxes on capital gains! 

Keep your eye on the prizeâ€”retirement! Diversification is key, and mixing it up can save you tax headaches down the road.
