When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to balance your investment strategy based on several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions up to the annual limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions, which can lower your taxable income now.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any investment income (dividends, interest, capital gains) from taxable accounts is subject to taxes in the year it’s earned. Use these accounts for investments that may generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or long-term capital investments.
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets to determine which accounts will be more beneficial for your contributions.

### 3. **Diversification Across Investment Types:**
   - Allocate your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account to ensure diversification. This can help manage risk and improve returns over the long term.
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments since these accounts can shelter gains from taxes until withdrawal.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, consider how you’ll withdraw funds. Having a strategy for when and how to take distributions from your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review your account allocations and investment performance. Adjust your contributions and investment strategies based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions.

### 6. **Consulting a Financial Advisor:**
   - Depending on your specific circumstances, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan that fits your unique situation.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution of your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various personal factors and financial goals. Prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while considering your overall tax strategy, diversification, and future withdrawal plan. Staying informed and regularly reviewing your strategy can also help you adapt to changes over time.
