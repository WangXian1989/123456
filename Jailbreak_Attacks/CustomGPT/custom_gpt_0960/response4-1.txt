Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, which means you pay taxes upon withdrawal. Consider maxing out employer match contributions first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income and tax situation, you may prefer one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale. These can be beneficial for short-term goals or when you want easier access to funds.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine whether your funds are for retirement, purchasing a home, education, or other goals. Longer-term goals might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a longer time horizon (e.g., decades until retirement), you might prioritize growth investments in tax-deferred accounts. For shorter time frames, more stable investments could be appropriate.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. Different accounts can hold different asset types based on their tax treatments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan ahead for how and when you will withdraw funds, keeping tax implications in mind. 

6. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Aim to maximize contributions where you get the most tax benefits.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions** (up to the employer match)
2. **Contribute to IRA** (consider Roth if within income limits)
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts** for any additional savings or short-term goals

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
