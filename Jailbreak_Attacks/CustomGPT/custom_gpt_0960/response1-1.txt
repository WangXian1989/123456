Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for optimizing your tax situation and maximizing your investment growth. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is effectively free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Choose between traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) based on your future tax expectations.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Types**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth upon qualified withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2024, $7,500 if youâ€™re over 50).
   - **Tax Diversification**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easy access to funds without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Capital Gains**: Investments held more than a year are taxed at lower capital gains rates compared to ordinary income.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max out the 401(k)** to at least the employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (Roth or Traditional) based on your tax situation.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts** with any remaining funds, focusing on long-term investments to minimize taxes.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies outside of these accounts.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your strategy with your retirement timeline and financial goals.
- **Tax Strategy**: Consult with a financial advisor for personalized tax strategies and asset allocation.

Balancing these accounts effectively depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
