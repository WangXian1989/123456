When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about a few key factors: your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a basic framework to help you decide:

### 1. **Prioritize Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that don’t fit in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or have significant growth potential (like stock funds).
   - Hold investments that may generate lower taxes in taxable accounts (like index funds or stocks held long-term).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Understand the tax treatment of withdrawals from each account. Traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes, so consider your trading strategy and the tax implications of frequent buying/selling.

### 4. **Age and Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you’re closer to retirement, prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA to ensure you're maximizing your retirement savings and minimizing taxes.
   - If you have a longer time horizon, consider investing aggressively in retirement accounts and using taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Current Contributions:** 50% to 401(k) (up to match), 30% to IRA, 20% to taxable accounts.
- **Adjust as Necessary:** Regularly review and adjust your distribution based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial goals.

Ultimately, the best strategy can vary widely based on individual circumstances, so consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can provide personalized guidance.
