Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, although you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) in all accounts. This can help manage risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation and goals change over time.
