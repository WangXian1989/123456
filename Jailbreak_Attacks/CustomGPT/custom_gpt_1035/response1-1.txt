To allocate your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider several factors including investment goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Here’s a structured approach to help guide your decision:

### Module 1: Understand Each Account Type

1. **401(k)**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions often made pre-tax; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Employer Match**: Take full advantage of any employer match—this is essentially “free money”.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and above).

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are due on withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals (if qualified) are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).
   - **Income Limits**: Make sure you qualify for contributions to a Roth IRA if considering this.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: No contribution limits or restrictions on withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Interested in capital gains and income; consider tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds, ETFs).
   - **Purpose**: Ideal for short- to medium-term goals or as a source of supplemental retirement income.

### Module 2: Strategies for Distribution

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, assessing whether a traditional or Roth IRA suits you best based on your current tax situation.

2. **Balance Between Account Types**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider dividing funds into taxable accounts.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for assets that could generate capital gains and dividends taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - If funds are needed sooner (for a home, education, etc.), allocate more to taxable accounts.
   - For long-term retirement savings, increase contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.

### Module 3: Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation

- **Assess your risk tolerance** based on age, income, and how comfortable you are with market fluctuations.
- Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account based on that tolerance.

### Key Takeaways

- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts.
- Diversify across account types based on your investment timeline and goals.
- Consider tax implications of investments and withdrawals from each account.
