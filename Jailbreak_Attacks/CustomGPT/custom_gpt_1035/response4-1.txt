Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your overall financial goals, tax implications, and retirement strategy. Let’s break down the factors to consider for each type of account in a modular format.

### Module 1: Overview of Account Types

1. **401(k)**
   - Employer-sponsored retirement account.
   - Contributions are often pre-tax, deferring taxation until withdrawal.
   - May have employer matching contributions.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax).
   - Contribution limits exist; for 2023, the maximum is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).
   - Allows for a wider array of investment choices.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Investment accounts that can be used for any purpose.
   - Money can be withdrawn at any time without penalty.
   - Subject to capital gains taxes on realized gains.

### Module 2: Factors to Consider

1. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**
   - Define short-term versus long-term financial goals.
   - Generally, long-term investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping short-term goals in taxable accounts.

2. **Tax Bracket**
   - Higher-income individuals may benefit more from tax-deferred accounts due to long-term tax savings.
   - Lower-income individuals might benefit from Roth accounts where withdrawals can be tax-free.

3. **Withdrawal Needs**
   - Understand your needs for liquidity, particularly if you expect to need funds before retirement.
   - 401(k) and IRA funds are typically less accessible without penalties before age 59½.

### Module 3: Distribution Strategy

1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - After maximizing the match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions (especially if it’s a Roth IRA, depending on your income).

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**
   - Once your IRAs are maxed out, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum contribution limit for the year.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Any extra funds beyond your retirement account limits can be placed in a taxable account. Consider low-turnover investments to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### Key Takeaways
- Utilize employer matching in your 401(k) first.
- Prioritize maxing out IRAs.
- Continue investing in your 401(k) after IRA contributions.
- Place excess funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Final Thoughts
Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as your goals, market conditions, and tax situations change. Diversification across different account types can prepare you better for varying economic scenarios.
