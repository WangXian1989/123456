To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to understand the characteristics of each account type and how they fit into your overall financial strategy. Here's a breakdown:

### Module 1: Overview of Account Types
1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **Employer Match**: Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   
2. **IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts)**
   - **Traditional vs Roth**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Lower than 401(k) limits; make sure to maximize contributions, especially if you qualify for Roth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: No contribution limits or withdrawal penalties.
   - **Tax Implications**: Subject to capital gains tax on profits, but this can help manage your taxes with careful selling strategies.

### Module 2: Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match First**
   - *Action*: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - *Reason*: This is immediate return on investment and a key strategy before other contributions.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - *Action*: Prioritize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing the 401(k) match.
   - *Reason*: These accounts have tax advantages that can enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Remainder to Taxable Accounts**
   - *Action*: Allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts.
   - *Reason*: These funds can be withdrawn anytime without penalties if you need liquidity.

### Module 3: Additional Considerations
- **Investment Strategy**: Align your investments in each account according to their tax treatment.
  - *Example*: Consider placing higher-growth assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts since they grow tax-free.

- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Have a plan for how and when you’ll withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes.
  
### Key Takeaways
- Start with maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- After that, focus on your IRA contributions for tax advantages.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and potential investments when maxed out on tax-advantaged accounts.
