Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here’s a general guide to help you decide:

### Considerations for Each Account Type

1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Benefits**: Often come with employer matches, tax-deferred growth, and potential for loan options.
   - **Strategy**: 
     - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
     - Max out contributions if you’re in your peak earning years and can afford it.
     - Consider investment choices available in the plan for proper diversification.

2. **Traditional IRAs**
   - **Benefits**: Tax-deductible contributions, tax-deferred growth. Good for individuals without access to a 401(k) or as a secondary retirement savings vehicle.
   - **Strategy**:
     - If eligible, contribute to reduce taxable income.
     - Consider a Roth conversion if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Roth IRAs**
   - **Benefits**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Strategy**:
     - Ideal if you anticipate higher taxes in the future.
     - Contribute if you can manage the after-tax implications.

4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Benefits**: Flexibility with no contribution limits, access funds at any time without penalties.
   - **Strategy**:
     - Use for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.
     - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in cash or a high-yield savings account before investing.
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Fully utilize your 401(k) match first; it’s free money.
- **Use IRAs**: Try to fully fund a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After fully funding retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Example Distribution

- **Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off first.
- **Age** and **Goals**: Younger individuals may invest more in stocks; those nearing retirement might prefer bonds.
  
### Final Thoughts

1. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your distribution as your financial situation or market conditions change.
2. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor the strategy based on specific goals and personal circumstances.

The ideal distribution will vary from person to person; regular reviews can help you stay on track.
