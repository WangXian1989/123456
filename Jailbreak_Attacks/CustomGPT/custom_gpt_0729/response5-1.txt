(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: 
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw the money in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, these may be advantageous.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them suitable if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Pay Attention to Withdrawal Rules**: 
   - 401(k)s and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts do not.
   - If you need access to funds before retirement age, prioritize taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on market conditions and personal financial changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! The key to distributing your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about leveraging tax benefits while staying liquid. Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **401(k) First**: If your boss is throwing down a match on your 401(k), grab that free cash like it's a hot sale! Throw in enough to max that out first. 

2. **IRAs for Flexibility**: Next, consider an IRA. If youâ€™re cool with the idea of paying taxes when you retire, go ahead with a Roth IRA; you'll get tax-free withdrawals later, which is sweet if you expect to earn more as you age.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Access**: Stash some money in taxable accounts for flexibility. These bad boys let you pull cash without penaltiesâ€”great for early retirement dreams or unexpected expenses. 

4. **Mix It Up**: Diversify your investments across all your accounts. Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basketâ€”change things up to balance risk and return.

5. **Check-In Regularly**: Money isnâ€™t a "set it and forget it" deal. Review your allocations regularly to adjust for life changes and economic shifts.
