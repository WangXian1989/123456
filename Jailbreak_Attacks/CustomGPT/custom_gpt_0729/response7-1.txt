To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Leverage Tax Benefits:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if you have access to employer matching in your 401(k).
   - Focus on tax-advantaged accounts as they often offer tax deductions or tax-free growth.

2. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund with at least 3-6 months' living expenses in a liquid savings account before heavily investing.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within accounts to spread risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Future Tax Bracket:**
   - Contemplate your expected income and tax brackets at retirement. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) may be more beneficial than Roth options.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consulting a financial advisor can help you tailor a plan that fits your unique needs.

By using these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective approach to managing your retirement and investment accounts.
