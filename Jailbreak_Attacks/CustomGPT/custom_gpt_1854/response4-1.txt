When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be considered, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, which can lower your taxable income in the year of the contribution. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts** can be beneficial for more immediate financial goals or emergency funds, but they are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Assess Your Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (and an additional $7,500 for those over 50), $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 for those over 50), with no limit on taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Depending on your investment strategy, consider allocating different types of investments across different accounts. High-growth stocks might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to tax implications.

5. **Emergency Fund First**: Before heavily contributing to retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a readily accessible account.

6. **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals**: If you have short-term financial needs, prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity. For long-term retirement goals, focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: As financial situations can be unique, consider working with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances.

By balancing contributions across these accounts based on your financial situation and goals, you can optimize your retirement savings for the future.
