Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the limit if you can (for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement (contribution limit is $6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts for better tax treatment.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be advantageous. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, prioritize 401(k) / traditional IRA contributions.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before heavily investing.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting a financial advisor might also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
