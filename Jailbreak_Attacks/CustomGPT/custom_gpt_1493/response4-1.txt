Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often offers matching contributions; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Provides tax advantages. Traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access; pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Beneficial for high-income earners reducing taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Suitable for short-term savings or investments with lower tax burdens (e.g., qualified dividends, long-term capital gains).

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.
   - **Fund IRAs:** Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and income limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing retirement accounts, allocate extra funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust the mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your comfort level and investment timeline.
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across different asset types to manage risk.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing goals.

### 5. **Approach by Age:**
   - **Younger Individuals:** Focus more on growth-oriented investments, mainly in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Closer to Retirement:** Gradually shift to conservative investments, ensuring some funds are accessible in taxable accounts.

### Example Distribution:
- **40% in 401(k)**
- **30% in IRA (split between Traditional and Roth based on tax situation)**
- **30% in Taxable Accounts**

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can help assess your financial goals, tax strategy, and investment plan.

### Conclusion
Balancing your distributions involves assessing immediate financial needs, long-term goals, and tax considerations. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your allocations will ensure alignment with your evolving financial landscape.
