To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA first. This provides immediate tax benefits and potential employer matching.
   - **Consider Roth IRA**: If eligible, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it a powerful long-term investment vehicle.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider municipal bonds for tax-free income.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Hold assets that generate substantial income or capital gains, such as bonds or actively managed funds, since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 3. **Rebalancing and Adjusting**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This can help mitigate risk and enhance returns.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax liabilities, utilizing the sequence of withdrawals from each account type effectively.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For tailored advice, especially considering changing tax laws, consult a financial advisor to align your distribution strategy with your personal financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money across your accounts to maximize growth and minimize tax impact over time.
