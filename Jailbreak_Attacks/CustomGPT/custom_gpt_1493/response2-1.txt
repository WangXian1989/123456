Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible (up to $22,500 for 2023, plus catch-up contributions if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50+).

### 2. **Consider Asset Location**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These are good for holding higher-growth investments (like stocks) that would generate significant capital gains or dividends because you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Ideal for investments you expect will grow significantly. You won't pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more stable investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) to minimize tax exposure from capital gains.

### 3. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This could range from conservative (more bonds) to aggressive (more stocks). Regularly rebalance your portfolio across all accounts.

### 4. **Be Mindful of Withdrawals**
   - Plan retirement withdrawals effectively. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and leave Roth accounts for last to maximize tax-free growth.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Individual circumstances can vary significantly. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By following these guidelines and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can create a well-optimized distribution plan tailored to your financial future.
