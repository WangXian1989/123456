Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Account Types**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs first, as they provide tax benefits.
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 contribution limit (as of 2023), plus $7,500 if you're over 50.
     - **IRA**: $6,500 limit, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or investments that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - Consider your marginal tax rate when choosing account types. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) contributions for tax-free withdrawals.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally:
     - **Younger Investors**: More equity exposure.
     - **Older Investors**: Shift towards bonds and safer assets as retirement approaches.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your intended asset allocation across all accounts.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, which can affect your tax liabilities. Typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 50% of your total investment
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

Ultimately, tailor your distribution to fit your specific needs, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
