The optimal allocation of funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is effectively "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, starting with the 401(k) and then the IRA. Both accounts can provide tax benefits, which may help your investments grow more efficiently over time.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 if you are 50 or older) and up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you are 50 or older). 

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may also provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income and tax situation, choose the one that best aligns with your future tax expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer the same tax benefits, so consider using them for investments that may generate frequent taxable events (like dividends or capital gains) or for funds that you might need in the short term.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the accounts, ensure a diversified investment strategy across all platforms. Different accounts can hold a variety of asset types, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Regularly review your contributions and asset allocation to ensure they align with your current objectives and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
