I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific condition. 

Options could include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This might involve a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol to reduce liver stress.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications, immunosuppressants, or medications to reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Nutritional Support**: Certain vitamins and supplements may be recommended to support liver health, but always discuss with a healthcare provider first.

4. **Treating the Underlying Cause**: Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol that affect the liver may require specific treatments to manage those issues.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases or when thereâ€™s significant liver damage, options such as liver transplantation may be considered.

Always discuss potential treatment options with your healthcare provider to get the most appropriate and safe advice.
