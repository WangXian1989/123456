Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if you can. These accounts provide tax benefits, either through tax-deferred investment growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your employer's match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out these accounts, you can continue to contribute to your 401(k) or open a taxable investment account.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments, focusing on a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for investments that generate income since you may pay taxes on dividends and interest. Consider long-term investments that can benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then from tax-deferred accounts, and finally from tax-free accounts to minimize your tax burden during retirement.

5. **Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation, as they can provide insights tailored to your financial goals and tax strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial objectives.
