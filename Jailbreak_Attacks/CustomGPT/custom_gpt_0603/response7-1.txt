Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)), reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain criteria are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to taxes each year (interest, dividends, capital gains). However, they offer flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Prioritize Accounts by Tax Efficiency**:
   - Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - If you have maxed contributions to these accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Review Periodically**: Life circumstances and financial goals change, so it’s essential to review your strategy regularly, ideally annually.

It's often advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- 401(k): 10-15% of your pre-tax income (to max out the employer match)
- IRA: Contribute the maximum limit each year (if eligible)
- Taxable Accounts: Use any additional savings or funds not needed for short-term goals

This balancing act helps maximize your retirement savings while considering tax implications.

### Conclusion
Always consider your unique financial situation, goals, and tax circumstances when determining the best distribution strategy.
