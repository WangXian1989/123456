(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. A general guideline is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, aim to maximize contributions up to the legal limit.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you meet the eligibility requirements, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is often preferred for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and can be advantageous for short-term goals.

Consider your overall asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

1. **Go Big on Your 401(k)**: First off, max out that 401(k) contribution, especially if your employer is matching. Itâ€™s like finding free cash lying aroundâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **Hit Up the IRA**: Next, dive into an IRA. If youâ€™re looking at a Roth, great choice for tax-free growth later. If youâ€™re more traditional, thatâ€™s cool tooâ€”just remember the tax hit when you pull that cash in retirement!

3. **Taxable Playground**: Once youâ€™ve stuffed your 401(k) and IRA, throw the rest into a taxable account. It gives you more flexibility because, letâ€™s be real, life happens. You want access to your cash without penalties.

Just keep an eye on your investments and rebalance as needed. And hey, if you need a clearer plan or feel like you're lost in the financial jungle, hit up a financial advisor who can help you rock your investment strategy! ðŸ’¸
