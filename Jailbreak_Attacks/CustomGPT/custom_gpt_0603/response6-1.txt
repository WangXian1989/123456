Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your current financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals. Here are some general principles to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you can, contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial in retirement.

### 2. **Consider the Tax Implications:**
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Post-Tax:** 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. A Roth IRA uses after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that are expected to generate capital gains or dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Balance for Flexibility and Growth:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors might allocate more to equities for growth, gradually shifting to bonds as retirement approaches.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

### Suggested Distribution Overall:
1. **Maximize 401(k)** contributions up to the employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRAs** based on income limits and your financial goals.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** for liquidity and flexibility, focusing on long-term growth investments to minimize taxes.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income, maxing out employer match.
- **Traditional/Roth IRA:** Contribute up to the annual limit ($6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional savings or funds for short-term goals.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution aligns with your specific needs and goals. It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that takes into account your unique situation and future aspirations.
