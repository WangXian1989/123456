Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is effectively free money.
   - **Tax-deferred Growth**: Since contributions are pre-tax, prioritize this account for higher-income years (reducing taxable income).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA (income limits apply), consider contributing here for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Limitations**: Note that IRAs have lower contribution limits compared to 401(k)s, so balance contributions based on your overall tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **Prioritize the 401(k)**: Contribute enough for the employer match.
- **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA contributions after the 401(k) match.
- **Taxable Investments**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings, especially for goals outside of retirement.

### Additional Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment choices based on your risk profile.
- **Consider Future Needs**: Plan withdrawals based on when you anticipate needing the funds.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
