Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, future goals, tax considerations, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this. The contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level, contribute to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Investments grow tax-free or tax-deferred, making these accounts a good place for high-growth assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate income, like bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs), because long-term capital gains tax rates are typically lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your portfolio is balanced across your accounts, taking advantage of various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement strategically, using tax considerations to minimize tax liability over time.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your account allocations and investment performance. Adjust contributions based on changes in income, market conditions, and life goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
