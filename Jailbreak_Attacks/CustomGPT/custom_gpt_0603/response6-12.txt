I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a tailored approach. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Modifications:** A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health.
   - **Weight Management:** Maintaining a healthy weight can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Corticosteroids:** These may be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help track liver function and detect any changes.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplant might be necessary for patients with end-stage liver disease.

Always work with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
