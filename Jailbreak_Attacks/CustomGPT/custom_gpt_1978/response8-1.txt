To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to optimize this benefit first. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. Next, consider maximizing your contributions, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level, contribute to a traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax). Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income regularly, such as dividend-paying stocks or interest-bearing bonds. This way, you can take advantage of favorable long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Match your investment choices with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, longer time horizons can afford to take more risks.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio between accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts to mitigate risk. This can involve spreading investments across different asset classes.

7. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: As you withdraw funds in retirement, consider how much tax you’ll pay on withdrawals from each account type. Strategic withdrawals can help minimize tax burdens.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation.
