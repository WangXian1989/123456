Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributions to take full advantage of this "free money." Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maximizing contributions.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Invest in assets with higher growth potential (like stocks), as the taxes can be deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds) or low-turnover index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before heavily investing.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and life changes.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By focusing on tax efficiency and aligning with your goals, you can optimize your investment across these accounts.
