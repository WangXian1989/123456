Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Prioritize maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits. Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains at lower tax rates or for cash reserves, as they don't have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-term goals**: Focus on accounts with better growth potential (like a 401(k) or IRA) for long-term investments.
   - **Short-term needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Distribute investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts for balanced risk and returns.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust allocations based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions. This ensures your risk remains aligned with your investment strategy.

### Conclusion
A tailored approach based on your unique financial situation will yield the best results. It may also be worth consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
