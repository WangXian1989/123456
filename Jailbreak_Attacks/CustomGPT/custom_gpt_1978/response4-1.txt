To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. The annual contribution limits for 2023 are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if 50+)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50+)

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your current tax bracket and expected retirement income. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any funds beyond your retirement accounts can be placed in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance. Typically, it’s wise to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like growth stocks) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities on interest and dividends.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically reassess your contributions and asset allocation based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in income.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
