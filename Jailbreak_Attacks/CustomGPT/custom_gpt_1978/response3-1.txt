Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your tax benefits and investment growth. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Continue with the 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions, ideally up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement contributions. They offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and don’t have the penalties associated with early 401(k) or IRA withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments in each account. For example:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Hold investments with higher growth potential (like stocks), as taxes are deferred or minimized until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or ETFs, to reduce capital gains tax.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, goals, and changing tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly, so professional advice tailored to your situation can help optimize your strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with both your short-term and long-term financial goals.
