To optimize your investment distribution across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing contributions here for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact. Consider bonds or investments with lower turnover.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) here since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 3. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your allocation to ensure it reflects your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 4. **Utilize Tax Loss Harvesting**:
   - In your taxable accounts, sell underperforming investments to offset gains, reducing your tax burden.

#### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts**.
- **Consider asset types based on their tax implications** in different accounts.
- **Review and rebalance regularly** to maintain alignment with financial objectives. 

This approach will help optimize your investment strategy while minimizing taxes and maximizing growth potential.
