I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Treatment can vary based on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Medical professionals may recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies depending on your situation. It's important to seek personalized advice from a qualified source.
