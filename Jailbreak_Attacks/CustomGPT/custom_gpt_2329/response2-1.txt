Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider for optimizing your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now (but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can be beneficial for funds you'll need before retirement or for investments that might benefit from favorable long-term capital gains tax rates. Try to allocate investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) to tax-advantaged accounts and those with lower capital gains to taxable accounts.

4. **Assess Your Investment Goals**: Determine your risk tolerance and financial goals to decide how much to allocate to each account type. For example, if you have a longer time horizon, you might tilt your investments toward stocks in retirement accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account before maximizing retirement contributions. Typically, 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses in a savings account is advisable.

6. **Diversification**: Within each account type, maintain a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Periodic Review**: Reassess your allocations regularly to account for changes in your life circumstances, market conditions, or financial goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific situation. They can help you devise a comprehensive strategy to optimize your investments across different account types.
