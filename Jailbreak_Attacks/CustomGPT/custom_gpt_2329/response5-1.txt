(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it can be beneficial to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. A common strategy is:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider whether you want to continue maximizing contributions based on your income and tax situation.

2. **IRA**: Next, you can contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax preferences. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any remaining money into taxable investment accounts. These accounts can provide flexibility for accessing funds if needed.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your job's throwing you a match, shove in enough dough to snag that freebie! No brainer, right? After that, consider maxing it out if your salary allowsâ€”think of it as unfollowing short-term taxation and playing the long game.
