Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds to your IRA or taxable accounts.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are tax-advantaged, meaning you won't pay taxes on your contributions or earnings until you withdraw the money (except for Roth accounts, which are tax-free on withdrawal).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these accounts don't offer the same tax benefits, they provide flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing here.

3. **Investment Goals**: 
   - For retirement savings, prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they allow for more substantial growth over time without immediate tax implications.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and reward. Each account can hold various asset classes, but consider your overall asset allocation.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older)

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute to these accounts, review and rebalance your investments periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Before making any investment decisions, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a customized plan based on your specific circumstances.
