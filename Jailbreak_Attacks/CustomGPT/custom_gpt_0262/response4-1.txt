To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are suitable for investments with lower expected returns (like bonds) or for assets you'll need access to before retirement. Also, consider investments that generate qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Selection**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented funds, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type, utilize a mix of stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Align investments with your time horizon and liquidity needs, possibly focusing on tax-efficient funds.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider tax implications of withdrawing from each account type to minimize taxes in retirement.
