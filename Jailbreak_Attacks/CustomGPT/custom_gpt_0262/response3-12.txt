I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Supplements**:
   - Some supplements (like milk thistle) are believed to support liver health, but consult a healthcare provider before use.

5. **Interventional Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy may be necessary to assess damage.

6. **Liver Transplant**:
   - In cases of advanced liver disease or failure, a transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
