Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### General Guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the maximum employer match; it's free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide based on your current tax bracket versus your projected future bracket. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide current tax deductions.
   - **Max Contributions:** Aim to maximize your annual contribution limits when feasible.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars and can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Investment Choices:** Invest in tax-efficient funds with lower turnover to minimize tax liabilities.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **Max Out 401(k) to Get Match**
   - Prioritize contributions to secure the employer match.

2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - If eligible, invest in a Roth or Traditional IRA, focusing on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**
   - Use these accounts for short-term goals or investments that provide liquidity.

### Monitor and Rebalance:
- Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to match your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Personalized advice can help tailor plans based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can optimize your savings and investment growth while minimizing taxes.
