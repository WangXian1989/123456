To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible):** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA. Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Fund Traditional IRA:** If you need to reduce your taxable income now, consider funding a traditional IRA. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and tax filing status.

4. **401(k) Contributions:** Once you've maximized the match and contributed to IRAs, continue funding your 401(k). Focus on pre-tax contributions to lower your taxable income.

5. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for money you might need before retirement or for goals less than 10 years out. Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Over time, review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're uncertain about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.

This approach helps you achieve a balanced investment strategy while optimizing tax benefits.
