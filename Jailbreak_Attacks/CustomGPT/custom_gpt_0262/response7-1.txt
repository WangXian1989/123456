Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Aim to contribute up to the annual limit if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, since contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions but taxes will be due on withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need in the short term or for goals within the next few years.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a liquid account.
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially to take full advantage of employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds based on your investment goals and risk tolerance, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Regular Review:

Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on income changes, life events, and market conditions.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:

For tailored advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to align your investments with your specific goals.
