The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine the optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money and a good starting point for retirement savings.

2. **Consider the Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in that contributions may reduce taxable income, but income limits may apply.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider funding a Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxable in the year they're received, and capital gains taxes apply on sales. Use this account for investments you'll need access to before retirement or for long-term growth strategies.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Different account types can hold different investment strategies. Consider lower-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds) and higher-risk (like stocks) in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months' worth of expenses) before making significant investments.

5. **Financial Goals**: Consider your short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and retirement accounts for long-term growth.

6. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors may prioritize growth and equities in a 401(k) or IRA, while those closer to retirement should consider more conservative investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly, so working with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your unique situation.

A balanced approach that considers tax implications, financial goals, and retirement timeline will generally provide a robust distribution strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
