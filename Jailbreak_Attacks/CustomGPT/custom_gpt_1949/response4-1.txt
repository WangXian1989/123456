To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current versus expected future tax rate when deciding.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains tax on any profits when you sell investments. Be mindful of dividend and interest taxes as well.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before directing more funds to other accounts, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Make Use of Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older).

4. **Balance Contributions**: 
   - Once youâ€™re maximizing your 401(k) match, consider putting money into your IRA for potentially lower-cost investment options and tax benefits.
   - After reaching your IRA limit, continue contributing to your 401(k) if possible and consider additional amounts for your taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk while aiming for growth.

6. **Review Your Financial Goals**:
   - Your asset distribution might depend on your personal financial goals, such as retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and other factors like saving for a home or children's education.

7. **Regular Revise Allocations**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, changing financial situations, and retirement timelines.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - It can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your funds while considering tax implications and financial goals, you can optimize your overall investment portfolio.
