Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially if your tax bracket is higher now than you expect it to be in retirement.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for more flexible investment options. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investing outside of retirement accounts. This can provide liquidity for short-term goals and can be more tax-efficient for long-term capital gains. Be mindful of the tax implications when investing in these accounts.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with the 401(k) contributions, especially to capture any company match.
- Max out an IRA if you're eligible (consider a Roth if you qualify).
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investment needs.

It might also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
