Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Below are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often features higher contribution limits and may include employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages as well, with traditional IRAs allowing pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are non-retirement investment accounts where you can withdraw funds without penalties. They may be subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - If you're focused on retirement, maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA is beneficial. If you plan to use the funds before retirement, a taxable account may be more appropriate.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to reduce taxable income.
   - Withdrawals from taxable accounts are only taxed on gains, while retirement accounts will be taxed upon withdrawal.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate investments across these accounts to balance risks. Consider more aggressive investments within tax-advantaged accounts and holding lower-risk investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Savings**: 
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid cash or a savings account for emergencies before investing heavily.

6. **Plan for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**:
   - Remember that traditional IRAs and 401(k)s require RMDs starting at age 73, which can affect your tax situation later in life.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By carefully considering these factors, you can establish a distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
