Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors. Here are some strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider which type (Traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest for flexibility and liquidity. You'll pay taxes on capital gains but can use tax-loss harvesting.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergency funds.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate based on your comfort with risk. Higher-risk investments may work well in long-term accounts, whereas more stable investments might be better for taxable accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA limits).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is balanced across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Max Out 401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then aim for the annual limit.
- **IRA Contributions**: Use a Roth IRA if you qualify for tax-free growth; otherwise, maximize a Traditional IRA.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for added flexibility.

### Review Regularly:
Reevaluate your strategy annually, especially after major life events, retirement fund changes, or shifts in financial goals. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
