To best distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions but tax you on withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that can benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates, such as stocks. You can also control when to realize gains.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - After securing the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth depending on your goals).
   - Then, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its maximum limit.

4. **Investment Choices**: Choose investments that may be tax-inefficient (like REITs or bonds) for your tax-advantaged accounts, and keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan to withdraw from accounts in a tax-efficient manner in retirement, often pulling from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred, and finally, tax-free sources.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Keep your asset allocation aligned with your goals by periodically rebalancing your accounts.

Consider your individual circumstances, including financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Consulting with a financial advisor can offer personalized insight.
