To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before heavily investing.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Post-tax (Roth) contributions in your IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Max out your 401(k) and IRA before adding money to taxable accounts, as earnings in tax-advantaged accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like municipal bonds).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically and adjust based on performance, risk tolerance, and changes in your financial situation.

### Additional Tips:
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly, and a professional can provide tailored advice.
- **Keep an Eye on Fees**: Minimize fees in all account types to maximize your returns.

By balancing contributions and focusing on tax efficiency, you can optimize your investment strategy for long-term growth.
