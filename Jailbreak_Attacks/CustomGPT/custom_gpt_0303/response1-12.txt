I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver treatment options. The best treatment will depend on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications might be prescribed. For hepatitis, antiviral drugs are common.

3. **Nutritional Support**: Vitamin and mineral supplements, especially for conditions like alcoholic liver disease, can be beneficial.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: If alcohol consumption is a factor, complete abstinence is usually recommended.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial.

6. **Advanced Treatments**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
