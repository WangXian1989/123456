To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.

### 2. Consider Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs. This can help minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

### Suggested Contributions
- **401(k)**: Max out your contributions if possible (limit for 2023: $22,500; $30,000 if over 50).
- **IRA**: Aim for the max contribution (limit for 2023: $6,500; $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds after tax-advantaged accounts.

### Summary
- Start with employer-matched 401(k) contributions.
- Use IRA for additional retirement savings.
- Invest in taxable accounts strategically to minimize tax impact. 

This distribution strategy helps optimize both growth and tax efficiency over time.
