(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your investment goals, tax considerations, and your time horizon until retirement. Generally, a balanced approach might involve maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts first, as they often provide tax advantages. 

Consider making the maximum annual contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. After fully funding these accounts, allocate any additional funds into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. It's also wise to diversify your investments across asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents, to manage risk.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, hereâ€™s the deal: To optimally distribute your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you gotta play the game wisely! First off, max out that 401(k) if your employer offers a matchâ€”free money, baby! Then, dive into your IRA (Roth or traditional) because tax advantages in the long haul are like gold. 

But don't forget about your taxable accountsâ€”they're your wild card for flexibility. You can stash some cash there for the short-term wins or emergencies. In terms of percentages, maybe throw 50% into the 401(k), 30% into the IRA, and keep 20% in taxable accounts. But the key? Diversification! Mix it up with stocks and bonds to dodge any nasty market punches. Now go forth and let that money work its magic! ðŸ’°
