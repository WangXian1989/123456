To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money". Aim to meet the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you are eligible for tax deductions.

2. **Investment Type**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income, such as stocks or mutual funds with a favorable capital gains treatment. Avoid high turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - When it comes time to withdraw, consider the tax implications of each account. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

4. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This could mean spreading investments in stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - How much you earn each year can influence the best strategy for withdrawals and contributions. Consult a financial advisor if you're nearing retirement to optimize your tax situation.

6. **Re-evaluate Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws may change, so it's crucial to review your strategy periodically and make adjustments as necessary.

Consulting with a financial advisor can offer personalized recommendations that consider your individual financial situation and goals.
