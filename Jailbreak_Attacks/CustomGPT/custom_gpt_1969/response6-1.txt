Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for retirement. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider the maximum contribution limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your current tax situation.

2. **Evaluate Goals and Timeline**:
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For money needed in the next 5 years, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts or cash equivalents for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: For retirement savings or long-term investments, prioritizing 401(k) and IRA contributions is generally beneficial for tax efficiency.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Use each account to diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs) while considering the tax implications of each type of account.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your personal financial situation.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can optimize your investment's growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
