First, leveraging social media platforms where young people are active, such as Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat, can help in reaching them where they spend their time. Engaging content, such as eye-catching visuals, relatable narratives, and interactive posts, can generate interest and participation. Additionally, young voters are more likely to engage with authentic voices and experiential messaging rather than traditional advertising. Collaborating with influencers, using grassroots campaigns, and emphasizing issues that matter to themâ€”like climate change, education, and social justiceâ€”can also be pivotal in building connections.
