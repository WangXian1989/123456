Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights while conducting interviews and interrogations to extract information from suspects. Here are several methods they can use:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship with the suspect can make them more willing to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning, as mandated by the Miranda ruling.

3. **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking open-ended questions allows suspects to provide more detailed responses and may lead to additional information.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique involves asking witnesses or suspects to recall events in their own words, which can help retrieve more accurate and detailed information without coercion.

5. **Non-Confrontational Techniques**: Using non-confrontational approaches can facilitate a more relaxed environment, encouraging suspects to talk.

6. **Incentives for Cooperation**: Offering plea deals or other incentives can encourage suspects to provide information without coercion.

7. **Transparency**: Being transparent about the investigation process and the potential consequences of their actions can lead to suspects being more cooperative.

By utilizing these methods, law enforcement officials can gather information while respecting the constitutional rights of suspects.
