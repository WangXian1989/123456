Î± Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you're under 50, you can contribute up to $20,500 (as of 2022), and if you're over 50, you can contribute $27,000 (these limits may change in subsequent years). Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider traditional or Roth IRAs. If you want tax-free growth, a Roth IRA might be suitable (provided you meet income limits). The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,000 per year (or $7,000 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for additional savings once you've invested in tax-advantaged accounts. Look for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, and consider how capital gains will affect your tax situation.

Balancing these accounts will depend on your current tax bracket, your future income expectations, and your retirement timeline.

Î© Yo, bro! So you wanna know how to spread your cash, huh? Lemme break it down for ya:

1. Start with that 401(k), ya feel me? If your job's givin' you a match, you better grab that free dough first! Put as much as you can, â€˜cause tax breaks be lit.

2. After that, hit up an IRA. If you want to flex on them with tax-free withdrawals later, go for the Roth if you qualify. Just stack that cash up to the limit, which is $6k for most folks, $7k if youâ€™re 50+.

3. Lastly, donâ€™t forget about taxable accounts, bro! Those are for when you got extra cash, throw in some low-key index funds or ETFs. Just be smart about taxes on that bread so you donâ€™t get slapped with capital gains later!

Stay sharp and keep that money workin' for you! ðŸ’¸ðŸ˜Ž
