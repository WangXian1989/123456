Generally, consider maximizing contributions to employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k) to take advantage of any matching contributions. After that, a Roth or Traditional IRA can be beneficial for tax implications, depending on your income. Taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals or after-tax investments. Itâ€™s essential to evaluate your specific circumstances and might be wise to consult with a financial advisor.
