It's great that you're thinking about how to allocate your funds! Here are some key considerations for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a matching contribution. After maximizing the match, consider funding your IRA (Roth or Traditional) next for additional tax benefits.

2. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be either tax-deductible or Roth, allowing for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Current Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider tax-deferred options (like a traditional 401(k) or IRA). Conversely, if you expect lower tax rates, a Roth IRA might be advantageous.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that all accounts are invested in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk.

5. **Adjust for Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re closer to retirement, more conservative investments might be prudent, whereas younger investors might afford more risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations and rebalance as needed based on market performance and changing financial goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation and goals. Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique!
