It's important to strategize when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of each account. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions reduce your taxable income, whereas taxes apply on withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals, so investing there can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk effectively.

4. **Emergency Funds**: Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before allocating excessive funds into these investment accounts.

5. **Consider Fees**: Be aware of the fees associated with each type of account and how that impacts your long-term growth.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy based on the types of accounts you have and your income needs in retirement to minimize taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation in each account periodically to align with your financial goals.
