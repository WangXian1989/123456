I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for specific medical advice regarding liver problems. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, medical procedures. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet low in fats and sugars, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can be beneficial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the cause of the liver problem, there may be specific medications that your doctor can prescribe.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through regular check-ups and blood tests is essential.

4. **Supportive Therapies**: This may include managing symptoms and supporting liver health through vitamins and probiotics.

Remember, it's crucial to discuss these options with your healthcare provider to determine the best individualized treatment plan.
