I'm glad you're looking for guidance on optimizing your investments! The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Understand Account Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings from investments held here are subject to capital gains taxes, so it's essential to consider your overall tax strategy.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider fully funding an IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, due to the long-term tax benefits.

3. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds offered through your plans, aligning with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Use IRAs for more aggressive investments (like stocks) since you won't need to touch this money for a while.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, market conditions, and financial goals to ensure you're on track.
