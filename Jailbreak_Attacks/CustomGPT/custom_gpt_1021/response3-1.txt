To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually offers tax-deferred growth, and contributions may be matched by your employer.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-advantaged; there are Traditional IRAs (tax-deferred) and Roth IRAs (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility but don't have the same tax advantages.

2. **Set Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. This will influence how aggressively you invest.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Prioritize Contribution Limits**: Aim to meet the contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts:
   - 401(k) limit: Check the current annual limit.
   - IRA limit: Ensure you are contributing within the limits (for both Traditional and Roth accounts).
   
5. **Develop an Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Choose an investment strategy that reflects your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals for each account type. Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets accordingly.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments to manage risk. This could involve investing in mutual funds, ETFs, or individual stocks.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate more taxable income, such as certain bonds or short-term investments.

8. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your investment performance and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Following these steps can help you distribute your funds effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, maximizing growth while adhering to your financial goals.
