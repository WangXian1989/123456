To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed as income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: With Roth IRAs, contributions are made after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed annually at your ordinary income tax rate, while capital gains are taxed only when realized.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to balance risk and return.

4. **Retirement Timing**: If you're closer to retirement, shift to more conservative investments in retirement accounts. In taxable accounts, consider holding onto investments longer to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Keep a portion of your savings in a liquid form outside of retirement accounts for emergencies.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your strategy to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation can provide personalized advice.

By balancing these factors, you can create an effective investment strategy that meets your long-term financial needs. Always review your plan regularly and adjust as necessary. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific area?
