To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out employer matches first.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) IRA based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts for easier access.
   - Long-term retirement planning can benefit from the tax advantages of 401(k)s and IRAs.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications on income.

4. **Tax Harvesting**:
   - Use taxable accounts to offset gains by selling investments at a loss to reduce tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to manage tax implications effectively.
