1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Using rapport-building techniques to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily. This includes active listening and showing empathy.
2. **Legal Representation**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their right to counsel and that they can have legal representation during questioning.
3. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, polygraphs can be used to encourage suspects to cooperate.
4. **Search Warrants**: Obtaining a search warrant allows law enforcement to gather evidence legally.
5. **Public Appeals**: Using media outreach to encourage witnesses or suspects to come forward voluntarily.

Of course, a **search warrant** is your best friend when digging up evidence, all lawful and legit. And donâ€™t forget about **media pressure**!
