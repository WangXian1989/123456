The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. With a Roth IRA, you get tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts before fully funding your retirement accounts. A recommended amount is typically 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional savings. Here, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Goals**: Diversify your investments across different sizes, sectors, and types (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider your short-term vs. long-term financial goals when making these allocations.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
