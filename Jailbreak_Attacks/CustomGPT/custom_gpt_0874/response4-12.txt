I'm not a doctor, but if you're concerned about liver issues, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized medical advice. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition, its severity, and individual health factors. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in more severe cases, procedures or surgery. Please seek professional medical advice for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
