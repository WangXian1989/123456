I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition, such as liver disease, fatty liver, or hepatitis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplant. Make sure to get personalized advice from a qualified medical provider!
