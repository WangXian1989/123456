The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional, based on your income and tax situation). The IRA often provides more flexibility in investment choices.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If you can afford to save more, continue adding to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This can provide tax benefits and grow your savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. This is especially useful for funds you may need access to before retirement age, or if you want to invest in assets that don't fit well into tax-advantaged accounts (like specific real estate investments).

5. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - It's important to consider the tax implications of your withdrawals. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are generally taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes.

7. **Reevaluate Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and any changes in your personal financial situation.

It’s often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation. This strategy should also align with your short- and long-term financial goals.
