To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Prioritize maximizing your contribution limit if your financial situation allows. Traditional 401(k)s provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth 401(k)s offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Invest in securities that are more tax-efficient (e.g., ETFs, index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Allocate enough to your **401(k)** to receive the employer match.
- Contribute to your **IRA** to take advantage of tax benefits based on your income level.
- Invest additional funds into **taxable accounts** for liquidity and potential tax-efficient growth.

### Suggested Next Steps:
- Evaluate your current income, investment goals, and retirement timeline to provide a tailored approach.
- Consult with a financial advisor to align your strategies with market conditions and personal circumstances.
