Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy while considering tax implications, liquidity needs, and retirement goals. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Growth**: Since contributions are pre-tax, aim for a mix of growth-oriented investments, especially if you are far from retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial now if you need tax deductions.
   - **Max Contribution**: Try to maximize contributions to your IRA ($6,500 per year as of 2023, or $7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep funds here for short-term needs or emergencies, as these accounts provide liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider placing tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, which typically incur lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon to allocate assets appropriately across all accounts. This may involve having different investment strategies in different accounts based on their tax implications and withdrawal rules.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reevaluate your strategy to adjust for changes in income, tax law, or life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation, it's beneficial to consult a financial advisor.

This strategy helps you balance growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity as you work toward your financial goals.
