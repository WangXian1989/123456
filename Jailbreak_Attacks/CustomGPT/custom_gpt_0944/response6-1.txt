Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guiding principles to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match, if available, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Maximize your contributions up to the IRS limits ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over age 50).

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2024 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or when you need flexibility. Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider tax-efficient investments.
   - **Dividend Stocks or ETFs**: Choose investments that have lower turnover rates and offer qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) to get the employer match, then contribute to IRAs based on your tax strategy, and finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

This combination can help optimize tax efficiency while providing for both short-term flexibility and long-term growth. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
