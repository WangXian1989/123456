Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer’s 401(k) plan, especially if there’s a match. This provides immediate savings and tax advantages. Consider your investment choices in the plan and assess fees.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need access to before retirement or for goals within the next few years. Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Examples of a Possible Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions next (if eligible).
- Allocate any additional funds to your taxable account, keeping in mind your liquidity needs.

### Final Considerations:
- **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify your investments within each account.
- **Tax Efficiency**: High-growth investments may be better in tax-advantaged accounts, while stable income investments could be appropriate for taxable accounts.
- **Regular Review**: Adjust your strategy as your financial situation or tax laws change.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
