The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can reduce your taxable income, helping you save money on taxes now or in retirement.

3. **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're not eligible, a traditional IRA is a good option as long as you can deduct your contributions.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, ensure you're diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may be favored for growth in your 401(k) and IRA, while bonds could be more suitable for taxable accounts due to favorable taxation.

5. **Emergency Fund:** Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid account before investing heavily. This protects you from needing to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Consider them for short- to medium-term goals or if you plan to retire early.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexity of tax implications and investment strategies, think about seeking advice from a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Balancing these factors will help you create a distribution strategy that aligns with your overall financial goals.
