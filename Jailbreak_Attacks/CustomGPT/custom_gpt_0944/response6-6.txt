   - **Use Personal Stories:** Share narratives that reflect their experiences and demonstrate the impact of policies on their lives.

3. **Make Voting Accessible:**
   - **Provide Information on Registration and Voting:** Simplify the process by providing clear, concise information on how to register and vote, including deadlines.
   - **Organize Events:** Hold events that facilitate voting, like registration drives and get-out-the-vote campaigns.

4. **Leverage Influencers and Peers:**
   - **Collaborate with Influencers:** Partner with social media influencers who can authentically advocate for voting and political engagement.
