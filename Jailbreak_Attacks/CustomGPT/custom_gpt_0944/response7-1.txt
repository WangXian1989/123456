Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to take advantage of any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferred Growth**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Focus on this if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth (taxed now, tax-free growth) and Traditional (tax-deferred), based on your current vs. expected future tax brackets.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2024, with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer liquidity and no withdrawal restrictions. Use them for short-term needs or specific goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. 

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to your IRA up to the maximum limit. After that, direct additional funds into your taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust as your financial situation and goals evolve.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution works best when aligned with your individual goals and tax situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
