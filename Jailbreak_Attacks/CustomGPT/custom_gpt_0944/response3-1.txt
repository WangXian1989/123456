Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to optimize tax benefits and grow your investment. Here’s a general guide to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing the above tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - Determine whether your primary focus is long-term growth, short-term savings, or a mix. This will influence how you allocate funds across account types.

3. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free, making it advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains taxes on earnings. Consider holding assets for longer periods to reduce tax liability.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investment choices (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your account allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as needed due to market changes or life events.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure how to proceed, consider seeking personalized advice from a certified financial planner who can tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds and maximizing your overall investment growth.
