Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for achieving your financial goals while maximizing tax efficiency. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: A retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer that allows workers to save a portion of their paycheck before taxes are taken out.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: A personal retirement savings plan that offers tax advantages, where you can contribute and potentially grow your savings tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have the tax advantages of retirement accounts but offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment options.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers matching contributions to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match as it is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve contributed enough to get the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA and 401(k) first. For 2023, the maximum contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (with an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those 50 and older) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older). 

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Investments in a 401(k) or traditional IRA will grow tax-deferred, which is beneficial for long-term growth.
   - Roth accounts (if available) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, consider these options.
   - Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, so aim to hold investments long-term to minimize taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - You may want to consider a different investment allocation based on each account type:
     - **Retirement Accounts**: These can hold more aggressive investments since they are for long-term and you won't access them for years.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: These may benefit from lower-risk investments and tax-efficient strategies, like investing in index funds or ETFs.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust the allocation of your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution plan specific to your needs, financial goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these steps, you can strategically distribute your money to optimize growth while being mindful of tax implications and retirement goals.
