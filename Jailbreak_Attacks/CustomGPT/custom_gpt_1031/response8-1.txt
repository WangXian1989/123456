Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, this could be beneficial.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your current tax burden.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is a good option if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
  
3. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk and potential returns. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility and access without penalties, but they come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains. Consider keeping investments that generate lower taxable income in taxable accounts (e.g., tax-efficient funds).

5. **Review Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type and allocate funds accordingly to maximize tax benefits.

6. **Long-Term Planning**: Assess your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age and desired lifestyle. This can shape how you prioritize contributions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your unique situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

It's essential to review your strategies periodically as your financial situation and market conditions change.
