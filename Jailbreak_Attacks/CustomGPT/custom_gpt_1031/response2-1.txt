When considering how to best distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, this can be a good option.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in tax treatment if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t provide immediate tax benefits, but they offer flexibility with withdrawals and may have capital gains tax advantages when holding investments for the long term.

3. **Allocate Based on Time Horizon**:
   - For short-term goals (like buying a house in 5 years), consider using taxable accounts where you can access funds more readily.
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize 401(k) and IRAs, focusing on growth investments that are suitable for a longer time horizon.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type. This helps manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. You might want to have a strategy for when to tap into each account type to minimize taxes over time.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and tax laws can change, so regularly review your allocation and adjust as needed.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and objectives.
