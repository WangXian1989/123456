Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. If possible, aim to max out contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your eligibility.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need sooner, as they offer more liquidity. They can also be beneficial for holding investments that generate qualified dividends or capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Favor growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold interest-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts to avoid taxation until withdrawal.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Diversify your investments appropriately.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your income, expenses, and investment performance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Tailored advice can be invaluable, especially for optimizing tax implications and achieving your specific goals.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient distribution strategy.
