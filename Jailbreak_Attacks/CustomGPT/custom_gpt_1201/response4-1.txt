Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)** to maximize the employer match.
- **Next, prioritize an IRA** to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Invest in taxable accounts** for flexibility and access to funds.

### Final Tips:
- Consider your current and expected future tax brackets.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
