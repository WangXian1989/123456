1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Focus on a balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and sodium.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or other specific therapies.

3. **Supplements**: 
   - Certain vitamins and minerals may support liver health, but consult your doctor first.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver recovery.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

Always prioritize a discussion with your healthcare provider for tailored advice and treatment options.
