Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts efficiently depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Fees**: Evaluate the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k). If options are limited or expensive, prioritize other accounts.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rate.
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to max out contributions if possible. For 2024, this is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use this for investment flexibility—it's not bound by contribution limits, and you can withdraw funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs, preferably those with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy Summary:
- **Short-Term Needs**: Prioritize taxable accounts for accessibility.
- **Medium to Long-Term**: Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages and compounding growth.
- **Balance Growth and Risk**: Consider your asset allocation strategy across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's advisable to regularly review your allocation and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
