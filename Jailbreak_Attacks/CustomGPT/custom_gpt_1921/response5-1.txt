The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider increasing contributions to the maximum limit if you can afford it.

2. **Prioritize IRAs:**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Traditional IRAs are also beneficial for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or for investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals, especially from taxable accounts.
   - Consider your tax bracket when planning withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
