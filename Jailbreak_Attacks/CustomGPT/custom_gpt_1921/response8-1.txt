Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) if you qualify, as these offer tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like long-term capital gains) or for funds you'll need in the short term.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all account types. This can include stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your allocations and adjust based on market performance or changes in your financial situation.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have liquidity. Consider keeping some cash in taxable accounts for emergencies and short-term needs.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your salary (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: Up to the annual contribution limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023)
- **Taxable Account**: Remainder after maxing out tax-advantaged options

### Consult a Professional
It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances.
