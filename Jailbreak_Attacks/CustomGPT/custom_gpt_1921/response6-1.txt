Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth potential, tax efficiency, and liquidity. Here’s a recommended approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
- **IRA:** Consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Evaluate Investment Strategy
- **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks or equity funds, as these accounts have tax advantages that allow for compounding.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or interest; consider tax-efficient ETFs or index funds.

### 3. Maintain Liquidity Needs
- **Taxable Accounts:** Keep a portion for short-term needs or emergencies, ensuring easy access to funds without penalties.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust Regularly
- Periodically review your asset allocation based on your changing risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored retirement accounts and IRAs.
- Balance growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and keep liquid funds in taxable accounts.
- Regularly reassess your financial strategy to align with changing circumstances. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual situation.
