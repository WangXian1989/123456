1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may include:
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to reduce inflammation or treat specific liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Complete abstinence from alcohol to prevent further liver damage.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.
