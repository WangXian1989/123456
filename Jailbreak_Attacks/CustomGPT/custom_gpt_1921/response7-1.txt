Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several factors. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-deferred; traditional IRAs are tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money is invested after-tax, and capital gains are taxed when realized.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
   - **Fund IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, taking advantage of tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize these for income-generating investments (like bonds) to minimize tax liabilities.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that produce lower capital gains and tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### 4. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and maintain 401(k) and IRA for retirement.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Balance your investments according to your comfort with risk across all accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly check your allocations and rebalance as needed based on performance and life changes.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% salary (maxing out if possible)
- **IRA**: Max allowable contributions (currently $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Account**: Remainder after optimal contributions to above accounts.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your financial situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
