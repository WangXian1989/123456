The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.” Consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket since contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility (income limits for tax-deductible contributions), consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax deduction benefits, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. It may make sense to keep investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding stocks (which may not pay dividends or have favorable long-term capital gains treatment) in taxable accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account separate from your investment accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to spread risk. Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in each account based on your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Your Timeline**:
   - The time horizon for your goals will affect your asset allocation. If you’re investing for a long-term goal (like retirement), you might choose a more aggressive allocation in stocks. For short-term goals, consider more conservative investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy as markets fluctuate.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity and personalized nature of investment strategies, consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice that reflects your specific financial situation.

Remember, the optimal distribution can vary greatly from one individual to another, so it’s crucial to assess your unique circumstances.
