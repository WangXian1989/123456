Itâ€™s important to consider a few key factors when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). IRAs often provide a broader selection of investments compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Continue Contributions to Your 401(k):** Once you've funded your IRA, you can continue to max out your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency:** Taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals or emergencies. Try to hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from capital gains tax rates.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments in each account are well diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Remember, everyoneâ€™s financial situation is unique, and it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
