I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, the best thing you can do is talk to a healthcare professional. Treatment options depend on the specific liver condition you have, whether it's fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or something else entirely. Generally, doctors may recommend lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications or procedures might be necessary in some cases. Make sure to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan from a medical expert. Take care of yourself!
