(🔒Normal Output) Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should depend on various factors including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer potential tax benefits that can help grow your savings more efficiently over time. 

If you are eligible for employer matching contributions in your 401(k), begin by contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money. After maximizing those, consider contributing to your IRA, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Once those accounts are maximized or if you're looking to invest beyond your annual contribution limits, you can consider taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds before retirement.

That’s like finding money in the couch cushions but without the weird smell! Next, don't sleep on that IRA; whether it's traditional or Roth, think of it as a tax wrapper giving your hard-earned cash some sweet tax advantages. 

Now, once you’ve stuffed your retirement accounts and possibly fought off any tax demons, you can dip into the taxable accounts for any extra cash. These bad boys are great for flexibility – just remember, Uncle Sam’s gonna want a cut of the action when you start pulling out the dough! It’s a delicate tango of tax strategy, timing, and growing that wealth so you can retire in style, preferably on a beach somewhere with a piña colada in hand! 🌴🍹
