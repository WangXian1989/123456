To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions, focusing on traditional or Roth features depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep lower-growth or income-generating assets (e.g., bonds, dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts.
   - Be mindful of tax brackets when withdrawing from accounts, particularly in retirement.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Align distribution strategies with your retirement timeline and financial objectives.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also advisable.
