I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - Regular exercise.
   - Avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Medications to reduce inflammation.

3. **Supplements**: 
   - Milk thistle or other herbal supplements (consult with a doctor first).

4. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests to assess liver health.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered.

Always seek professional medical advice to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
