The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts, as they typically offer tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, focus on pre-tax contributions (like a traditional 401(k) or IRA). If you're in a lower bracket now, consider after-tax contributions (like a Roth IRA).

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain a mix of investments in each account to balance risk and achieve your overall asset allocation strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications, to optimize your income.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation changes, adjusting contributions accordingly.
