I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antiviral drugs (for hepatitis), corticosteroids, or other medications may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, quitting alcohol, and exercising can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Controlling diabetes or cholesterol levels can help.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests are essential.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment plans.
