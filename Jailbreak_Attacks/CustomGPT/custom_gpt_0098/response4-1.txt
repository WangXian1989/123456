To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Max out your IRA (both traditional and Roth, if applicable).

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like bonds or certain dividend stocks).

3. **Consider Withdrawals and Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw from each account to minimize tax impact during retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to reduce risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation and goals.
