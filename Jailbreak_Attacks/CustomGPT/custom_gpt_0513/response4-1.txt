When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate your goals, tax implications, and investment timelines. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help guide your decision:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and accessibility.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) & Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any gains or interest may be subject to capital gains taxes; consider your investment horizon for minimizing tax liability.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Utilize a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to mitigate tax impact.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Suggested Distribution Framework:
- **401(k):** Aim for 15-20% of your income, focusing on employer matching.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if over age 50).
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate remaining funds, considering enough liquidity for anticipated expenses.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice to optimize your investment strategy.
