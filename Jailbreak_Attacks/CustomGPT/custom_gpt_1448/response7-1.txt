Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for achieving your financial goals. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: Typically, if your employer offers a matching contribution, it’s wise to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limits are higher than IRAs, making it a great way to save for retirement with tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider whether a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is more beneficial. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If eligible, maximize contributions to your IRA after meeting the employer match in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investment flexibility and access to funds without penalties. Consider placing more tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds here, as they generally incur lower taxes on capital gains and dividends compared to other investment types.

**General Strategy**: A common approach is to prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then focus on maxing out your IRA, and finally, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. Depending on your tax bracket and investment goals, you might also want to consider the tax implications of your investment strategies in taxable accounts.

It's important to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
