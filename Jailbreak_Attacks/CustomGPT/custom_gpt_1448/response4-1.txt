Determining the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match before contributing to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributing to your 401(k) can reduce your taxable income for the year, which can be especially beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket. Note that contributions are pre-tax for traditional 401(k)s.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. A Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free distributions in retirement.

3. **Consider Investment Choices**: Look at the investment options available in your 401(k). If they have high fees or limited choices, it might be better to contribute more to your IRA or taxable accounts where you can choose better-performing investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can then consider putting money into taxable accounts. They offer greater flexibility for withdrawals and investments, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider how you allocate your investments across these accounts. Generally, you may want to keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks and index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Long-Term Goals and Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your overall financial goals (retirement, buying a house, etc.) and tailor your contributions accordingly. Also, developing a strategy for when you will access funds can influence your distribution approach.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Review your allocation regularly and adjust based on changes in the market, your income level, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation may be beneficial as well. Remember, these strategies may vary based on individual circumstances and goals.
