To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum allowable contribution if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider this for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax liability. Investing in index funds or ETFs can be beneficial here because they typically have lower turnover resulting in fewer taxable events.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Allocate growth-oriented investments to tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Place bonds and income-generating assets in taxable accounts if they produce lower tax rates on dividends and interest.

4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

5. **Regular Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and your personal financial goals.

By establishing a clear strategy focusing on maximizing tax efficiency and diversifying investments, you can create a well-rounded and effective distribution of your money among these accounts. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
