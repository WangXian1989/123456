When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your retirement savings and investment growth:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) plan offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and should be your initial priority.

2. **Understand Tax Advantage**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
     - *Traditional IRA*: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and the account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
     - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
  
3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Each account has specific contribution limits (for example, in 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500, and the IRA limit is $6,500). Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.

4. **Diversify Investments**: In taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. In retirement accounts, you can take advantage of more aggressive investment strategies since tax implications are deferred or eliminated.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about how and when you will withdraw funds. Having a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts allows for more flexibility in managing your tax burden during retirement.

6. **Review Your Goals and Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your asset allocation based on your individual financial goals, investment timeline, and risk tolerance.

7. **Regularly Review Your Plan**: Life changes, market conditions, and tax laws can affect your strategy, so review your allocations periodically and adjust as necessary.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that matches your financial situation and future goals. Keep in mind that investing involves risks and it's important to do thorough research and consider seeking professional advice.
