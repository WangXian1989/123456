Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing any matching contributions, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: This account allows for higher contribution limits and, in many cases, offers pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax), especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds to a taxable account after maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts can provide flexibility and access without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: If you are younger and have a long time until retirement, you may want to take on more risk with investments in your taxable accounts versus your retirement accounts, which often have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Reviewing Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Diversify across asset classes in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Periodic Assessment**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.

It is advisable to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation for a well-rounded approach.
