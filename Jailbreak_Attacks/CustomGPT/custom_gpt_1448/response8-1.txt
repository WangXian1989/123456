When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are pre-tax, meaning you won't pay taxes on that income until you withdraw it in retirement. If you have a high employer match, maximize your contributions here first to take full advantage of that.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow for tax-deferred growth. If you qualify, consider if a Roth IRA would be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess your current tax rate versus your expected rate in retirement to make this decision.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not receive the same tax advantages, but are more flexible in terms of access to funds and diversification. They are subject to capital gains tax when you sell.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your account types with your investment goals. For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts where you can access the funds without penalties.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Different accounts may have different tax treatments, so it can be beneficial to hold different types of investments in each.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type and the tax implications of exceeding those limits. For example, ensure you are contributing to your employer's 401(k) to at least receive any matching contributions.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Consider how and when you will need to access these funds. 401(k) and IRA funds can incur penalties for early withdrawal (before age 59Â½), while funds in a taxable account can be accessed more freely.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to ensure they are aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, the best strategy can vary based on individual circumstances, including current income, expected retirement income, taxation, and personal financial goals. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized distribution strategy.
