Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some steps and considerations to help you decide on the best allocation:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions or earnings until you withdraw funds. Employer matching contributions can significantly enhance your savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, with tax-deferred growth. Taxes apply upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax in the year you sell assets.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - If your income allows, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).

### 3. **Consider Your Income Level:**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth account might be more beneficial.
   - Conversely, if you believe your income will decrease significantly, traditional accounts may offer immediate tax benefits.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and opportunity for growth.
   - Keep in mind that different accounts could hold different types of investments for tax efficiency (e.g., high-growth assets in Roth accounts to benefit from tax-free growth).

### 5. **Withdrawals and Timing:**
   - Plan for the timing of your withdrawals, as this can impact your tax situation. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility without penalty for withdrawal if needed before retirement age.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on performance, changing goals, or market conditions.

### Example Strategy:
- Max out your 401(k) contribution (up to employer match).
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, or a Traditional IRA if you’re eligible for deductions.
- Invest remaining funds in a diversified mix in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion:
Your ideal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
