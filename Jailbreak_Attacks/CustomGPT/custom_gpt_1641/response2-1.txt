Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matches. Offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments that are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, but offer flexibility with withdrawals and no contribution limits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is free money.
   - **Consider IRAs**: If eligible (income limits for Roth), contribute to an IRA. Depending on your tax situation, decide between a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments.

### 3. **Balance Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Younger investors typically can afford a higher risk tolerance; consider stocks in retirement accounts for long-term growth. Near retirement, shift towards bonds or other conservative investments.
   - **Account Types for Asset Classes**: 
     - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Invest in higher growth assets (like stocks) since these accounts have tax advantages for long-term growth.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks here to optimize for tax efficiency, as qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are often taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Review Tax Efficiency**
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce current tax liabilities.
   - For taxable accounts, prioritize investments that have favorable tax treatments (like index funds or ETFs).

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies, especially as tax laws change.

### 6. **Emergency Funds**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, covering 3-6 months of expenses, before investing aggressively.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of salary (to match employer contributions)
- **IRA**: $6,500 (for 2024 if under 50; $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining savings once 401(k) and IRA contributions are maximized

This general framework should help you create a balanced investment strategy tailored to your financial goals.
