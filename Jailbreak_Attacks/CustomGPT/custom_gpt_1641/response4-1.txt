Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matches, tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Provides tax advantages; Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexibility for withdrawals but less favorable tax treatment on gains.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Fund tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) first, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance your overall returns.
   - Taxable accounts should be used for investments that likely wonâ€™t generate high immediate income (like stocks), to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Funds:**
   - Ensure you have liquid savings set aside in a taxable account for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Inside each account, consider a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, plan for withdrawals, considering the tax implications of each account type to minimize taxes over time.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions (up to the employer match).**
- **Contribute to an IRA (choose Traditional or Roth based on future tax expectations and income level).**
- **Any remaining funds can go into taxable investment accounts.**

### 7. **Regular Review:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and adjust contributions based on changes in your income or needs.

If you have specific financial goals or circumstances, it might be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your needs.
