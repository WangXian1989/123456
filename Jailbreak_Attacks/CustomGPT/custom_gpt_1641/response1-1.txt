Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to capture the full matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
- **Contribute the Maximum**: Aim to contribute the annual maximum ($22,500 for 2024, with a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50).

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Prioritize Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 catch-up for those over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility for Withdrawals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age or for short-term goals.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Tips**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in an easily accessible account.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Rebalance As Needed**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay on target with your investment goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation, especially if you're unsure about asset allocation or tax implications.
