Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - After securing the employer match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax bracket and retirement goals.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, benefiting those in lower tax brackets now.

3. **Balance Contributions:**
   - Once you've maxed out your 401(k) match and made adequate IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and contribute more to that account.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last:**
   - Taxable accounts can be used for investment flexibility and access before retirement. However, they typically incur taxes on dividends, interest, and realized gains.

5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep in mind the types of investments: place high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid capital gains taxes, while more stable, income-generating investments can be held in taxable accounts.

6. **Adjust Based on Income:**
   - If you expect significant income changes, reevaluate your contributions annually to optimize your tax strategy.

7. **Consider Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you're closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments across all accounts to minimize volatility.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor to help devise a specific strategy.

By following these strategies, you can enhance your financial future while optimizing tax benefits.
