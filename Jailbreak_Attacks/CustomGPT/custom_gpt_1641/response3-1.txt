Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here. Consider maxing out contributions to take full advantage of the match.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth is preferable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for any extra savings after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts. Investments here should focus on long-term growth, employing strategies like tax-loss harvesting to manage your tax liabilities.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations in line with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

By following this strategy, you can effectively manage your investments while considering tax implications and retirement needs.
