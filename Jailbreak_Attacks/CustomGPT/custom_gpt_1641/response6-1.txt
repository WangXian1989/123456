To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k), but Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for funds you'll need before retirement, offering flexibility but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Equities vs. Bonds**: Allocate funds based on risk tolerance; equities are generally better suited for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might fit better in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations annually or bi-annually to maintain your desired risk profile and adapt to market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Contribute 15% of salary to 401(k) until employer match is maxed.**
- **Contribute $6,500 to Roth IRA (or traditional IRA based on tax bracket).**
- **Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).**

### Final Tips
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor the strategy to your personal financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach will help maximize growth while efficiently managing taxes.
