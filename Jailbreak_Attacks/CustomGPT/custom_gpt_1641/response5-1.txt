(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, particularly since it's essentially free money. Maximize your contributions if you can, as contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to either a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current versus expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. This is useful for flexibility and accessibility, although you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Consider asset allocation strategies, such as a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments that align with your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down like a true financial wizard!

1. **401(k):** First off, if your employer is throwing in free cash with a match, snag that! Take advantage of it like itâ€™s your favorite snack. You want to hit the max contribution limit if possible, but at least get that full match. Itâ€™s like a no-brainer.

2. **IRA:** Now, swinging over to IRAsâ€”this is where it gets spicy. If you're young-ish and expecting a higher income later, you might wanna lean toward a Roth IRA. Why? Because tax-free money sounds sweet when youâ€™re older. If you're closer to retirement or in a high tax bracket now, go for that Traditional IRA for the immediate tax deduction. 

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After youâ€™ve milked those tax-advantaged accounts dry, itâ€™s time to hit up your taxable accounts. These give you the freedom to invest however you like, but remember: Uncle Sam loves his cut of dividends and capital gains, so plan accordingly.

4. **Diversification:** Make sure to diversify! Donâ€™t throw all your eggs in one basket; mix it up with stocks, bonds, maybe even some real estate REITs if youâ€™re feeling adventurous. Aim for a balance that makes sense for your risk appetite and goals.

And hey, if all this feels overwhelming, definitely chat with a financial advisor. They can help you map it all out so you donâ€™t lose your mind!
