To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess the performance of your investments and adjust as necessary.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer-term investments can be more aggressively allocated in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term needs may be better suited for taxable accounts.

By strategically distributing your investments and regularly reviewing your financial goals, you can optimize your portfolio for both growth and tax efficiency.
