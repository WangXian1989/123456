I'm here to help you with meta-analysis and systematic reviews, rather than providing financial advice. However, I can suggest that when considering distribution among different investment accounts, individuals often analyze their overall investment goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies. If you have questions related to conducting a meta-analysis or systematic review on financial behaviors or investment strategies, feel free to ask!
