I'm sorry to hear that you're having liver problems. It's important to discuss your condition with a healthcare professional who can provide tailored advice and treatment options based on your specific situation. Treatment for liver problems can vary widely depending on the underlying cause (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Common treatment options can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, liver transplantation. Please consult a doctor for the most appropriate treatment for your liver health.
