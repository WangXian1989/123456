Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to capture the full match. This is essentially free money.
   
2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, which can lower your taxable income in the short term and grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income or for short-term goals, where you might need flexibility.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Ensure that your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes in each type of account. This could mean holding stocks, bonds, and other assets in a way that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

4. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider when and how you’ll withdraw funds. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA can be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

5. **Rebalance Accordingly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure that you maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for market changes.

By considering these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth and minimizes taxes over time. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these principles to your individual circumstances.
