Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, contribute to either your 401(k) or an IRA. If you have a traditional 401(k) or IRA, you'll get a tax deduction on contributions, which can lower your taxable income. If you prefer tax-free growth, consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Depending on your income, you might want to prioritize either pre-tax contributions (traditional accounts) or post-tax contributions (Roth accounts). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts may be advantageous.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you’re diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks, bonds, and other asset classes can be allocated differently across accounts.

5. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts but still want to invest, consider taxable accounts. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals but will incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations across all accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice to tailor your strategy to your specific situation. 

This plan can help you make the most out of each type of account while optimizing your tax situation for the long term.
