The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year you contribute. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize your 401(k) contributions.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA:** If you qualify based on income limits, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs; as of 2023, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in taxable accounts. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies that minimize taxable events.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across your accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, while more stable investments can be placed in taxable accounts.

5. **Ongoing Review:**
   - Regularly assess your investment distribution based on changes in your goals, tax laws, and market conditions. It may be beneficial to rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, as they can provide tailored strategies to effectively distribute your investments.

By strategically distributing your money among these accounts considering the above factors, you can enhance your growth potential while managing your tax implications efficiently.
