The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize employer match in your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax advantages for contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts can help you grow your investment without being taxed annually on capital gains or interest income.

4. **Diversify your investments**: Within your accounts, aim for a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Use taxable accounts for short-term goals**: If you have short-term financial goals (e.g., buying a house, funding education), consider putting money in taxable accounts where you can easily access it without penalties.

6. **Consider tax implications**: Be mindful of how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. For example, withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free.

7. **Review and adjust regularly**: Your financial situation can change, so itâ€™s essential to review your distribution strategy regularly and adjust as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a distribution strategy to your unique situation.
