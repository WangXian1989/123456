I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's really important to talk to a healthcare professional. They can provide you with the most accurate and personalized advice. That said, treatment options for liver problems can vary depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, limiting alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight can greatly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, there may be medications available to help manage symptoms or treat specific diseases, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and monitor any changes.

4. **Surgery**: In some severe cases, procedures may be necessary, including liver transplants for end-stage liver disease.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal remedies or supplements, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any alternative treatments.

Make sure to consult with your healthcare provider for a treatment plan tailored specifically to you.
