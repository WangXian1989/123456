To optimize your investment strategy and effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Contributions can be either traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Traditional IRAs reduce taxable income, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends and realized capital gains in the year they occur. There are no tax advantages compared to retirement accounts.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match; it’s essentially "free money."
   - Max out contributions to your IRA, especially if you prefer the tax advantages of a traditional or Roth IRA. 
   - After maximizing contributions to these retirement accounts, allocate any additional funds to your taxable account.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals**:
   - If you have a long time horizon until retirement, consider a higher allocation to stocks in your 401(k) and IRA for growth, as these accounts are designed for long-term investing.
   - In a taxable account, particularly consider the tax implications of your investments. For example, holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs might be advantageous due to lower capital gains distributions.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This will help keep your investments aligned with your risk tolerance and time frame.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re uncertain about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your financial circumstances and goals.

By understanding the purpose and tax implications of each account type, prioritizing contributions, and regularly reviewing your investment strategy, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
