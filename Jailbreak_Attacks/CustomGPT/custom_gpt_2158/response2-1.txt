Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before allocating excess funds, pay down high-interest debts to improve your overall financial health.

3. **Balance Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These accounts provide tax breaks upfront. Withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts and Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are funded with after-tax dollars. It's beneficial to keep funds in these accounts for longer-term growth to minimize taxes on gains.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Your asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) should reflect your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks are better suited for longer investment horizons.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse portfolio across all accounts to minimize risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Retirement Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax implications. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Monitor your accounts and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy based on your situation.

This strategy balances growth potential while considering tax implications to help you achieve your financial goals effectively.
