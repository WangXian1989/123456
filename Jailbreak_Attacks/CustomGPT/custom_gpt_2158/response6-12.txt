I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Avoid alcohol consumption.
   - Maintain a healthy weight with diet and exercise.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), medications might be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be options.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
