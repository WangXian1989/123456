I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition, but common approaches may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can be crucial.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests can help track liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures or transplantation may be necessary.

Please reach out to a healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment recommendations tailored to your situation.
