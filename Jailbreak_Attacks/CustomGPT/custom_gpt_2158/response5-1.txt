(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a balanced approach might include:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, which is essentially free money.
2. **IRA:** Max out your contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, ideal for younger investors expecting higher tax rates in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts, or for savings you might need access to before retirement. 

Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! Distributing your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about strategy and what you plan to do with your money. Hereâ€™s a killer way to approach it:

1. **Max Out Your 401(k):** First up, get that employer match if you have oneâ€”itâ€™s like getting free money! Aim to contribute the max allowable if you can swing it.
   
2. **Dabble in IRAs:** Next, pour more into a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. The tax-free growth? Chef's kiss! You want that sweet, sweet compounding.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:** Once youâ€™ve hit the caps on tax-advantaged accounts, throw some cash into taxable accounts. They're great for liquidity and let you play with different investment strategies without the withdrawal penalties looming over you.
