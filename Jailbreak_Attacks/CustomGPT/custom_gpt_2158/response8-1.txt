Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first. Contribute enough to get any available match as it's essentially "free money."

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your tax bracket and future income expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This can also be beneficial for short-term goals, as these funds are more accessible without penalties.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a liquid account first.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Keep investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider placing stocks or low-turnover funds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Long-Term Goals**: If saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to optimize growth. 

### Regular Review: 
Annually review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on changes in your goals or financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
