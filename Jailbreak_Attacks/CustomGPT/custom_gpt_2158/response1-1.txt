Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing enough to take full advantage of any tax deferral benefits.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA might be beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investment flexibility and accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Order of Priority:
1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**
2. **Contribute to IRA (Roth or traditional)**
3. **Max out 401(k) contributions**
4. **Invest in taxable accounts**

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside before investing heavily.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes to manage risk.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation is also a good idea!
