I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems that are commonly recommended. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and limit processed foods.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or tackle the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progression of the condition.

4. **Weight Management**: If overweight, losing weight can significantly improve liver health, especially in cases of fatty liver disease.

5. **Vaccinations**: Vaccines for hepatitis A and B may be recommended, depending on your risk factors.

6. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to environmental toxins and chemicals can help protect liver health.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
