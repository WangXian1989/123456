Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Once you meet the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If you can, also contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often provide more investment options and flexibility.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on earnings and withdrawals. Use these accounts for investments that generate lower interest income, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth. 
   - Consider holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to offset taxes with interest payments.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on market performance, tax changes, and life stages.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
