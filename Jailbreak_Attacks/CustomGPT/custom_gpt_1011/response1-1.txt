Distributing your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your employer match, continue to contribute to your 401(k). This may offer higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've taken advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are useful for investments and savings outside of retirement or for short-term goals.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts can help minimize taxes.

6. **Diversification**: Across all accounts, ensure you're diversifying your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
