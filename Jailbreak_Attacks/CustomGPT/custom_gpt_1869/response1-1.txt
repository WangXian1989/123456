Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This works well if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you need tax deductions now, a traditional IRA might be beneficial. Contributions can be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties—great for short- to mid-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments with lower turnover to minimize tax impact.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Age-Based Allocation**: Younger investors might favor equities, while older investors may want a more conservative mix.
- **Diversification**: Keep a balanced investment strategy across all accounts.
  
### Consult a Professional:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance that considers your specific situation and goals. They can help tailor a strategy that best suits your needs.
