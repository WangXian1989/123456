Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider these priorities:
   - **401(k)**: If it has good investment options and low fees, consider contributing the maximum limit (up to $22,500 for 2024, plus catch-up contributions if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, consider a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The limit for IRAs in 2024 is $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility since you can access funds without penalties or specific timelines.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Choose a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, place more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
