Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Traditional accounts allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contributing to these first can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes on investments. You might consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains (like index funds) or for short-term goals.

3. **Account Priorities**:
   - Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before heavily investing in taxable accounts.
   - Consider the type of investments: keep bonds and high-yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts and place lower-yield investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. Each account type can hold a variety of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance your overall portfolio risk.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement, you may want to be more conservative in your asset allocation and shift to more stable investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy based on your specific situation, including risk tolerance and retirement goals.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial situation and market conditions.
