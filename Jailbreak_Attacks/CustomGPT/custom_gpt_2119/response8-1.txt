Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching program, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax, but you have flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties, which can be beneficial for shorter-term goals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk and enhance returns.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Allocate more aggressive investments in accounts where funds will be locked in for a longer period (like a 401(k) or IRA). Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or short-term goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely, so it may be worth seeking professional advice tailored to your situation.

This allocation strategy can help you optimize your savings for both growth and tax efficiency.
