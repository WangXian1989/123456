I'm not a medical professional, but there are several treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition you have. General options can include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and regular exercise. Medications may be prescribed to manage conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In more severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or even liver transplantation might be necessary. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
