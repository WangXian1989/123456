The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maxing out your 401(k) contribution, depending on your eligibility for tax deductions and future tax implications.

2. **Consider Tax Diversification**:
   - Contribute to a mix of accounts to diversify your tax exposure in retirement. A combination of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility in withdrawal strategies later.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Higher-risk investments might be better suited for tax-deferred accounts where gains are not taxed until withdrawal, while lower-risk, income-generating investments could be more efficient in taxable accounts to utilize lower capital gains rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will draw down your accounts in retirement. This might influence how much you prioritize each account type now to optimize taxes when you need to withdraw funds.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and financial goals. Adjust contributions accordingly to stay on track.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
