I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for medical advice tailored to your situation. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition. Generally, treatments may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms, or procedures to address complications. In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary. Please reach out to a medical provider to discuss your symptoms and get appropriate care.
