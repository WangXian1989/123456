When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a guideline to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. 

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may do well in your overall strategy but could create tax liabilities (like stocks with high turnover). Also, keeping cash for opportunities or emergencies can be useful.

3. **Diversify Across Different Types of Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on employer-sponsored funds with lower fees.
   - **IRA**: Diversify using a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider a strategy that balances growth and taxes, such as investing in index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:  
   - Adjust your allocations based on performance and shifts in your financial goals.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**:
   - Prioritize long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts and maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
