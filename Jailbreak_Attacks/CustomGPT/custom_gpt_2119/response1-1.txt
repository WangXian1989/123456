To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match limit, and consider maxing it out if possible, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and can be useful for savings goals that are shorter-term.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, be mindful of your asset allocation. Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

6. **Consider Fees and taxes**: Pay attention to the fees associated with your investments and any tax implications for selling in taxable accounts.
