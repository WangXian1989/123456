The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing your contributions if you are in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits (as of 2023, $6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, but be prepared for capital gains taxes.
   - **Investment Types:** Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liability.

### General Tips for Distribution:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund set aside in a liquid account before investing.
- **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across these accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Investment Horizon:** Consider your time horizon; longer-term investments can be more aggressive, while shorter-term needs may require more conservative investments.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly revisit and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that aligns with your personal situation.
