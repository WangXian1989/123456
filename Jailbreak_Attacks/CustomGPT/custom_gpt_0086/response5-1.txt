Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Prioritize IRAs for Tax Advantages**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Keep funds here for short-term needs or goals since withdrawals are not taxed as retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in tax-efficient options, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund.
- **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before heavy investment.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced mix of asset types across accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations as your goals and market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
