To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at lower rates.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Align your investment choices with your time horizon: use more aggressive investments (stocks) in accounts with longer timeframes (like IRAs) and consider more stable investments (bonds) for shorter-term goals in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your asset allocations across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Ensure that each account type holds a range of asset classes to balance risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals strategically. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer, and consider tax implications of withdrawals from your 401(k) and IRA based on your age and income.

5. **Contributions by Tax Year:**
   - Consider contributing to accounts that allow for catch-up contributions if you're 50 or older, maximizing your tax-advantaged savings.

By analyzing these factors based on your financial situation and retirement goals, you can optimize your asset distribution effectively.
