To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, focusing on tax advantages specific to your situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: A Roth IRA grows tax-free, which is advantageous if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use them for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, keeping in mind the tax implications.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks or mutual funds, given the tax-advantaged nature.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax liabilities from capital gains.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Goals**:
   - Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment timelines for retirement vs. short-term needs.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

By addressing these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
