Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to make use of lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Balance risk across all accounts, ensuring a diversified portfolio in line with your risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate account with easy access for emergencies instead of relying solely on retirement accounts.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

By following these strategies, you can create a tailored approach to your investment distribution, maximizing growth and minimizing taxes.
