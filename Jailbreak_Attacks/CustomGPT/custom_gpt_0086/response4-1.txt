Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially "free" money.
- **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Consider whether you want to allocate contributions to a traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) 401(k) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).
- **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- **Income Restrictions**: Check if you qualify for Roth contributions based on your income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquidity**: Use these for goals that require access to funds before retirement, as they have no withdrawal restrictions.
- **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains when withdrawing from taxable accounts.
- **Dividend Stocks or Index Funds**: Consider investments that yield favorable tax treatment in taxable accounts.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before aggressively funding retirement accounts.
2. **Debt Repayment**: Address high-interest debt if applicable.
3. **Diversification**: Allocate investments across different asset classes to reduce risk.
4. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### **Suggested Order of Contributions**
1. Max out your 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional based on your goals).
3. Continue maxing out your 401(k) to the contribution limit.
4. Fund a taxable account with excess savings.

### **Consultation**
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your financial situation.
