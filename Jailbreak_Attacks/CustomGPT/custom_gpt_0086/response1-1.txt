Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can reduce taxable income now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing the match and IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k). Focus on increasing your contributions as your budget allows.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for goals outside retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across these accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy annually or after significant life events to align with changing goals or market conditions.
