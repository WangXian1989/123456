Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - **Contribute enough** to get any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Fund an IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to a **Traditional IRA** or **Roth IRA** depending on your tax situation:
     - **Traditional IRA**: For tax-deferred growth, good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: For tax-free growth, ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**:
   - After maxing out the IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit for additional tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, consider investing in taxable accounts:
     - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, tax-managed funds).
     - Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your investments across all accounts based on changes in market conditions, your goals, and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consider Your Timeline**:
   - If you have short-term goals (buying a home, education), keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts.
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailored advice from a professional can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your distributions among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
