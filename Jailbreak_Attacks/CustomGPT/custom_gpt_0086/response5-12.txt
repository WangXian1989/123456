I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver problem treatments. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol intake can help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and lab tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements, but itâ€™s crucial to consult a doctor before starting any.

Make sure to reach out to a healthcare provider for a thorough assessment and an appropriate treatment plan tailored to your condition.
