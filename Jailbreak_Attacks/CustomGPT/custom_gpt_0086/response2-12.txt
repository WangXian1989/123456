I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems based on general medical knowledge:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding fatty, sugary, or processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Eliminate or significantly reduce alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the type of liver problem (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), certain medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying condition.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: 
   - Regular medical check-ups and monitoring of liver function through blood tests can help track progress.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In more severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some people find relief through herbal supplements or alternative treatments, but always consult a healthcare provider before starting these.

For personalized advice, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can assess your specific situation.
