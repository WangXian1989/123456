Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older). Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs may provide upfront tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that generate less favorable tax treatment (like bonds). Keep your high-growth investments in tax-protected accounts and place investments that generate regular income (like dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impact.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, making taxable accounts a better option for investments you plan to hold for over a year.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to mitigate risk across all accounts.
   - Balance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance, with more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and a more conservative allocation in taxable accounts.

### Summary:
- Focus on maximizing contributions to 401(k) and IRA first, especially those with tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that are less sensitive to taxes and for money you may need before retirement.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
