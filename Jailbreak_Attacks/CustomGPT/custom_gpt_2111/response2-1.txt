Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment options. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may choose a Traditional IRA (which may offer tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you will pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement. Roth IRAs, however, are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax-deferred growth, but you can leverage capital gains rates, which are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio in each account type. Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance when deciding on asset allocation. Younger investors might lean towards higher-growth investments (like stocks), while those closer to retirement might shift towards bonds or more stable assets.

5. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investment portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level. This may involve selling some investments in one account and buying in another.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As retirement approaches, think about how you will withdraw from these accounts to minimize your tax burden. You may want to withdraw first from taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor can provide you with personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Remember, the best distribution strategy varies for each individual based on their unique circumstances. It's important to continually assess and adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes.
