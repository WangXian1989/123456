I'm not a doctor, but I recommend you speak with a healthcare professional about your liver problem. They can provide personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment might include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medication, or in some cases, more advanced procedures. Please consult a physician for accurate information.
