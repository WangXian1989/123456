Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - Consider maximizing your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and needs).

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k): Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - IRA: A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement under certain conditions.
   - Taxable Accounts: Earnings from investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, and you'll pay taxes on dividends and interest each year.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments to mitigate risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about your long-term withdrawal strategy. Taxable accounts might provide for more flexible withdrawals, while you might want to avoid withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts until necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your unique financial situation.

Remember, these are general strategies, and individual circumstances can greatly influence the best approach. Always consider your specific goals and financial situation.
