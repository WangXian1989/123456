Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline to help you make informed choices:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine whether you're saving for retirement, a major purchase, or other financial goals. This will influence how you allocate funds.

2. **Consider Employer Benefits**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the yearly contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the maximum contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're age 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).

4. **Diversify Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth like 401(k)s, but contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have contribution limits and allow you to access your money at any time, but capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments for a profit.

5. **Optimize Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds or real estate) perform better in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds) can be held in taxable accounts since they often generate fewer taxable events.

6. **Regularly Reassess and Rebalance**: Your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance may change. Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy for your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, maximizing the benefits of each type of account according to your financial goals.
