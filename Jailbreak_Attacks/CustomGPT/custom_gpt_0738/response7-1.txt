Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs use after-tax contributions but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Use these for short-to-medium-term goals where you may need access to funds.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) before heavily investing in these accounts.

### 4. **Investment Diversification**
   - Consider diversifying your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Retirement Strategy**
   - As you get closer to retirement, shift your investments to more conservative options (bonds, cash equivalents) in your 401(k) and IRA, but keep in mind to maintain some growth (stocks) for long-term gains.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement; typically, it makes sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute up to your employer match, then consider further contributions based on your tax situation.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible, focusing on Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any remaining funds here, especially for short-term goals or to keep your investments flexible without tax penalties.

### Conclusion
Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that considers your unique circumstances, including tax optimization and future withdrawal needs.
