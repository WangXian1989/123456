Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is "free money."
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains, but they offer more flexibility and access than retirement accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Long-term Growth:** Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments, focusing on growth stocks or mutual funds.
   - **Income Generation:** Consider bonds or dividend-producing stocks in taxable accounts to manage taxable income.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Ensure you have cash or easily liquidated assets in a taxable account for emergency funds or short-term needs, as withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties and taxes.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and re-balance as needed, considering life changes, market conditions, and financial goals.

### Conclusion:
Start with employee benefits, take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, and then consider taxable investment options. Tailor your strategy based on your tax bracket, investment horizon, and personal preferences. Consulting with a financial advisor can help finalize your plan.
