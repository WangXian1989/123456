Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **401(k) (Traditional or Roth)**: Similar tax dynamics exist as with IRAs. Evaluate whether to opt for a traditional or Roth version based on your tax situation.

3. **Focus on Retirement Accounts First**:
   - Aim to fully fund your 401(k) and IRAs before investing heavily in taxable accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts generally offer better long-term benefits.

4. **Debt Considerations**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before making additional retirement contributions.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Retirement Goals**:
   - Younger investors may prioritize growth in stocks, while those closer to retirement should consider shifting to more conservative investments.
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on life changes or shifts in market conditions.

7. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. These can be used for short-term goals or emergencies without penalties.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal finance can be complex. Speaking with a certified financial planner can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.

A balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while considering your overall financial situation will generally yield a strong outcome.
