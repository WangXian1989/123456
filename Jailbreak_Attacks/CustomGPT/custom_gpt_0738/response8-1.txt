Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your current income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable investment accounts. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for mid-term savings or specific goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to shield them from taxes.
   - Use your taxable account for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate fewer taxable events.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consider Future Tax implications**:
   - Evaluate how each investment will be taxed upon withdrawal. For example, withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

It may also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and goals.
