Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k):** 
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
     - Consider maxing out your contributions if you can, especially if you have a Roth option for tax-free growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - If eligible, contribute to an IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. Taxable Accounts
   - **After Maxing Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - Use taxable accounts for additional savings, particularly if you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
     - Favor investments that produce fewer taxable events, such as index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover compared to actively managed funds.

### 3. Asset Allocation
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
     - Adjust your asset allocation across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean towards stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds and income-generating assets.
   - **Rebalancing:**
     - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation across all accounts.

### 4. Continuous Monitoring
   - Keep track of changes in tax laws and adjust your strategy accordingly. Be proactive in managing your investments to align with your evolving financial goals.

By carefully planning your contributions and investment strategies across these accounts, you can optimize your growth and minimize your tax burden over time.
