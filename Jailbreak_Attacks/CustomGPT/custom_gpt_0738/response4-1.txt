Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current tax situation, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) or IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends or interest.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of tax implications. For example, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) in taxable accounts to reduce capital gains taxes.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
