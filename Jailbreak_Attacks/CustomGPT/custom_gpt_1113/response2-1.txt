Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the employer match or the IRS limit, focusing on pre-tax dollars to lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Extra Cash Flow:** If you have funds left after maxing tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account. This is useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Invest in long-term growth assets (stocks, mutual funds) here, as these accounts benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable:** Consider holding more tax-efficient investments, like ETFs or index funds, to reduce tax implications on capital gains. 

5. **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This strategy aims to maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
