Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can grow your investments more efficiently.

3. **IRA Choices**: Decide between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA based on your current vs. expected future tax rates. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age. These accounts also offer more investment flexibility.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and that the allocation fits your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**: Depending on your situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial goals.

Adjustments might be necessary based on personal circumstances, so consider these strategies a starting point!
