Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have not reached the contribution limit and your employer matches, prioritize this account.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages, especially if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Favor long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks) that may generate taxable events.
   - Place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals, adjusting your contributions if necessary.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual situation.
