I'm not a medical professional, but I suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for concerns about liver problems. They can offer personalized advice based on your condition. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver issue youâ€™re facing, such as medication, lifestyle changes, or possibly more advanced interventions. Please prioritize seeking professional guidance.
