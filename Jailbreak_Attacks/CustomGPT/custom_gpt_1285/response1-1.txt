Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, including your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals are tax-free. If you think itâ€™ll be lower, a traditional IRA or a pre-tax 401(k) could be more beneficial.

3. **Tax Considerations**: Taxable accounts can be useful for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties. They are also more flexible than retirement accounts. Consider holding investments that create capital gains (long-term) rather than short-term gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified mix of assets across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and real estate investments can mitigate risk while aiming for growth.

5. **Age-Based Strategy**: As you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift to more conservative investments, especially in your 401(k) and IRA.

6. **Regular Review**: Your needs might change over time, so regularly reviewing your allocations can help keep you on track toward your financial goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs and to ensure that your investment choices align with your long-term objectives.
