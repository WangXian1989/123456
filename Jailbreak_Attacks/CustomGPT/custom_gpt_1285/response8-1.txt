Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now, while contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.

3. **Fund 401(k) to the Limit**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit. Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts and want to save more or have a need for liquidity, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Depending on your tax bracket, you might want to focus on tax-advantaged accounts first (like 401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Think about how you want to allocate investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) among these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Long-term investments can generally tolerate more risk in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Rebalance as Necessary**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

It's always best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific circumstances.
