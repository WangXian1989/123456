It's essential to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Generally, here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as that’s essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your situation). 

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Accounts**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off first before contributing excessively to investment accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across accounts are diversified. You can hold different assets in each account based on tax implications—higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more income-producing investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Consider the type of investments you hold. Taxable accounts can benefit from capital gains which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, while tax-advantaged accounts can be used for high-growth investments without tax implications until withdrawal.

5. **Long-Term Planning**: Think about your retirement plan, future tax implications, and what funds will best serve your needs in retirement. Adjust contributions accordingly as your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor would also provide tailored advice specific to your circumstances.
