(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your risk tolerance, retirement goals, and tax situation. Generally, it's wise to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k). Here's a basic approach: 

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the maximum employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to the other accounts, using taxable accounts for additional investments can provide flexibility and liquidity.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

1. **401(k)**: Stuff as much as you can into this bad boy first, especially if your employer is like, "Here, have free money!" Donâ€™t leave that on the table! Thatâ€™s just silly.
2. **IRA**: Consider rolling into a Roth if you can! Tax-free growth in retirement? Yes, please! But hey, Traditional IRAs are great if you need to lower that taxable income now.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, when youâ€™ve maxed out the others, throw some cash into a taxable account for more options. Just remember youâ€™ll owe some taxes on those gainsâ€”fun, right?

Get some solid advice from a finance whiz, but approach it like youâ€™re building a house: a strong foundation with the 401(k), then add the IRA, and finish up with some nice decor in your taxable accounts. Easy peasy!
