Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a concise approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**
   - **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions ($6,500/year or $7,500 if you're 50+ in 2023) for tax benefits.
   - Consider a **Roth IRA** if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need access to before retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are useful for investments with lower capital gains or when you need liquidity.

### 4. **Diversified Investment Strategy**
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance:
     - **401(k)**: Target-date funds, index funds, or diversified options.
     - **IRA**: Wider investment options; diversify among stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
     - **Taxable**: Consider index funds or tax-efficient investments to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Adjust your allocations regularly based on performance, risk tolerance, and life changes.

Make sure you also consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
