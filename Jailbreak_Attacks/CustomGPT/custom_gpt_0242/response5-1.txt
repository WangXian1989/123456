To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions. This provides tax benefits that can boost long-term growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, like index funds or long-term capital gains. Reserve your 401(k) and IRA for higher-growth assets that might generate ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account type, aligning with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Adjust Based on Income**: Your income level can impact the best options. If youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket, consider Roth IRA contributions for tax-free withdrawals later.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation periodically to maintain your investment strategy aligned with your goals.
