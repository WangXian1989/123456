I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Avoid alcohol, follow a balanced diet, and maintain a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: For conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease, specific medications can help.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function.
4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
