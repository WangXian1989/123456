To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategic steps:

### ðŸ“Š Strategy Overview
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate higher taxes (e.g., bonds).
   - Save more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) for taxable accounts.

### ðŸ’° Account Allocation Tips
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match; consider maxing out if possible.
- **IRA**: Fund this next, preferably a Roth IRA if you qualify (benefits from tax-free growth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for short-term savings and investments not fitting into tax-advantaged accounts.

### ðŸ“ˆ Long-Term Considerations
- Rebalance regularly based on performance and changing tax laws.
- Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice aligned with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

Diversifying investments across these accounts helps optimize growth while managing tax implications.
