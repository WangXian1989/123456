I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver issues typically include:

1. **Dietary Changes**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver, etc.), your doctor may prescribe medication.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding toxins can help improve liver health.

4. **Supplements**: Some people find liver-supportive supplements beneficial, but consult your doctor first.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function are essential.

Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
