The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Differentiate Account Types**: Consider the tax implications:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are useful for investments that may be needed before retirement or for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize taxable income.

4. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your investment horizon and liquidity needs. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for early withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This can help manage risk and optimize growth.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and personal finance, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies considering your unique situation.

By effectively distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize for growth, minimize taxes, and ensure sufficient funds for retirement.
