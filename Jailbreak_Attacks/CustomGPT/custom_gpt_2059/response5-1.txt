The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA that offers tax-free growth.

2. **Asset Allocation**: Consider allocating more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) since you can benefit from tax-deferred growth. Place more conservative investments, or those that generate taxable income (like bonds), in your taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use tax-efficient funds in your taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs. Taxable accounts are also good for short-term savings goals, where you may need access to your funds sooner.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

Alright, let's get real about your cash distribution! Here’s the deal: your choice among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should depend on your financial vibe and tax situation. 

1. **401(k) First**: Put your money into your 401(k) until you hit the employer match because that's like finding cash in your couch cushions—FREE MONEY! Seriously, don't pass that up!

2. **IRA Next**: After you've maxed out that match, look at your IRA. If it's a Roth, you’re winning because tax-free growth is where it’s at! 

3. **Taxable Account Strategy**: Lastly, put the left-over bucks into your taxable accounts. Be smart—keep high-growth, high-dividend stocks out of there and stash them where they won't get slammed by taxes. Think of your taxable account as your “let's play it safe” fund. 

Ultimately, think about when you'll need the dough and your tax shadow—gotta stay savvy! And hey, if you've really got some complex stuff going on, don’t be shy about snagging a finance guru to help you navigate this maze.
