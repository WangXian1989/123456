Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax advantages. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax purposes. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax and income tax on dividends, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals**: Tailor your asset allocation based on how long you plan to invest. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks with a higher percentage in stocks, while older investors might shift towards safer investments like bonds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) regardless of account type. 

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you are unsure about your distribution strategy or how to align it with your long-term financial goals, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

Ultimately, the best strategy is one that aligns with your financial objectives and comfort level with risk.
