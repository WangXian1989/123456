To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**  
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and increases your retirement savings exponentially.
   - Prioritize contributions up to the maximum match before moving to other accounts.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you qualify, consider maximizing your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you don't have a Roth option in your 401(k), you might benefit from contributing to a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Account Contributions:**
   - Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to your taxable accounts. Here, consider investing in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use this account for shorter-term goals or additional investments that don't fit within the limits of tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Rebalancing and Continuous Investment:**
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, market conditions, and retirement timeline.
   - Automate contributions to ensure regular investment and capitalize on dollar-cost averaging.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to maximizing your savings while minimizing taxes.
