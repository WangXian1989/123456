When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contribution if you can, particularly if you are in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be a better option.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals. They can be useful for investing in funds that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before heavily investing. Generally, 3-6 months' worth of expenses is recommended.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Base your investment choices on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors may favor more aggressive growth investments, while those closer to retirement may shift towards more conservative options.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified to spread risk across different asset classes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and adjust as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your individual circumstances and goals.
