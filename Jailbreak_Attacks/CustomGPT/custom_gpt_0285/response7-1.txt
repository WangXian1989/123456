Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth.

3. **Analyze Your Tax Situation**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) might be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect lower rates in retirement, traditional accounts may be preferable.

4. **Balance Contributions**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts can provide more flexibility in accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment objectives.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and investment opportunities change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
