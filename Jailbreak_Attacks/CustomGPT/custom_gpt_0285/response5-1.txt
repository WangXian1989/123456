(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax-advantaged retirement savings.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment mix across all accounts is well-diversified to spread risk.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about when you might withdraw funds. 401(k) and IRA accounts have specific rules about withdrawals which can impact your strategy.

1. **401(k) First, Yo**: If your job dangles a sweet 401(k) match, jump on it like itâ€™s a hot pizza. Get that free dough! Max this out first, then see whatâ€™s left.

2. **IRA for the Win**: Next, slide over to an IRA (Roth if youâ€™re young and expect to make bank later). These accounts let your money grow tax-free like a fine wine, so donâ€™t sleep on that!

3. **Taxable Accounts are Cool Too**: If you still have cash to burn, toss some into a taxable account. Itâ€™s where you can play the stock market like itâ€™s poker night, but watch those taxes, buddy!

4. **Mix It Up**: Diversification is key â€“ donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket or youâ€™ll end up scrambling! Different account types give you an edge against those taxman vibes.

5. **Plan for Your Future**: Think ahead about when you might wanna access this cash. Some accounts hit you with penalties if you touch the funds too early, so keep your eyes on the prize!

Make it work for you! ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’¸
