It's important to consult with a financial advisor or planner who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation. However, a common strategy involves considering factors such as your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments may be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, while more stable investments might be better suited for taxable accounts. Balancing contributions based on tax implications and your retirement timeline can also be beneficial.
