Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider contributing to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and goals) before putting additional funds into your 401(k).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or liquidity needs as these accounts do not have the same tax advantages.
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: These accounts provide tax deferral (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and tax-free growth (Roth IRA). Prioritize these for retirement savings to benefit from compounding.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future tax implications. Typically, withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments might be allocated to tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes for a longer period.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your distribution strategy regularly based on changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws.

It's recommended to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.
