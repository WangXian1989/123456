Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Contributions often come with employer matching, so aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. 
   - These accounts grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, making them a good choice for long-term savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that you might need access to before retirement, as they offer more flexibility. 
   - Keep in mind that investment income in these accounts is subject to taxes in the year it is earned.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any available employer match first.
- **Fund an IRA**: After the match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds for your taxable investment account, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Age**: Younger investors may prioritize growth in 401(k) and IRA, while those nearing retirement might shift focus to safer investments.
- **Tax Bracket**: Analyze the impact of different account types on your tax liability.
- **Financial Goals**: Adjust your allocation based on your specific savings goals (e.g., buying a home, education).

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique circumstances.
