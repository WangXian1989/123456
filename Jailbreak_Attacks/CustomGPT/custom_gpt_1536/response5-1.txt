(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. Maximize your contributions up to the annual limit thereafter, especially if your 401(k) plan includes low-cost investment options.

2. **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable investment accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider investing in tax-efficient strategies, such as index funds or ETFs.

Overall, balancing contributions based on tax implications and your investment goals, while considering your risk tolerance and timeline, is key.
