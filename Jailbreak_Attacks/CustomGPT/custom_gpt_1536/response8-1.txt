When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors need to be taken into account:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, with taxable withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRAs have tax-free withdrawals in retirement since contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which may be lower than ordinary income rates depending on your income level and how long you've held the investments.

2. **Retirement Goals**: Determine your retirement timeline, income needs, and risk tolerance. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth account may be beneficial.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits:
   - 401(k): $20,500 (with an additional $6,500 for those 50 or older in 2023).
   - IRA: $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 for those 50 or older in 2023).
   - Taxable accounts: No limits, but consider the tax implications of capital gains.

4. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for the 401(k), consider maximizing that first, as it is essentially "free money."

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that assets within each account are properly diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds during retirement, balancing tax efficiency and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred accounts.

A potential strategy could be:
- Max out any contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy based on your personal financial situation and goals.
