Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax-advantaged growth. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments with high potential for growth, since they can be more tax-efficient for long-term capital gains. Limit interest-bearing investments in these accounts due to higher tax implications.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This means balancing asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Strategically withdraw from accounts based on tax implications during retirement. You may want to prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or Traditional IRA) first.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan specific to your situation.
