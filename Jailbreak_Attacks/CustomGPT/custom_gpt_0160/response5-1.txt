Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA:** If eligible for a Roth IRA, consider maxing this out next. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA:** If you’re looking for a tax deduction now, this could be a good option.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are useful for short-term savings or for funds you may need before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains tax when selling investments.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If you’re farther from retirement, you might lean more heavily into equities in all accounts while gradually transitioning to more conservative investments as you approach retirement age.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Regular Contributions**
   - Set up automatic contributions to each account to ensure consistent saving.

### 7. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly to stay on track with your goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income (up to employer match)
- **IRA:** $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50, for 2023)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any residual income after maxing out the above.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
