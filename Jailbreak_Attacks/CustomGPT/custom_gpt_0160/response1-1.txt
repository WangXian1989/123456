Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a balanced approach tailored to your financial goals, tax situations, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before making significant investments.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. Consider a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Roth or Traditional IRA, choose investments with growth potential. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals beyond retirement. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments. A mix of stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents is key based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Investment Horizon**: Consider your time frame for each goal. Longer-term investments can be riskier.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: If unsure, consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

By balancing contributions across these accounts thoughtfully, you can optimize your investment growth and minimize tax liabilities.
