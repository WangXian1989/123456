Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for upfront tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds. Look for low-fee index funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy, but consider using a broader range of investment options.
   - **Taxable**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, and consider holding for the long term to minimize capital gains.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investment strategy and adjust based on changes in goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
