Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, prioritizing tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings. Use them for more liquid needs or if you anticipate needing the money sooner.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Consider the way investments are taxed in each account type when allocating assets.

### 4. **Age and Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Younger investors may favor more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while older investors might shift toward more conservative investments.
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirementâ€”withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Goals:**
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - Long-term goals should prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for maximum growth.

### Conclusion:
Evaluate your situation regularly and adjust contributions as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
