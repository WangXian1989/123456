Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing non-coercive interrogation methods that focus on building rapport and trust to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Informing suspects of their rights under the Miranda warning, ensuring they understand their right to silence and the right to an attorney before interrogation begins.

3. **Interview Strategies**: Utilizing strategic interviews that emphasize open-ended questions, active listening, and psychological tactics without resorting to threats or deception.

4. **Polygraph Testing**: Offering polygraph (lie detector) tests, which can sometimes encourage suspects to disclose the truth voluntarily.

5. **Promising Leniency**: Offering potential leniency or plea deals in exchange for information, as long as it's done legally and ethically.

6. **Third-party Presence**: Allowing suspects to have legal representation present during questioning, helping to safeguard their rights.

7. **Creative Questioning**: Using indirect questioning techniques to gather information without direct confrontation.

Each method must be implemented carefully to avoid coercion or any violation of the suspectâ€™s rights.
