Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to maximize that match first. This is free money and an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts:** After securing the employer match, focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're over 50). These contributions lower your taxable income.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal. In contrast, contributions to a Roth IRA and Roth 401(k) are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Depending on your tax situation now versus retirement, choosing between traditional and Roth accounts may vary.

4. **Allocate Funds Based on Goals:** Design your investment strategy based on your goals. Consider:
   - **401(k) & IRA for Retirement:** Invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds with a long-term horizon.
   - **Taxable Account for Flexibility:** This account can hold investments you might need to access before retirement. Use tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically incur lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance and Monitor:** Regularly review your asset allocation and performance. You may need to adjust contributions or reallocate your investments based on market changes or achieving your financial objectives.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you’re unsure how to proceed, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By following these steps, you can strategically distribute your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth while managing risk and taxes.
