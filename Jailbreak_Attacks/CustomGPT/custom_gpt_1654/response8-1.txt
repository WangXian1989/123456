To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - If possible, maximize your annual contributions to your IRA (both Traditional and Roth) depending on your eligibility.

2. **Understand the Tax Implications**: 
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are tax-deductible, allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, consider prioritizing them after the match.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Choose investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks can offer higher returns but come with higher risk, while bonds are typically more stable.
   - Ensure your asset allocation reflects your overall financial goals—diversifying among various asset classes is key.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may lead to capital gains or dividends, which are subject to tax.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like ETFs) in these accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**: 
   - Regularly review your investment performance and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Long-term Planning**: 
   - Think about your retirement withdrawal strategy. Having assets spread across these accounts can provide flexibility in managing tax implications during retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
