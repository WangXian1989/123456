Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to maximize your tax benefits and grow your investments. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA/ROTH IRA:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Tax Implications:**  
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) for traditional accounts. Roth IRAs don’t offer immediate tax breaks, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are funded with after-tax dollars, and while they don't offer tax advantages like retirement accounts, they provide flexibility for withdrawals and may benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon:** The allocation may depend on your time until retirement and investment goals. Generally, a more aggressive allocation in growth-oriented assets is advised for younger investors.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Within these accounts, aim for a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance. 

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation:** Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio ensures that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailoring a strategy that considers your individual circumstances, such as income level, tax situation, and retirement goals, would be beneficial.

Remember to consider factors like contribution limits, your age, and your retirement timeline when making these decisions.
