When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a structured approach to help you allocate your investments:

### 1. Understand Account Types and Their Advantages:
   - **401(k)**:
     - Employer-sponsored, often includes matching contributions.
     - Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
     - Can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax).
     - Offers more investment options than many employer plans.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - No contribution limits; you can withdraw without penalties.
     - Capital gains tax applies to profits when you sell investments.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Fund an IRA**: If you’re eligible and have additional funds, consider contributing to an IRA for its tax benefits. Choose between a Traditional or Roth based on your current tax bracket versus expected retirement bracket.

### 3. Assess Tax Implications:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial despite paying taxes now.
   - Taxable accounts are more flexible but consider capital gains taxes when withdrawing funds.

### 4. Diversify Within Accounts:
   - Use the taxable account for more liquid investments and assets that generate qualified dividends to minimize tax liability.
   - Consider keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to reduce taxes on capital gains.

### 5. Regularly Review and Adjust:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation across all account types. 

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Max out 401(k) contributions up to the match limit.
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, focusing on tax-free growth.
- Invest additional savings into a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility, particularly for short to medium-term goals.

### Final Thoughts:
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary per individual based on their financial goals, age, and overall financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
