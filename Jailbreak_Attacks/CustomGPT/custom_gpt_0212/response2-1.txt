Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your savings and tax efficiency. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available—this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Contribute up to the annual limit if you can.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Traditional IRAs may be more beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to maximize your annual contributions to the IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain broader investment options and liquidity here, allowing for flexibility and access to funds if needed.

### General Tips:

- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consider Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your investment strategy should align with your age, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance.
- **Tax Strategy**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts, especially in retirement.
