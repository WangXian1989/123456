To optimize your distribution of money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to accounts with tax benefits:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowed, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account or low-risk instruments.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term investments or if you expect to need access to funds within a few years. 

5. **Investment Strategy**: Choose your investments based on your goals and risk tolerance. Generally:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on target-date funds or diversified funds.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly index funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like ETFs or municipal bonds.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

If you're unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
