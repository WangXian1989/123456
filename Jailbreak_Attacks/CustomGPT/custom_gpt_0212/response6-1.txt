To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, max out contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that might generate high taxes (e.g., stocks held for less than a year).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) for risk management.
   - **Rebalance Periodically:** Adjust your portfolio based on performance and market conditions.

### Summary
- **Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.**
- **Use taxable accounts for flexible investments and tax-efficient strategies.**
