I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit sugar and processed foods.
   - Exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or drugs to reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups with blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Specific Treatments**:
   - For conditions like hepatitis C or alcoholic liver disease, treatments will vary; consult with a healthcare provider for tailored options.

5. **Liver Transplant**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment options.
