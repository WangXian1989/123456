Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several factors. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. It's tax-deferred, so it's good for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you'll need access to before retirement, and consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Match investments to your goals and timelines. Long-term goals may benefit from aggressive growth strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across all accounts, ensuring you don't concentrate too much of any single investment type or sector.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund; avoid using retirement accounts for this purpose as it's generally not advisable.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Continually assess and rebalance your portfolio based on market conditions and your changing goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your specific circumstances.
