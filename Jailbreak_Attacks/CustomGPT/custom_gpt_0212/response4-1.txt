To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for maximizing tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Use them for more liquid investments.

2. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across accounts.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize contributions.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By balancing these elements, you can create a tailored distribution strategy that suits your financial objectives.
