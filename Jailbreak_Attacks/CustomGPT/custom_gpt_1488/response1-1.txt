To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA and 401(k). These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings growth.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments with higher potential returns (like stocks), as they benefit more from tax deferral. Keep safer investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since their interest is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use your taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that may need to be accessed sooner, as they don’t have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing funds from each account type, especially if you expect your income to change in the future.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: If you’re unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation.

Ultimately, your best distribution will depend on your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
