When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Prioritize contributions that provide tax benefits. Higher-income earners might favor traditional 401(k) and IRA for tax deductions.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If available, consider a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as these grow tax-free.

3. **Liquidity Needs**: Maintain adequate cash in taxable accounts for short-term goals. Consider your immediate liquidity needs before locking money away in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. Taxable accounts may be better for more aggressive investments, while retirement accounts could focus on long-term growth.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan for a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy to minimize tax liability. It often makes sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts if necessary.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
