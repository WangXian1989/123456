Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investments and minimize taxes. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., index funds, ETFs) since capital gains are taxed more favorably than ordinary income.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate more toward **stocks** in your 401(k) and IRA if you have a long-term horizon, as these accounts will benefit from tax-free growth.

### 4. **Balance Between Growth and Stability**
   - Use stable investments (like bonds) in your taxable accounts to manage risk while taking advantage of tax benefits in your retirement accounts.

### Summary
- **Start with Maxing Match**: Focus on the 401(k) first.
- **Diversify Appropriately**: Use IRAs for long-term growth and taxable accounts for liquidity with tax-efficient investments.

This approach aims to enhance your growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
