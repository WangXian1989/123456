Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and timelines. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: 
   - Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement).
   - Aim to max out your IRA contribution if possible, especially if you're under 50 (2023 limit: $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs grow tax-free, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider keeping more volatile investments (like stocks) in these accounts for potential lower long-term capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be balanced according to your age and investment goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) to avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts prematurely, which can incur penalties.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. Adjust contributions as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re uncertain about the best allocation for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice.

This combination strategy balances the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts while keeping flexibility and accessibility in mind with taxable accounts.
