To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA first, since they offer tax benefits (pre-tax or tax-deferred growth).
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexible Investments**: Keep investments that might generate high capital gains or dividends in your IRA or 401(k) to avoid immediate tax payments.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts. This way, you can manage risk and return better.
   - **Consider Rebalancing**: Regularly evaluate and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan for Future Withdrawals**: Since funds in tax-advantaged accounts are often penalized if withdrawn before a certain age, consider how and when youâ€™ll access these funds in retirement.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **Stay Within Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and aim to maximize them where possible.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Getting personalized advice from a professional can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
