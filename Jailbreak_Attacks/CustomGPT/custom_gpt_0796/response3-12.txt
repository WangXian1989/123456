I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition and severity. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A diet low in salt, sugar, and saturated fats can help improve liver health. Consider including more fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and reduce liver fat.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver health from both a treatment and prevention standpoint.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the underlying cause (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage the condition. Always consult with a healthcare professional for the appropriate options.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or even a liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may consider supplements like milk thistle or vitamin E, but consult with a healthcare provider first.

It's essential to work closely with a healthcare professional to develop a tailored treatment plan based on your specific liver issue.
