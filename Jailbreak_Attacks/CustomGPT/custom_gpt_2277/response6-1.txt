Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s an approach to optimize your allocation:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Determine if your needs are short-term (e.g., buying a house) or long-term (e.g., retirement).
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquid savings before investing heavily.

### 2. Tax Efficiency
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might access before retirement age; focus on tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds).

### 3. Suggested Allocation Strategy
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
     - Next, fund your IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 4. Regular Reassessment
   - Review your portfolio allocation annually to adjust based on performance, changes in goals, or tax laws.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts can optimize growth while managing your tax liabilities. Consulting a financial advisor may also help tailor a plan specific to your situation.
