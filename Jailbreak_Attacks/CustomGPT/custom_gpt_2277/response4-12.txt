I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures based on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A healthy, balanced diet low in alcohol, saturated fats, and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the cause (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Reducing exposure to harmful substances can help protect the liver.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations for the best outcome.
