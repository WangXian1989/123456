Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Aim to max out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) match, especially if you qualify for deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. This account is best for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Keep riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Shorter-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access sooner, as they offer more liquidity.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Check your allocations periodically, adjusting based on performance and life changes (like income level, risk tolerance, and financial objectives).

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor strategies based on your specific financial situation.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (to the match limit)
- **IRA:** Max contribution ($6,500 for 2023)
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
It's essential to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts when possible, balance your investments based on your time horizon, and regularly adjust your strategy as needed.
