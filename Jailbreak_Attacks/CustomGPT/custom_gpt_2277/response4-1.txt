Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts using tax-efficient strategies. Consider index funds or ETFs for lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and align with your investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to keep your investments aligned with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw from each account type in retirement, as this can affect your tax liabilities.

It’s advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
