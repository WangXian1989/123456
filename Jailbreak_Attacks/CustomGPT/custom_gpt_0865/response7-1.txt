To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for contributions to your 401(k), prioritize that contribution up to the match limit, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, the tax implications differ. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should generally hold investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investing Timeline**: Consider your time horizon for different investments:
   - For short-term needs (less than 5 years), prioritize saving in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - For long-term goals, tax-deferral accounts (401(k) and IRA) can be more beneficial.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across accounts:
   - Consider riskier assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - More stable investments (bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes, starting with taxable accounts and strategically managing distributions from tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Keep an eye on the annual contribution limits for each account type and aim to maximize contributions within those limits.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy that matches your specific financial situation and goals, consulting with a financial advisor can be beneficial.

Balancing contributions and investments across these accounts will optimize your tax situation and help you achieve your financial goals efficiently.
