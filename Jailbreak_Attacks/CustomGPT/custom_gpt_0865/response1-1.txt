To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Depending on your tax situation, determine whether to contribute to a traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax) IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Best for funds you may need accessible before retirement or for investments that generate capital gains.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Longer-term investments can be more aggressively allocated towards stocks in retirement accounts, while shorter-term needs might be placed in safer assets.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your financial goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your personal financial situation and goals.

Always factor in your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline when making decisions.
