Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plan. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially 'free money.'

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket. These accounts can provide tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you have maxed out these tax-advantaged accounts, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k) or taxable accounts. 

4. **Investment Choices**: Consider the tax implications of your investments. Taxable accounts are best for investments with low turnover or capital gains, while tax-advantaged accounts can hold high-growth investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on your tax situation in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Regular Reviews**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in tax laws, and your personal financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: To tailor a strategy specifically to your circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor, especially for complex situations.

This strategy aims to optimize your investments for growth while minimizing your tax liabilities over time.
