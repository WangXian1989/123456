To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, since contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund Considerations**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a taxable account before maximizing contribution limits, as you need access to cash readily.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals (without penalties) and can be useful for shorter-term goals.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Asset allocation can differ between tax-advantaged accounts and taxable accounts based on tax implications.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place your most tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to maximize after-tax returns.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Regularly review your investment strategy and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax implications and your individual circumstances, consulting a financial advisor can offer personalized strategies.

This approach can help ensure you're taking full advantage of tax benefits while aligning your investments with your financial goals.
