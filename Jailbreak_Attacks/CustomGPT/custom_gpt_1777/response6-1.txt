Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help you maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities. Here's a basic guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Aim for at least 15% of your salary if you can afford it, adjusting based on your financial goals.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After ensuring you're getting the full match on your 401(k), contribute to an IRA. For tax diversification, consider contributing to both Traditional (tax-deductible) and Roth (tax-free growth) IRAs if eligible.
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, prioritize this for its tax-free growth potential.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Any leftover funds can be allocated to taxable brokerage accounts, focusing on investments that generate lower capital gains (like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs).
   - This account provides liquidity and flexibility for short-term financial goals or emergencies.

4. **Consider Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your portfolio by including a mix of stocks and bonds, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**:
   - Annually review and rebalance your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals.

Before making specific investment decisions, consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your unique financial situation and goals.
