The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match before directing additional funds to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, it's beneficial to fund your 401(k) and IRA accounts first, as they offer tax advantages. Traditional accounts provide tax deductions now, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (plus $7,500 if you're over 50) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 if over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts, especially if you need access to the money before retirement age or want more investment options.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Remember, the best approach depends on your circumstances, so consider your current financial needs, future goals, and tax implications when deciding how to distribute your money.
