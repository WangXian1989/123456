Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Reduces your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Profits are taxed at capital gains rates, which can be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates over the long term.

### 3. **Maintain Liquidity**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for short-term needs in your taxable account, as funds in retirement accounts can incur penalties for early withdrawal.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, aggressive growth investments may be more suitable in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be held in taxable accounts to manage taxes efficiently.

### Summary
- **401(k)**: Get the employer match and contribute as much as you can.
- **IRA**: Maximize contributions; choose between traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable accounts**: Use for flexible goals and investments that may generate a lower tax burden.

Considering these factors will help you create an effective strategy for managing your savings.
