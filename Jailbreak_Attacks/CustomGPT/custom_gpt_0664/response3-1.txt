Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)s), which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for investments that might be needed before retirement age, offering more flexibility.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all three types of accounts.

4. **Tax-Efficient Investments**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while holding higher-taxed assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Adjust for Withdrawal Needs**:
   - If you're nearing retirement, consider shifting more towards safer investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while keeping taxable accounts more liquid.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized plan considering all your financial aspects can be beneficial.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a well-balanced investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
