To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if offered.
   - **Consider tax advantages**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now. Roth 401(k) contributions provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose between Roth and Traditional**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Annual Limit**: Be mindful of contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or as a supplement to retirement accounts.
   - **Focus on tax-efficient investments**: Consider index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return based on your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term goals can benefit from the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
