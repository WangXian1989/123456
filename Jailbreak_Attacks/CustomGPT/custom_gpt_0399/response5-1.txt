Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out your employer's match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing enough to reach the maximum annual limit, especially if you’re in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - If you have a traditional IRA, remember contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short- to medium-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Tips**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
