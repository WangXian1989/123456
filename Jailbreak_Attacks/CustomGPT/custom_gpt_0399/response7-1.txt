Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA (if eligible). Otherwise, prioritize traditional accounts for tax deferral.

3. **Tax Optimization**:
   - Use your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.
   - Utilize your IRA for potential tax-free growth with a Roth.
   - Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio in all accounts to balance risk and growth across different asset classes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your unique circumstances.

This balanced approach aims to optimize tax efficiency and investment growth over the long term.
