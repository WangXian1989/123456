To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower capital gains or dividend taxes, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.
   - Hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account type to minimize risk.

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on market performance and personal goals.

This balanced approach will help optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
