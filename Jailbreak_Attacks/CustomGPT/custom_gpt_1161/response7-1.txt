The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match (if available) since it's essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it offers tax benefits (traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, which can be advantageous for long-term growth. However, when withdrawing from these accounts, you will owe taxes on the distributions. Conversely, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts, on the other hand, are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains annually.

3. **Diversify Investments**: In your taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liability. This includes holding certain stocks or funds for the long term.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly revisit your allocations based on market performance and personal financial changes. Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, ensuring your investment strategy is optimized for your long-term financial health.

Every situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to assess your overall financial picture and goals.
