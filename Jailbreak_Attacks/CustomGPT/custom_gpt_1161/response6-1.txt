When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your individual financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some key points to guide your decision:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions, if feasible, to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your current tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and allocate more growth-oriented investments (like stocks) to taxable accounts to maximize after-tax returns.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level.

By strategically distributing your money considering these factors, you can optimize your retirement savings while effectively managing your tax liabilities. Always remember to review and adjust your strategy based on changing financial circumstances and goals.
