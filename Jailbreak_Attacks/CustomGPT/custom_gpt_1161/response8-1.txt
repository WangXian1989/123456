Investing your money wisely across different types of accounts is essential for maximizing your long-term growth and minimizing tax liabilities. Here are some principles to consider for distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Place higher-growth investments like stocks here, as they can compound without capital gains taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: If you qualify, it’s beneficial to hold your most appreciated assets here for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep income-generating investments (bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts since they generate taxable income.

3. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investments with your goals. For longer-term goals, increase your equity exposure in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, consider more conservative investments.

4. **Rebalance Based on Performance and Market Conditions**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired level of risk and return.

5. **Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting in Taxable Accounts**:
   - You can sell losing investments to offset gains and reduce your taxable income.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. It’s essential to regularly review your strategy as your situation changes.

Make sure to consider these factors while creating a balanced and diversified investment approach!
