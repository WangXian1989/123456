I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit processed foods.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to assess liver function.

4. **Weight Management**: Losing weight can help reduce liver fat in conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

5. **Avoid Toxins**: Stay away from environmental toxins, chemicals, and certain medications that can harm the liver.

6. **Potential Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation might be options.

Make sure to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition.
