Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. If you can, aim to max out contributions ($22,500 for those under 50 in 2023).
- **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility with withdrawals and investment options. This may include stocks, bonds, or mutual funds that fit your risk profile.

### 3. Diversify Investment Strategies
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments across all accounts. This might mean holding different types of assets (stocks vs. bonds) in each account to optimize tax implications and growth potential.

### Additional Considerations
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs), to allow tax-free growth in your Roth IRA for as long as possible.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Individual circumstances can vary widely, so consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies and insights.

This approach can help you balance growth potential and tax efficiency as you save for retirement while maintaining flexibility in your investment strategies.
