   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet, avoiding excess sugars, fats, and alcohol.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can be effective.
   - **Liver Supplements**: Some may use milk thistle or other supplements, but consult your doctor first.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.
   - **Endoscopic Procedures**: To treat complications like varices or gallstones.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to track your condition.

Make sure to discuss these options with your healthcare provider for tailored advice.
