Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider fully funding your IRA next. IRAs offer tax advantages, either tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).

3. **Contribute More to 401(k)**: After funding the IRA, go back and contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you want access to funds before retirement or for other financial goals, consider contributions to a taxable account. This can also include investments that may generate capital gains if held long-term.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about how each account's tax treatment will affect your overall tax burden both now and in the future. 

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes and investment types based on your risk tolerance.

7. **Regular Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocation and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this plan to your specific situation.
