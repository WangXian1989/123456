To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing any match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your total portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) irrespective of the account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investment allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your financial goals and situation.
