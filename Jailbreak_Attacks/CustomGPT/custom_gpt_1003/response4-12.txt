I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for specific treatment options for liver problems. Treatment can vary significantly depending on the underlying condition. Generally, options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Reducing fat, sugar, and salt intake, and increasing fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine check-ups to monitor liver function tests.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from liver-supportive supplements, but always consult a doctor first.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
