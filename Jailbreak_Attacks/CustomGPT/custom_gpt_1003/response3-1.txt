Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). Aim to max it out if possible, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now. Max out contributions if your budget allows.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on stock-heavy investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA), as this can help reduce the tax impact of capital gains.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid or lower-risk investments in taxable accounts to maintain flexibility.

### 3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) that minimize taxable distributions.
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Income & Goals**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, contributing more to a taxable account may be beneficial.
   - Regularly review and adjust based on your financial situation and market performance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can optimize your investments based on your unique circumstances.

### Conclusion
Generally, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, focus on long-term growth investments there, and use taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term needs. Regularly reassess your strategy as your situation changes.
