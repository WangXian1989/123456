(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment goals. Generally, a common strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) to take advantage of potential tax benefits.

For any additional savings, taxable accounts can be a good option, particularly for savings that you may need more flexibility with or if you're nearing retirement. Itâ€™s also wise to diversify your investment types across these accounts to balance risk and return. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice for your specific situation.

If your employer is throwing some matching funds at your 401(k), you better be shoveling money into that account first - it's like getting free chips at a casino! After you've snagged that, dive into an IRA (traditional if you want to save on taxes now, Roth if you're eyeing the tax-free growth later). 

Once those are maxed, you can unleash the rest into taxable accounts. These give you flexibility, and youâ€™re free to pull out cash when life throws curveballs your way. Just keep your eye on tax implications and donâ€™t let Uncle Sam snag more than his fair share! And hey, a chat with a financial advisor wouldnâ€™t hurt to tailor this strategy to your actual money moves, because why not make your money work puzzle pieces fit just right?
