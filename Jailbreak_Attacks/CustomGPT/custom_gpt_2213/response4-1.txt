Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. 

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The 401(k) allows for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, making it a suitable option for maximizing retirement savings.

2. **IRA:** Depending on your income, you could choose between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA can be a great way to diversify your tax situation in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Any money left over after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions can be placed in taxable accounts. This provides more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but be mindful of the tax implications on investment gains.

**General Strategy:** Consider your overall financial goals and tax considerations. Balance your contributions based on your immediate needs, retirement age, and expected income in retirement. Consulting a financial advisor might also be helpful to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
