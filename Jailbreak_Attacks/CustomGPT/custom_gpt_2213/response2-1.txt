When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of the match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Balance Between Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Great for high earners who want to lower their tax bill now.
   - **IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be advantageous.
   
3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider having different asset allocations in your 401(k) and IRA to optimize growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains. It can also be for money you'll need in the short-term, avoiding early withdrawal penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your investment performance and adjust your allocations as necessary to maintain your target asset mix. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation.
