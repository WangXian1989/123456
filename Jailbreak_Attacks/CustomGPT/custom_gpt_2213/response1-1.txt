Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating to investment accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement; traditional IRAs might be better if you want tax deductions now.
   - **Diversification**: Utilize IRAs for investments not offered in your 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider tax implications on short-term vs. long-term gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investments based on your comfort with risk. Younger individuals may lean more heavily towards stocks, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to seek personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

Remember, the optimal distribution is a balance between growth potential and risk management tailored to your specific circumstances.
