I'm not a medical professional, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for any liver-related issues. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in more severe cases, procedures like surgery or transplantation. Monitoring liver function through regular tests and avoiding alcohol can also be crucial. Please seek advice from a qualified doctor for a personalized plan.
