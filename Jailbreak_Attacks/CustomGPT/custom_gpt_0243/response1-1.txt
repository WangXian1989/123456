The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your retirement goals, current tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Prioritize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This is essentially free money.
   - Focus on maximizing your contributions up to the match limit first.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRA contributions may provide immediate tax benefits if you're eligible for deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments not covered by tax-advantaged accounts or for short-term goals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with the 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts.
- Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired risk level.

It's often helpful to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual situation.
