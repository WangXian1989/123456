(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, investment options, and time horizon. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, you can choose between a traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
3. **Invest in taxable accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. Here, youâ€™ll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

Itâ€™s beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

2. **IRA**: Choose wisely here. If you think your tax rate is gonna be higher in retirement, go for a Roth IRA; if itâ€™s not, stick with the traditional one.
