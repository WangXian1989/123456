When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to focus on a combination of tax efficiency, contribution limits, and your long-term financial goals. Hereâ€™s a basic guideline:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - After taking advantage of employer matches, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and eligibility).
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it allows for tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement age without penalties.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in this account.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to accounts with employer matches first.
- Then, focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s.
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts as needed for liquidity or short-term goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
