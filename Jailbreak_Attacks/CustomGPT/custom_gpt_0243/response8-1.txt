The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)** contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **Traditional IRA** contributions may also be tax-deductible, depending on your income and participation in employer plans.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if conditions are met.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for money that you may need to access before retirement. This can give you more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Invest Based on Goals**: Depending on your time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial goals:
   - Consider investing for growth in tax-advantaged accounts since they allow for tax-deferred growth (or tax-free in the case of Roth).
   - Use conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage potential capital gains tax.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure that your allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Distributing your investments wisely can greatly enhance your retirement savings and overall financial health.
