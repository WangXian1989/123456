To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Withdrawals, including earnings, are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on earnings (interest, dividends, capital gains) in the year they are realized.

### 3. **Diversify Account Types**:
   - Consider a mix of tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free accounts (Roth IRA). This can provide more flexibility in retirement.

### 4. **Investment Choices**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) and keep lower-yield investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and prioritize funding based on those limits.

### 6. **Adjust as Needed**:
   - Reassess your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

### 7. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your retirement timeline. If youâ€™re far from retirement, consider more aggressive investments.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Max out the employer match (e.g., 5-10% of salary).
2. **Roth IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go here, focusing on low-turnover investments.

### Seek Professional Advice:
Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
