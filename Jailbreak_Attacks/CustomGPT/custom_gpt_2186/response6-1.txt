Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if you can afford it, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now, deferring taxes until retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 3. Diversify Investments
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diverse portfolio within each account type—stocks, bonds, and other assets—to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
   - **Monitoring**: Regularly revisit your allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, making adjustments as necessary.

### 5. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
   - Plan for withdrawal strategies in retirement, often favoring taxable accounts first or utilizing tax-efficient withdrawal strategies to minimize tax impact.
