Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider if you want to invest in a traditional 401(k) (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth 401(k) (after-tax contributions).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Tax Treatments**: Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts after maxing out retirement accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Consider holding investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Prioritize**: 401(k) contributions up to the employer match → IRA contributions → 401(k) contributions to the max → then taxable accounts.
2. **Asset Allocation**: Keep tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and higher-taxed bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Considerations:
- Regularly review your asset allocation based on age, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
