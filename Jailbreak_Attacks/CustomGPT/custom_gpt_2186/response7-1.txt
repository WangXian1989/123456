Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**
   - **Short-term needs:** Money you may need within 1-3 years should go into accessible accounts (like a savings account or taxable accounts).
   - **Long-term growth:** Funds for retirement or long-term goals can be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - If you have a 401(k), contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Max out contributions, particularly if you get a match. Contributions are often pretax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawal). The choice depends on your current vs. future tax expectations.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within your accounts to manage risk.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for additional investments once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your distribution strategy annually or as your financial situation changes.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out employee contribution limit, prioritize employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the maximum limit based on eligibility.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings here, focusing on long-term growth.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
- Consider meeting with a financial planner to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

This balanced approach will help you leverage the benefits of each account type effectively while preparing for your financial future.
