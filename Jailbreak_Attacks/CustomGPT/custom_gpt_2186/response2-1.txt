Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a thoughtful strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically has higher contribution limits and employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible for withdrawals but subject to capital gains taxes. Useful for short-term goals or investments.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
   - Then, consider maxing out an IRA if eligible.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate high income or for short-term needs.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Longer-term goals can be more aggressive.
   - Diversify investments across accounts according to your risk profile.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Utilize taxable accounts first for flexibility, then use 401(k) and IRA balances strategically to manage tax implications.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Revisit and adjust your distribution regularly based on performance, life changes, and tax law adjustments.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions (max out match)
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 25% of contributions (max out if eligible)
- **Taxable Account:** 25% of contributions

This strategy can be tailored based on individual circumstances. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
