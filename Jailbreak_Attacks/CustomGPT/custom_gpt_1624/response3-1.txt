Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**

- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
  
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible traditional IRA contributions or Roth IRA benefits.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**

- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal. Prioritize these for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to maximize tax benefits.

- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that yield lower tax rates, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains. Consider stocks and index funds, which can be more tax-efficient.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**

- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate based on how much risk you’re willing to take. Generally, you can afford to take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts.

- **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

### 4. **Withdrawal Planning**

- **Age Considerations**: As you approach retirement, start shifting towards more conservative investments, especially in accounts you’ll tap first.

- **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Be mindful of RMDs in your 401(k) and traditional IRA starting at age 73.

### 5. **Regular Review**

- Regularly assess and balance your portfolio based on changing goals, market conditions, and performance.

### Conclusion

A balanced portfolio that leverages tax-advantaged accounts optimally while using taxable accounts judiciously can help you achieve long-term financial success. Consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation is also advisable.
