Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a framework to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. 
     - **Roth IRA**: Offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Provides tax deductions now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.

### 3. **Beyond Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts. These are flexible but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts and finally tax-free accounts in retirement.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

### Additional Tips
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before aggressive investing.
- **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debts before investing heavily.

This approach balances tax efficiency and flexibility, setting you up for a secure financial future.
