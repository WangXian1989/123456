Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**

- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
  
- **IRA:** Once you've secured the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Diversification of Investments**

- **401(k):** Typically offers limited investment options. Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and target-date funds based on your risk tolerance.

- **IRA:** You may have a broader range of investment choices. This flexibility can help you further diversify.

- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains, dividends, or interest. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liabilities.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**

- **Long-Term Goals:** If you're saving for retirement, prioritize contributions toward your 401(k) and IRAs where funds can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have enough in liquid assets (such as a savings account) before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**

- As your financial situation changes, regularly review and rebalance your accounts to ensure you’re meeting your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**

- If you’re unsure how to balance your contributions, consider seeking personalized advice from a financial planner who can provide tailored recommendations based on your unique situation.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax advantages and work toward your financial goals effectively.
