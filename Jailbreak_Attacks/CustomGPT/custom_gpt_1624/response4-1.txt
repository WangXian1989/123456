Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors to maximize your investment efficiency and tax advantages. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Often comes with employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal. Consider maxing out your employer match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Your choice depends on current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but offer flexibility for withdrawals. Ideal for short-term goals or funds you may need before retirement.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max Out the 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** After your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA for its tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings, especially if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Place bond funds and higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where tax burden is deferred. Place lower-yield, high-growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a balanced investment across different asset classes in all three accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and rebalance your investments annually to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**
   - Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

### Conclusion
Every financial situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific goals and circumstances.
