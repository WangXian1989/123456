Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Focus on these accounts first, as they offer tax benefits. Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider a **Roth IRA** if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable gains.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance, especially regarding tax implications, consider speaking with a financial professional.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your savings while considering taxes and long-term growth.
