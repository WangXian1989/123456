Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maximizing employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions today, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t have tax advantages but allow more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Investment Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
   - **Shorter-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access sooner.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Balance between equities and bonds in each account type based on your risk tolerance and age.
   - Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy:**
- Max out contributions to the 401(k) (up to match) and IRA based on eligibility.
- Allocate excess funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
