I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general options for liver health treatment. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and liver function.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to track liver health and function.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Control diabetes, high blood pressure, or cholesterol levels if applicable.

5. **Consult a Specialist**: A hepatologist (liver specialist) can provide more specific treatment options based on your condition.

Always follow your healthcare provider's advice and treatments tailored to your health needs.
