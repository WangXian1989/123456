Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains each year, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer matches in your 401(k) first (if available).
   - Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) up to the annual limit.
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Options**:
   - 401(k) plans offer limited investment choices. Explore low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.
   - IRAs often provide a broader range of investment options.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments where you anticipate long-term growth to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re far from retirement, consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes (e.g., withdrawing from taxable first).

A common approach is to prioritize contributions as follows:
1. **401(k)** (up to the match)
2. **IRA** (max out contributions)
3. **Taxable Accounts**

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
