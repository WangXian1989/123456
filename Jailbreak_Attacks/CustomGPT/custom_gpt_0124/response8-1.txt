Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential pre-tax contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider equities for growth in retirement accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Annually**: Review your distribution strategy regularly to adjust for changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to get personalized advice for your specific situation.
