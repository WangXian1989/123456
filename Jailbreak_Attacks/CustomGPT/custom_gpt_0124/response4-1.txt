Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some tips:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Contribute to the maximum limit if possible, but consider your overall financial situation and other obligations.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If your income allows, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use after-tax investments for flexibility. You can withdraw contributions anytime without penalties.
   - Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, to minimize tax burden.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Review your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance.
   - Balance your investments across accounts to optimize tax efficiency.
   - Reassess regularly as your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
