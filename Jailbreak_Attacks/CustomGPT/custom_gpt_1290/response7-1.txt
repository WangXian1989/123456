It's essential to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your situation). This can provide additional tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This will provide you with more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments based on your risk tolerance and goals. Generally, you might hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth, and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances.
