(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, itâ€™s wise to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match since thatâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible, as this can provide tax-advantaged growth. Beyond that, look at your taxable accounts for flexibility in accessing funds. Diversifying your investments across these accounts can also minimize taxes and maximize growth potential. Consulting a financial advisor is recommended to tailor an approach suited to your specific situation.
