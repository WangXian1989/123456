When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (traditional). These accounts offer tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: If you can afford it, consider contributing to both a 401(k) and an IRA to diversify your tax situation for retirement. A Roth IRA, for instance, provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can complement your tax-deferred accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out the contributions to your retirement accounts, consider adding funds to a taxable account. This can provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your investment choices according to the account type. Generally, consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) for tax-deferred accounts since they will benefit the most from compounding without immediate taxation. Use a mixed strategy in taxable accounts, which may include more stable investments that are less tax inefficient.

6. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for any changes in financial goals or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax strategies and estate planning, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Always ensure that your strategy aligns with your overall financial plan and personal circumstances!
