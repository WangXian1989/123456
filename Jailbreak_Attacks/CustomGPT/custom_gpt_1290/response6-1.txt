To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts**: Both 401(k) and IRA contributions may reduce your taxable income in the contributing year, but withdrawals will be taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax. Long-term investments may benefit from lower rates.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Fully contribute to your 401(k) up to your employer's match limit first. This is essentially "free money" and a guaranteed return on your investment.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Allocate funds to the IRA after reaching the employer match in the 401(k) to take advantage of potential tax benefits and compound growth.
   - Use your taxable account for investments that may generate capital gains, as these can be managed for tax efficiency.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re younger and have a longer investment horizon, consider aggressive growth investments in tax-deferred accounts.
   - As you near retirement, gradually shift towards more stable investments, reducing exposure in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your income, investment goals, and market conditions. This can help to maintain your desired risk level.

By evaluating these factors and strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize your financial growth while minimizing your tax liabilities.
