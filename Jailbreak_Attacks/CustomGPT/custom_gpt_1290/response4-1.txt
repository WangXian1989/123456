When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider a few key factors: your financial goals, your current tax situation, and the investment options available in each account. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you're more focused on long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, your tax situation will vary. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contributing to an IRA can be a great way to reduce your taxable income.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. Contributing to a traditional 401(k) or IRA can lower your taxable income now, while Roth options are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Within your accounts, diversify your investments to manage risk and capitalize on different market segments. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets will help stabilize your overall portfolio.

4. **Emergency Savings**: 
   - Ensure you have adequate emergency savings outside of these accounts, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties and taxes if you access them before retirement age.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for greater flexibility. These accounts can be more suitable for funds you might need access to before retirement or for specific financial goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review and rebalance your investment allocations periodically to ensure they align with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - Given the complexities of tax law and investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor may provide tailored advice based on your unique financial situation.

These steps can help you create a balanced distribution of funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, ultimately working towards your financial goals.
