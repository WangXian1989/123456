Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be a significant advantage if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that produce less taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, to minimize tax liability.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquidity for emergencies. This should be in a savings account or easily accessible funds rather than your retirement accounts.

5. **Debt Management**: Before heavy investment, consider paying off high-interest debt, which often yields a better "return" than most investments.

6. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to mitigate risk.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
