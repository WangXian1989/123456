Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum limit if possible, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions depending on your income.

2. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), you might allocate more funds to tax-advantaged accounts. Since these accounts often have penalties for early withdrawals, they’re better suited for funds you don’t need access to until retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement. These accounts offer more flexibility but come with tax implications on gains.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks have higher returns over the long term but come with greater risk. Bonds tend to be more stable but may offer lower returns.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can tailor a plan specific to your financial situation, goals, and tax circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual circumstances and goals.
