Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
  
### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. This allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing a Roth IRA might be wise, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Investment Growth Potential**
   - Use **taxable accounts** for investments expected to generate significant taxable income, such as bonds or REITs, and reserve the 401(k) and IRA for more growth-oriented investments (like stocks) since they offer tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for **diversified withdrawals** in retirement. Having money in all three account types can allow you to adapt your withdrawals to your tax situation.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of total income, enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out contributions if you can (up to $6,500/year or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate the remainder for flexible access and investment opportunities.

### Final Considerations:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals. 
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
