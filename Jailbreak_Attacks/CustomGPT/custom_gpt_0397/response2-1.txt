Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions, often with employer matching. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Offers tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but offer flexibility; taxes on dividends and capital gains apply.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Once you get the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Hold bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to shelter interest income.
   - Use taxable accounts for equities to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation among stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your target asset mix.

### 7. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

### Conclusion
A mix of maximizing contributions, understanding tax implications, and maintaining diversification will help you effectively distribute your money among these accounts for long-term growth. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your situation.
