Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing this out next if you have a high income and want to reduce your taxable income. Also, look into whether your 401(k) offers a Roth option.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts, focusing on long-term investments that generate qualified dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Consider Your Goals**: If you need funds in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts to avoid penalties and taxes on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice.
