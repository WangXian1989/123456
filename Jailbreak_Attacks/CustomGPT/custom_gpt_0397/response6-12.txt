   - **Diet:** A balanced diet low in fat and sugar can help reduce liver strain.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity supports liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids:** May be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to assess liver function.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements:**
