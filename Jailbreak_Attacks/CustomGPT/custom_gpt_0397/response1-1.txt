To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider funding taxable accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergency funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Favor growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, where gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding lower-growth assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) here to minimize tax implications, as capital gains and dividends are taxed.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement strategically to minimize taxes, using tax-deferred accounts first, then taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
