Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is free money.
   - **Consider High-Interest Debt**: If you have significant debt, you might prioritize paying that down before maxing out contributions.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose based on your current tax rate versus expected rate in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.
   - **Annual Limits**: Make sure to contribute up to the annual limit ($6,500 for 2024, with an extra $1,000 catch-up if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and no penalties for withdrawals. Use them for shorter-term goals or if you've maxed out retirement accounts.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds, to minimize taxable gains.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Prioritize 401(k) to the match**, then contribute to an IRA.
2. **Max out the IRA** if eligible.
3. **Fill up your 401(k)** to the maximum limit.
4. Use any remaining funds for **taxable investments**.

### Considerations:
- Evaluate your **risk tolerance** and investment strategy for each account type, aligning them with your goals.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This diversified approach balances growth, tax benefits, and liquidity based on your current and future needs.
