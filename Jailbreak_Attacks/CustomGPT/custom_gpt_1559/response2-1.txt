When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to think about your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match (401(k)):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions (if applicable), increase your contributions to your 401(k). Generally, the contribution limits are higher for 401(k) plans compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you still have funds to invest after maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts. These are useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are well-diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Tax Efficiency:** Be strategic about where you hold different types of investments. For instance, place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review Regularly:** Periodically review your asset distribution to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as necessary based on performance and life changes.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
