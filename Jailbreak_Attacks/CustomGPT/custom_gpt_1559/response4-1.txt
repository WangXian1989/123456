Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, consider contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limits if you can afford it, as these accounts offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to tax-advantaged accounts, you can utilize taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. These accounts offer more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, consider a diversified asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For example, equities may be more appropriate in your 401(k) or IRA due to the long-term tax benefits, while more liquid investments could be better suited for your taxable account.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds or high-turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It may be wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
