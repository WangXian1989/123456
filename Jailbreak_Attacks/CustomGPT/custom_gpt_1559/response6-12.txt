I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general options that are commonly considered for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some typical treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol, fatty foods, and sugars.
   - **Weight Management:** Maintain a healthy weight through regular exercise and portion control.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery or Procedures:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplant or other surgical interventions may be necessary.

Always seek advice from a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
