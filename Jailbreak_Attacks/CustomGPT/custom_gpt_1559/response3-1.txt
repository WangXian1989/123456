The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are typically tax-deferred (traditional options) or tax-free (Roth options). Traditional accounts reduce your taxable income for the year you contribute, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider the tax implications of trading frequently.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account.

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: 
   - If you’re investing for retirement (long-term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - If you have shorter-term goals (like buying a house), consider your taxable accounts since you can access those funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Ensure that the overall portfolio is properly diversified.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Ultimately, it might be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that best suits your unique situation and goals.
