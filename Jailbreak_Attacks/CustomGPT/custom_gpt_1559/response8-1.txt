The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Max out contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) if they offer a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing enough to take full advantage of any employer match before allocating to other accounts.
   - Check the fees and investment options in your plan.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and might be beneficial for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate higher future tax rates, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account for more flexibility.
   - Taxable accounts allow access to funds without penalty before retirement age and can hold a variety of investments.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and account types to mitigate risks and optimize returns. 
   - Keep track of tax implications for selling investments within taxable accounts, particularly when taking dividends or capital gains.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age or specific investment objectives (e.g., buying a house).
   - Consider your risk tolerance when choosing investments in each account.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to develop a strategy that fits your specific situation.
