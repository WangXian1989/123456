Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you’re in a high tax bracket for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Fund an IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, but be mindful of taxes upon withdrawal.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Invest leftover funds in taxable accounts for short-term goals or greater liquidity.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Risk Assessment:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

5. **Tax Strategies:**
   - Harvest tax losses in taxable accounts to offset gains.
   - Be aware of tax implications when withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts in retirement.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically reassess your portfolio and allocate funds based on performance and changes in financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
