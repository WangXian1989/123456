Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full amount. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
### 3. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For money youâ€™ll need in the next few years, prioritize your taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on retirement accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for tax advantages and growth potential.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) here.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use 401(k) and IRAs for tax-efficient investing since you can defer taxes on gains.

### 5. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Choose a balanced mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance across all accounts to manage overall portfolio risk.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of income (up to the match)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for 2024; $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder of your investment funds

### Conclusion
Tailor these suggestions to fit your unique circumstances. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized planning to optimize your distribution strategy.
