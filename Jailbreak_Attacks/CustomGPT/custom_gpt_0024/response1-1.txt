Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Focus on long-term growth assets, like stocks or mutual funds, since these accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks here because they might generate taxable income, which can be more tax-efficient in a tax-advantaged account.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: You’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement, so consider your future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; long-term holdings are usually taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have liquid savings outside these accounts for emergencies, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically evaluate your asset allocation and adjust contributions as needed, based on market performance and your retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Tailoring your distribution strategy depends on your personal situation, so consider consulting a financial advisor to optimize based on your specific needs and risk tolerance.
