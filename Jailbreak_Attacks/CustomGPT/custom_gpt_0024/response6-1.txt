Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Pros**: Immediate return on investment.
   - **Action**: Contribute enough to get the full match if available.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Action**: After employer match, consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **When**: If youâ€™ve maxed out retirement accounts and want more investment flexibility.
   - **Benefits**: Easier access to funds and potential for capital gains.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Mix**: Use a combination of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds across all accounts for balanced risk.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Strategy**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

### 7. **Review & Adjust Regularly**
   - **Action**: Annually assess your distribution based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions based on these principles can optimize your retirement savings while managing tax implications effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
