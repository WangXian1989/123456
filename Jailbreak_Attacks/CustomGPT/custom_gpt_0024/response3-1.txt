Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s free money!

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, prioritize contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax situation:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; good for higher income now, lower in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; great for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Taxes**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient, like stock funds that generate qualified dividends.
   - Avoid high turnover or heavily taxed investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Evaluate Regularly**:
   - Revisit your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Consider your current and future tax brackets** before deciding how much to allocate to each account type.
- **Think about liquidity needs**—funds in taxable accounts can be accessed more easily than retirement accounts without penalties.
- **Consult a financial advisor** for personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

By following this approach, you can create a balanced portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing taxes over the long term.
