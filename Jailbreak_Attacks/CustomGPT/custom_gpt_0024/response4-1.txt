To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for possible tax deductions.

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - Use the 401(k) and IRAs for long-term retirement saving, focusing on growth vehicles (stocks).
   - Allocate to taxable accounts for short-term needs or if you anticipate needing the funds earlier.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Consider holding investments with favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk while aligning with your overall investment strategy.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio as market conditions and your life situation change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific goals and tax situation.

This allocation strategy can help maximize growth and minimize taxes. Always tailor your approach based on individual financial circumstances.
