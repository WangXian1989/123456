Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it's essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Roth IRA** (if eligible):
   - If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**:
   - If you still have money to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and Roth IRA, consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 4. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If you’re aiming for higher savings, max out your 401(k) to take advantage of tax deferral.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are not tax-advantaged or if you've reached the contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

### 6. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance and when you plan to access the funds.

### 7. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
