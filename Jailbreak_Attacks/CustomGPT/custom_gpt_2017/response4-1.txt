Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for potential tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for intermediate-term goals where you may need access to funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate across various asset classes based on your risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your distribution based on market performance and life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 50% of total contributions (maximizing match)
- **IRA**: 30% of total contributions (mix of traditional and Roth as suitable)
- **Taxable Account**: 20% for liquidity and flexibility

Tailor these percentages to fit your specific financial goals and situation.
