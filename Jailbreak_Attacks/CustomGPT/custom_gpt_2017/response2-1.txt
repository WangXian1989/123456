Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (a good return on investment). If you can, aim to max out contributions, as these contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income, you might want to prioritize Roth contributions if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider the taxable account for investments that you may want to access before retirement. This can include stocks or ETFs that minimize capital gains tax.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments align with your risk tolerance and timeline. Stocks are often better suited for growth over time, while bonds can provide stability.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your allocations across accounts and rebalance as needed. This ensures that you stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you are unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

### Summary
Prioritize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, carefully consider your investment strategy for each type of account, and regularly review your allocations to meet your long-term financial goals.
