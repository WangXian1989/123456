I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Common approaches to liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can help. Increasing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is beneficial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and support weight management.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Avoid Toxins**:
   - Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption and avoid exposure to harmful substances that can exacerbate liver issues.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect changes early.

Always discuss these options with your healthcare provider for tailored advice.
