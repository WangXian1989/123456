To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - Ensure you're maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - For 2024, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $23,000, and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on tax-deferred growth. This is ideal for high-growth investments since taxes will be owed upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k) in tax treatment; consider placing bonds or income-generating assets here for tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, benefiting from lower tax rates. Prioritize investments that result in minimal tax implications.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Use a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, consider drawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Use strategic withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts when in a lower tax bracket, potentially minimizing taxes.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
