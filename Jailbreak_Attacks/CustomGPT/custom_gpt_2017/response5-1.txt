(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

3. **Balance for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investment flexibility, as funds can be accessed without penalties. This is important if you might need to withdraw funds before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your asset allocation annually to respond to market changes and your evolving retirement needs.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! Hereâ€™s how to juggle your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a pro:

1. **401(k) First, Baby**: If your job offers a 401(k) match, dive in! Thatâ€™s free cash! Throw in enough to max out the match right off the bat.

2. **IRA Time**: Next, hit up your IRA. If youâ€™re looking at retirement and believe taxes will be higher then, a Roth IRA is your pal. Just be aware of the income limits, or you might be singing the "Traditional IRA Blues."

3. **Taxable Accounts for Fun**: Now, for your taxable accounts! Think of this as your playground. You can grab those funds whenever you want without that pesky 10% penalty (just watch out for capital gains). 

4. **Spread the Love**: Diversify like itâ€™s hot! Mix up your investments across all accounts to keep things spicy and mitigate risks.

5. **Check Up Regularly**: Donâ€™t be that person who forgets about their portfolio! Rebalance it at least once a year to keep your investments aligned with your goals. Keep that money working for you!

So, get to it, and donâ€™t let your money sit around doing nothing!
