Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your growth over time.

3. **Focus on 401(k)**: If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. These contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Consider keeping higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure you stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
