Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and manage tax implications effectively. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After securing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you can, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit next. This offers high contribution limits and tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less tax burden, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. Consider keeping more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consider your Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw funds. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

Always consult a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation for personalized advice.
