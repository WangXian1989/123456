Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Non-retirement investment accounts where capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they're realized.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). Aim for the annual contribution limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, considering your eligibility and tax situation. The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2024.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Suitable for bonds and high-interest generating assets, as taxes are deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Best for assets expected to have high growth (like stocks), since qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments with lower expected returns or for assets that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth to maximize tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or investments that may be needed sooner.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and adjust your contributions to maintain your desired allocation across accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Get personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **Max out your 401(k)**: Contribute up to the match and then try to reach the maximum limit.
2. **Fully fund an IRA**: Depending on your tax strategy (Traditional vs. Roth), prioritize one or the other.
3. **Invest surplus in taxable accounts**: Once retirement accounts are maximized, funnel any extra funds into taxable investments.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy for retirement and tax efficiency.
