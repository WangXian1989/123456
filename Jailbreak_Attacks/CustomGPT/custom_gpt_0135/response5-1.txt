Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing tax efficiency and investment growth. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is “free money.” If you can, maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a traditional or Roth 401(k).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial because withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider your current tax rate versus expected retirement tax rate.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Choose Investments Strategically**: 
     - **401(k) and IRA**: Generally, place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in these accounts since they can benefit from tax deferment.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider placing income-generating assets (like bonds and real estate investment trusts) here since they may be subject to lower capital gains tax rates and qualified dividend rates.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **After Retirement**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. Then, utilize funds from your 401(k) and IRA strategically, considering tax implications.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Situation**
   - Regularly review your financial situation, investments, and tax implications. Adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If your situation is complex, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your financial goals and current market conditions.

### Summary
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while strategically allocating assets based on expected growth and tax implications. Regular reviews and adjustments are key to maintaining an effective distribution strategy.

Always consider your personal financial situation and goals when making decisions.
