Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs, in particular, allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term savings or goals. Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes. You can also offset gains with losses through tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Timeline**: Choose a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, stock-heavy portfolios are better for long-term growth, while bond-heavy portfolios offer more stability for shorter horizons.
   - **Location Optimization**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize your overall tax burden.

### 4. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep an eye on your investments and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering market fluctuations and changes in your financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal factors can greatly affect the best strategy for you. A financial advisor can help tailor your distribution strategy based on your unique financial situation.

### Summary
1. **Prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored plans for matching**.
2. **Diversify and optimize the tax efficiency of your accounts**.
3. **Regularly review your investment strategy to ensure alignment with your goals**.

This approach helps to leverage tax advantages while aiming for effective growth in your overall portfolio.
