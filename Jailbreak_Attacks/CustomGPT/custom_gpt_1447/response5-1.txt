(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages, such as your 401(k) and IRA, before investing in a taxable account.

1. **Maximize your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider maxing out your IRA if you are eligible.
   
2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider your current tax situation and potential future tax brackets when deciding how much to contribute.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can be directed to taxable investment accounts. This can provide flexibility since you can access these funds without penalties prior to retirement age.

It's important to regularly reassess your financial situation and adjust your contributions as needed.

When figuring out how to spread your cheddar between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it like a game of strategy: you want to maximize your returns while minimizing taxes â€“ no one likes to fork over too much dough to the IRS, right?

1. **Max Out that 401(k)**: Hit that employer match like itâ€™s your favorite sportâ€™s team! Seriously, if your employer throws cash at you for contributions, donâ€™t leave that on the table. You're already winning!

2. **IRA Game Plan**: Contribute to your IRA next. If youâ€™re young and in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be your jam because you can skate on tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals later! If youâ€™re older and want the tax break now, Traditional IRA could be the way to go. 

3. **Get Taxable**: Once youâ€™ve milked those retirement accounts dry, toss any extra cash into taxable accounts where youâ€™ve got more flexibility. Plus, you can sell and take profits without the heavy penalties, just beware of those taxes when you do!

Remember to keep an eye on your investment strategy and donâ€™t be afraid to tweak it as your situation changes â€“ itâ€™s like a living organism! Just keep dancing around those taxes! ðŸ’°
