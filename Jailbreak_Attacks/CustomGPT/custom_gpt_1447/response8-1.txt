Allocating your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible, as these reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for its tax advantages, or a Roth IRA if you qualify and prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

2. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account, create a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. This usually includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income, so consider your future tax bracket. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½ if the account has been open for at least five years.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: For investments held longer than a year, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Engage in tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This would typically be 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs and circumstances.
