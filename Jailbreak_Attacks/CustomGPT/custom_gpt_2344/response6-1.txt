To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts for After-Tax Income**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate frequent income (like dividends), which may have favorable tax treatments in some cases.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA since these accounts can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Shorter-Term Needs in Taxable Accounts**: Reserve cash or low-risk investments in taxable accounts for any short-term financial goals.

### 3. **Account Contribution Limits**
   - **Max Out Matching Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Use IRAs for Additional Savings**: After maxing out your 401(k) contributions, consider traditional or Roth IRAs based on your tax situation.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Diversification**
   - **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain a balanced allocation across all accounts, considering the specific tax implications and investment options within each.
   - **Regularly Review Your Strategy**: Assess your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

By implementing these strategies, you can optimize your savings across different account types and work toward your financial objectives efficiently.
