Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions). A Roth might be preferable if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay within the annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, plus $1,000 catch-up if youâ€™re over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Ideal for savings meant for short-term goals, as funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains distributions.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses set aside.
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice, as they can tailor a specific strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.
