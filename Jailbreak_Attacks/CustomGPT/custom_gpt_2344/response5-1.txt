(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (especially if it's a Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation) after maximizing the 401(k) match.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility regarding withdrawals and may provide lower capital gains taxes on long-term investments.
4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Different accounts can hold different types of investments. For example, consider placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

Itâ€™s also wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.
