To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred, employer matching options, higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Tax advantages, with traditional and Roth options impacting withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility, no contribution limits, but subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your time horizon (short vs. long term) and risk tolerance.

3. **Contribution Priorities**:
   - **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Free money is crucial.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider Roth for tax-free withdrawals, or traditional for upfront tax deduction.
   - **Invest excess funds in taxable accounts**: Use for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify**: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance.
   - **Tax-efficient investing**: Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations based on changes in income, market performance, and retirement goals.

Implementing these strategies will help you maximize your investment while managing taxes effectively.
