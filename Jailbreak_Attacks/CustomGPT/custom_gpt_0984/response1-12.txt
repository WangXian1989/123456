I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional about liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition, such as liver disease or hepatitis. Common treatments may include medication, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and in some cases, more advanced interventions like surgery. Always make sure to follow medical advice tailored to your situation.
