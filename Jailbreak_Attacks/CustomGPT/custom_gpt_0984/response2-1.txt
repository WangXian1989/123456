To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; then consider maximizing your contributions.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, also contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Understand Your Goals**:
   - Short-term savings (1-3 years): Focus on taxable accounts for easier access.
   - Medium-term (3-10 years): Consider a mix of taxable accounts and IRAs.
   - Long-term (10+ years): Max out tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid assets (bonds, REITs) to balance your tax exposure.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating investments, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your allocation annually based on your financial goals, age, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider speaking with a financial planner.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for your investments.
