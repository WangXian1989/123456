To help you effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Decide based on your current vs. expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds here will be taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so they can be a good place for more tax-efficient investments.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your short-term versus long-term goals. Funds for retirement should be more aggressively invested in tax-advantaged accounts, while more liquid needs can be addressed in taxable accounts.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind the accessibility of funds. Taxable accounts allow for easier withdrawals without penalties, unlike IRAs and 401(k)s, which have restrictions before age 59½.

### Recommended Allocation Strategy:

- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Fill the 401(k)**: After contributing to your IRA, continue maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
- **Taxable Account for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or investments once you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts.

### Example Scenario:

1. **$20,000 in total savings to allocate**
   - **401(k)**: $8,000 (to get full employer match)
   - **IRA**: $6,000 (max contribution)
   - **Taxable Account**: $6,000 (for flexibility and investment options)

Make sure to review your overall financial plan periodically and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and your personal circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor could also provide tailored advice based on your situation.
