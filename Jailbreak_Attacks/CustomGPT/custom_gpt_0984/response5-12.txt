I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general options typically recommended for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can greatly benefit liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests are crucial to monitor liver function and assess treatment effectiveness.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always reach out to a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
