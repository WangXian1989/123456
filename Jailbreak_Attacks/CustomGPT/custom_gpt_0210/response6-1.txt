To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate little taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these for high growth investments like stocks, as gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Plan withdrawals** based on projected tax implications. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and personal financial goals to maintain your desired risk level.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and focusing on a balanced, efficient asset allocation, you can optimize your overall returns and tax efficiency.
