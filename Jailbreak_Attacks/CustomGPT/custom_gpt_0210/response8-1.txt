Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this first if your employer offers a match. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing. Address any high-interest debt.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Invest for growth (stocks, mutual funds) if you have a long time until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or if you need access before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Stay aware of contribution limits for each account type to optimize contributions.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices. 

This balanced approach can help optimize your retirement savings while managing tax efficiency.
