Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contribution here if you are eligible for tax deductions (Traditional IRA) or if you prefer tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

### 2. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in cash or a high-yield savings account before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account. This allows for greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Equities**: Favor stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.
   - **Bonds/High-Yield Investments**: Consider holding these in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### 6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Adjust contributions based on your projected tax rates in retirement; this could affect whether you choose Traditional or Roth options.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
