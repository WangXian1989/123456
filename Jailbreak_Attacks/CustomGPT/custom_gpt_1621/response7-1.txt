To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA Accounts**: Contributions to these accounts often come with tax benefits (e.g., pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income). However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax when you sell your investments, so managing turnover and holding periods can minimize taxes.

2. **Prioritize Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is free money.
   - Consider contribution limits for IRAs ($6,000 per year for individuals under 50, or $7,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older in 2023).
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of equity and fixed-income investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Consider a diverse set of investments that may not be available in your 401(k), such as individual stocks, bonds, or alternative investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover rates and can minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid funds in a savings account or similar before aggressively investing in your retirement accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically reevaluate your investment strategy based on changes in your financial situation, risk appetite, and market conditions to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
