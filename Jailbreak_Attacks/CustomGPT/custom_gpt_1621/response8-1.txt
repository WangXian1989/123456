The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income now.

3. **Tax Implications:** Keep in mind the tax implications of each account. Taxable accounts can be taxed on capital gains and dividends, while tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) grow tax-deferred or tax-free (for Roth accounts).

4. **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before focusing heavily on these investments. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Diversification Strategy:** Allocate your investments in different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across your accounts to manage risk and potentially enhance returns. 

6. **Adjust Contributions Based on Fees:** If your 401(k) has high fees, it may be more beneficial to prioritize your IRA or taxable accounts for investment.

7. **Monitor and Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review your investment distribution and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Lastly, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, helping you make informed decisions.

These steps will help you build a strategic approach to distributing your money effectively.
