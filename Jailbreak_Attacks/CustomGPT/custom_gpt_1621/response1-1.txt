Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The higher contribution limits compared to IRAs can be beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into a taxable account. This is also a good option if you want more flexibility with your investments and access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes, while retirement accounts offer tax-advantaged growth. Be mindful of where to place investments that may generate taxable income.

6. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to help manage risk.

7. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so it’s important to review and adjust your allocations as necessary.
