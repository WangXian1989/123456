Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Use these for more flexible access to funds.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Often limited to a selection of funds. Focus on diversified, low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA:** Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and timeline. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term goals or to hold investments that may generate high capital gains, like stocks.

### 4. **Rebalance as Necessary**
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts regularly and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 40%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Account:** 30%

Adjust these percentages based on your individual needs and financial goals.
