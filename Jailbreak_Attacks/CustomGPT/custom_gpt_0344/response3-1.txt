Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Aim to max out contributions if possible.

### 3. **Fund Your 401(k)**
   - After maximizing any IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for shorter-term goals or after reaching retirement accounts maxes. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g. index funds) to minimize tax implications.

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Hold income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to avoid high tax rates on withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and personal goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

This approach will help you maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
