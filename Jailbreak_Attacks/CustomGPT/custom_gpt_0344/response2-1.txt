Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategy to optimize your investments:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions may reduce your taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so prioritize tax-efficient investments.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a liquid account, typically equivalent to 3-6 months of living expenses.

### 4. **Target Asset Allocation**
   - Decide on your overall asset allocation based on risk tolerance:
     - **Higher Risk**: Consider growth stocks in your taxable account due to long-term capital gains rates.
     - **Bonds/Stable Investments**: Favor these in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on interest income.

### 5. **Tax-Deferred Growth**
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth. 

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations based on performance and changes in goals.

### Example Strategy:
- **1st Priority**: Contribute to the 401(k) up to the match.
- **2nd Priority**: Max out IRA contributions.
- **3rd Priority**: Invest in taxable accounts with excess funds or once you exceed caps on retirement accounts.

### Conclusion
Tailor these strategies to fit your specific financial situation and goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
