To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. Aim to max out contributions to these accounts if possible.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains can be taxed, so consider keeping assets that generate regular income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of asset classes. Stocks typically go in taxable accounts for long-term growth, while bonds might be better housed in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for future withdrawals; tax implications can vary significantly depending on the source of funds.
