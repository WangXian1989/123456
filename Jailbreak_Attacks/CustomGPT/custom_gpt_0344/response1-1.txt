Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect your tax rate to rise; contributions are made with after-tax dollars but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexible investing. They can be beneficial for short-term goals and provide liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it off before investing heavily.

5. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Professional advice can tailor strategies to your specific needs.

### Summary Breakdown:
- **401(k)**: Max out to the employer match.
- **IRA**: Choose based on tax strategy (traditional vs. Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for flexibility and additional investment options.

This balanced approach helps optimize your savings and tax efficiency.
