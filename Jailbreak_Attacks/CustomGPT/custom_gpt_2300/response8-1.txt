To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:** After securing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. If you're eligible for tax-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA, these can help reduce your taxable income.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income in the contribution year. The withdrawals are taxed as income in retirement.
   - **IRA:** With a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth IRA contributions are made after tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any gains are typically taxed, but long-term capital gains rates are usually lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Investment Strategy:** Tailor your investment choices based on the account type. Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments with higher expected returns that may generate significant taxable income (like stocks), while keeping more stable, less tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and retirement goals, rebalancing between accounts as needed.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Maintain an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or similar liquid investment, separate from your investment accounts.

Every individual's financial situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that meets your specific needs and goals. Would you like more detailed information on any particular aspect?
