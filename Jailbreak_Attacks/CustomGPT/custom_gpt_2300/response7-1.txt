To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize tax advantages**: Prioritize contributions to accounts with tax benefits. If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA (if you qualify) for additional tax-deferred growth.

2. **Investment goals**: Assess your investment goals and time horizon. If you're saving for long-term goals like retirement, consider a more aggressive investment strategy in your tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals or if you expect to need the money sooner, keep more conservative investments in your taxable accounts.

3. **Asset location strategy**: Place investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keep lower-yielding assets (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Ongoing contributions**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on your tax situation and changing financial goals. Consider automated contributions to streamline the process and maintain consistency.
