It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money wisely! The best approach often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here’s a concise breakdown to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum if you can afford it, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can lower your taxable income now.
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.
   - These accounts can be useful for short-term savings goals or if you plan to retire early.

**General Tips**:
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline when choosing specific investments within these accounts.
- Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and life changes.
