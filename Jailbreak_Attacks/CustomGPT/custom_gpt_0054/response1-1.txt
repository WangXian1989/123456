Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Consider your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding where to allocate funds.

3. **Prioritize Saving**: If you haven’t contributed to an emergency fund yet, consider doing that before maximizing retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Each account should have a diversified investment strategy, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for investments that generate lower taxes or that you might need to access before retirement age without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep track of your investments across accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan for your personal situation.
