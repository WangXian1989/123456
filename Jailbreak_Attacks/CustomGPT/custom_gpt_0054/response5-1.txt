(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. You can then increase your contributions based on your financial situation.
  
2. **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for investments that are not suitable for a tax-advantaged account, such as certain types of real estate or specific stocks.

In general, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts up to any contribution limits, as they offer significant long-term benefits.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to stash your cash in your accounts is all about that sweet balance of growth and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer is throwing you free money with a match, you better snag it! Itâ€™s like a bonus check just for doing your job. Max that bad boy out as much as you can, and donâ€™t forget about pre-tax vs. Roth options depending on your tax situation.

2. **IRA**: Roll into a Roth IRA if you want tax-free growth, especially younger folks. If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket, traditional IRAs can save you on taxes now, but be ready to pay later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your flexible buddies! Use them for investments you want to sell off before retirement or if youâ€™re eyeing short-term gains. Also, they let you play around with stuff that doesnâ€™t fit into the 401(k) or IRA, like some killer stocks or real estate.

So, start with those tax-advantaged accounts and work your way to the taxable ones. Donâ€™t let Uncle Sam take more than he needs!
