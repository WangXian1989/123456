I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult a healthcare provider for liver issues. They can recommend treatments like medication, lifestyle changes, or even procedures depending on the condition. Managing diet, avoiding alcohol, and regular check-ups are often advised. Always seek personalized medical advice!
