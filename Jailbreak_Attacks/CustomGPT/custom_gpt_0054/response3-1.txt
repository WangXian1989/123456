Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a basic guide to help you decide:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, ensure any high-interest debts are managed or paid off.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Roth or traditional IRA, plan contributions based on your current and expected future tax rates. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they don't have tax advantages, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. These can be useful for short-term goals.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time horizons can typically afford to take on more risk, making stocks a good option for 401(k) and IRAs.
   - For taxable accounts, consider a mix but remember the tax implications of capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversify**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors regardless of the account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
