The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed, especially if you benefit from tax deductions (pre-tax contributions).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it attractive for younger investors.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your asset allocation strategy to balance risk and growth.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts, especially as you approach retirement age.

7. **Regular Review**: Perform regular assessments of your investment strategy and adjust your contributions based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
