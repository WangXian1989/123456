Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general tips:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest funds here after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax impacts.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Longer time horizons may favor more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Short-term goals might be better served with more liquid, taxable accounts.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Higher-income years suggest more emphasis on tax-deferred accounts to lower taxable income.
   - In lower income years, Roth accounts could be advantageous for tax-free growth.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
