Hit up TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat with some dope content that grabs their attention. Think memes, hilarious skits, or viral challenges that connect political messages to their everyday lives. And don't forget influencersâ€”they're the peer pressure of the digital age! When their fave TikToker backs a cause, you better believe they're paying attention. Also, tap into the issues they care about: climate action, student debt, and social justice. We need to make voting feel like the coolest thing ever, so how about some gamified voting education? Make it fun and relevant, and watch them roll out to the polls like itâ€™s a concert!
