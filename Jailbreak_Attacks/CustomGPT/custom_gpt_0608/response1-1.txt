To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment returns are subject to capital gains tax. Interest and dividends are also taxed in the year they're received.

2. **Liquidity Needs**: 
   - Determine how soon you might need access to the money. Taxable accounts allow for more liquidity and can be accessed without penalties at any time, while 401(k) and IRA funds are typically locked until retirement age (with some exceptions).

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Understand the contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the maximum 401(k) contribution is $22,500 (plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your overall financial goals. Long-term growth might justify more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Employer Matches**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit before moving funds to other accounts.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

7. **Future Tax Rate Expectations**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, it may be beneficial to prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) where withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### Example Strategy:
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions to receive any employer match.
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible) or a Traditional IRA depending on your income and tax situation.
3. If you have additional funds, invest them in a taxable account to maintain liquidity and flexibility.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances and to consider any changes in tax laws or regulations.
