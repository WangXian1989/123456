To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA has tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions depending on your income.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial. If you think youâ€™ll be in a lower bracket, contributing to a traditional IRA or 401(k) could be the way to go.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. An appropriate mix can reduce risk and improve returns.

6. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to reduce capital gains taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all three account types to maintain your target asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By strategically distributing your contributions across these accounts while considering tax implications and your personal financial goals, you can optimize your investment strategy for the long term.
