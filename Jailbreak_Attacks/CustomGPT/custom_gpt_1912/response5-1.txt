(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Diversifying your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is key to a balanced financial strategy. Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from employer matches. Next, consider funding your IRA, aiming for a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Finally, use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on tax-efficient funds. The specific allocation should reflect your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals, possibly including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

Then, dive into your IRA; go Roth if you want the sweet tax-free withdrawals later. For taxable accounts, think of them as your playground for riskier investments. Keep it spicy with some ETFs and stocks that are tax-efficient. Balance it based on how much risk you can handle and what your future goals look like. Itâ€™s all about playing the long game while keeping an eye on those tax implications! ðŸ’°ðŸ”¥
