To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Contribution Limits:** 
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. 

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Allocate funds to your IRA next, focusing on a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.

4. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to balance risk.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Adjust your investment mix based on your age and retirement timeline.

6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Revisit your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Seek professional advice to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

This approach helps maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over the long term.
