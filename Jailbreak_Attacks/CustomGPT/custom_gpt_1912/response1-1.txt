Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify, use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Consider a Traditional IRA if you want immediate tax benefits; however, remember taxes on withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for goals that are shorter-term (e.g., buying a house).
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on gains and income.

**General Tips**:
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.
- Regularly assess and rebalance your investments based on market changes and your financial goals.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
