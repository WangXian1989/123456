To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deferment.

2. **Balance Your Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented mutual funds or index funds to benefit from compound growth over time.
   - **IRA**: Select a diversified set of assets, including stocks, bonds, or ETFs, depending on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in your taxable account for emergencies, avoiding penalties from early withdrawals.

4. **Rebalancing Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations periodically based on market performance and changes in your risk tolerance.

This approach helps optimize tax implications and growth potential across your investment accounts.
