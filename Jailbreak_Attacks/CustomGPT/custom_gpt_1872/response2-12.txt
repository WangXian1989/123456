It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. However, common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the progression of the condition.

4. **Weight Management**: If obesity is a factor, weight loss through diet and exercise can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Vaccinations**: Vaccines for hepatitis A and B may be recommended, especially if you're at risk.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases or liver cirrhosis, more invasive treatments, including liver transplant, may be considered.

Always consult your doctor for diagnosis and treatment specific to your situation.
