The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - Depending on your tax situation, you may choose to contribute to a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k), with the former providing tax benefits now and the latter providing tax-free growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.
   - For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if youâ€™re age 50 or older). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. 
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Diversify between stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk effectively.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Emphasize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to reduce capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Reassess and adjust your allocation as needed based on performance, market changes, or shifts in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation and goals, consider meeting with a financial planner or advisor.

In summary, start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA while maintaining a balance between tax efficiency and diversification. Once those are maximized, utilize taxable accounts for further investment opportunities.
