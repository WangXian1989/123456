(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Here’s a simple strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, as these accounts offer tax advantages.
3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.
4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: Any additional funds can then be diverted to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Assessing your own risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals is essential in this process.

1. **First Things First: Get That Match**: Dive into your 401(k) and grab every last drop of that employer match. It’s like finding $20 on the ground; don't walk away from free cash!
   
2. **IRA Time**: If you can swing it, pump up contributions to your IRA next. Traditional IRAs can give you a tax break, and Roth IRAs let your money grow tax-free. It’s a win-win, so why not?

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After that, keep adding to your 401(k) until you hit the contribution cap. You’re basically filling your piggy bank with gold here.

4. **Taxable Accounts Are Your Safety Net**: Any leftover cash? Toss it into a taxable account. Just remember, this is where Uncle Sam gets to take a closer look at your gains, so keep an eye on tax-efficient investments.

Ultimately, you gotta check your goals and your risk appetite. Just think of it as building a financial buffet where you want a little bit of everything that's delicious! 🍽️💸
