I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options that are commonly considered for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function tests and regular check-ups can help manage the condition effectively.
4. **Management of Associated Conditions**: If you have conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol, managing these can help reduce liver strain.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions or procedures may be necessary, including liver transplants.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
