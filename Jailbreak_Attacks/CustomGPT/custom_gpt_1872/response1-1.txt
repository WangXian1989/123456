Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions:** Funds in a 401(k) or traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, which helps you save on taxes now. Consider these for high-income years.
   - **Tax-Free Withdrawals in Retirement:** Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals, which can be advantageous if you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

### 3. **Balance for Flexibility and Access**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - Diversify your portfolio by holding a mix of asset classes—stocks, bonds, and cash—across all accounts. This can help manage risk and take advantage of different tax treatments.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Continuously monitor your investments and asset allocation across accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary based on market changes and your evolving situation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Everyone's financial situation is unique. Speaking with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Summary
A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) (especially up to the match), fund your IRA, and then allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. This strategy allows you to take advantage of tax benefits while also maintaining flexibility to access your money when needed.

Always remember to keep an eye on your long-term goals and consult with a professional if you need personalized advice.
