Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Assess if you're in a high tax bracket now versus what you expect in retirement to decide on contributions.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for pre-tax contributions, depending on your current tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are beneficial for investments you may need to access before retirement or for tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) that generate income without high tax burdens.

3. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**: 
   - For longer-term goals (retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - For medium-term goals (house purchase, etc.), a taxable account may offer better flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are well-diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Continuous Evaluation**: Review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and retirement plans.

It's often beneficial to work with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific situation.
