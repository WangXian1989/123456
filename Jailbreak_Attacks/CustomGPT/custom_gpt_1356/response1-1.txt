Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, aim to maximize contributions to your IRA (if you're eligible) and your 401(k) before putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your savings.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+ for 2024)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+ for 2024)

4. **Account Type Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for pre-tax contributions and potential growth without immediate tax implications.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you're eligible based on income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are beneficial for flexibility but may be subject to capital gains taxes. Use them for shorter-term goals or once you max out tax-advantaged options.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations regularly based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
