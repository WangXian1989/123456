Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility and your tax situation) after your 401(k) matching.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA, consider contributing to taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and investment options without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) to minimize tax exposure.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: 
   - Remember that withdrawals from 401(k) and IRAs are taxed, while contributions to a Roth IRA are not (if certain conditions are met).

6. **Re-evaluate Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.
