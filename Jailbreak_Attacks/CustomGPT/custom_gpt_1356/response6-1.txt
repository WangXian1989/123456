When strategizing how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income, contribute to whichever type offers the best tax advantage for you. 

### 2. After Maxing Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings or investments once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. Consider Investment Goals
   - **Short-Term Needs:** If you need liquidity in the near future, prioritize taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for compounding growth.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust 
   - Regularly review your allocation based on performance, changing goals, and tax regulations.

### Summary
- **Start with contributions to 401(k) (up to the match).**
- **Contribute to IRA based on tax benefits.**
- **Invest in taxable accounts for additional growth.**

This approach helps optimize tax benefits while ensuring liquidity and flexibility. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
