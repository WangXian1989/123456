Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Prioritize contributions up to the match limit. This account offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or after contributing to tax-advantaged accounts. Interest and dividends in taxable accounts are subject to income tax.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to lower taxable income now.
   - If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risks according to your age, goals, and market conditions.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your distribution strategy annually, especially as your income, tax situation, and financial objectives change.

### Conclusion:
While this strategy works for many, it's important to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically to your unique needs and situation.
