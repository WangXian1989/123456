I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general suggestions for liver health. Common treatments and lifestyle changes include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs.

2. **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health. Some may benefit from reduced sugar and salt intake.

3. **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can improve liver function, especially in cases of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can help prevent further liver damage.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and health.

6. **Alternative Therapies**: Some may find benefits in herbal supplements like milk thistle; however, consult with your doctor before trying any new treatments.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
