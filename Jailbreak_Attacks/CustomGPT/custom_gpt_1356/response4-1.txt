Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually up to 6% of your salary).

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional).
   - **Tax Benefits**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) or Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions), based on your current tax bracket and expected future income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings, investing in assets that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place investments with higher potential growth (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and bond holdings in taxable accounts, due to their interest income being taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Evaluate Withdrawal Needs**:
   - Consider when you’ll need access to funds. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility, while retirement accounts often have penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocation periodically to adjust for market changes and life events.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Adjust these strategies based on your specific financial needs and goals.
