Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, either Traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments subject to capital gains tax. More flexible for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) Up to Match**: Contribute enough to get the company match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out contributions if you can, especially Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing your IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k) if you can.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 3. **Assess Investment Options**
   - Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds).

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Hold bonds or income-producing investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your portfolio annually to adjust your asset allocation to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Consult a Professional**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your situation.

By strategically spreading your investments across these accounts, you can optimize growth while effectively managing tax implications.
