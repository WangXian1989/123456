When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. 

A common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, such as your 401(k) and IRA, before allocating funds to taxable accounts. This is primarily because these accounts can offer tax benefits that may enhance your overall returns. For instance, contributions to a 401(k) often reduce your taxable income for the year, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, under certain conditions.

You should first consider maximizing any employer match available in your 401(k), as this is essentially "free money". Once you have taken full advantage of the match, it may be beneficial to direct further contributions to your IRA, especially if you qualify for tax deductions based on your income level. If you have maxed out contributions to the IRA, you can return to your 401(k) to continue investing, as 401(k) plans typically have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

After ensuring you are effectively utilizing these tax-advantaged options, you might look to allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts can provide more liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to access funds without the constraints that come with retirement accounts. However, keep in mind that investment income from these accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes and other taxes that might not apply to tax-advantaged accounts.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your unique financial situation, investment philosophy, and long-term goals. A financial advisor can provide tailored advice, helping you optimize your portfolio to align with your specific needs and objectives.
