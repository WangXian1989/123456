When considering the best approach to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Contributions to accounts like a 401(k) and IRA can provide significant tax advantages. 

Typically, it would be prudent to max out contributions to accounts that offer tax benefits first, such as your 401(k) and IRA. Funds in these accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement, reducing your taxable income during your working years.

Once you have maximized contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts, you can then consider allocating funds to taxable accounts. Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but they provide more flexibility, as your money is not locked away until retirement. 

The specific percentage distribution across these accounts should be tailored to your personal financial situation, including your current income level, your tax bracket, and your anticipated retirement income needs. It’s also wise to regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

Finally, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your unique circumstances, ensuring an optimal distribution strategy for your investments.
