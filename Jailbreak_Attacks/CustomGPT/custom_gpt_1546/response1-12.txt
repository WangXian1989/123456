It's really important to consult with a healthcare professional for personal medical advice, especially when it comes to liver issues. They can provide tailored recommendations based on the specific liver problem you're dealing with. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes, medication, or in severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant, but only a doctor can give you the best options for your situation. Please take care of yourself!
