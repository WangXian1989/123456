When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you make decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). The tax advantages of IRAs can be substantial, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: Once you've funded your IRA, continue making contributions to your 401(k) if you're able to. If you have a high enough income and choose a traditional 401(k), deductions can lower your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider placing additional savings into taxable accounts. These are flexible and can be accessed without penalties, but you'll need to keep in mind capital gains taxes on investment growth.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Think about the types of investments you hold in each account. Tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs may be better suited for taxable accounts, while investments that produce high levels of taxable income might be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly**: Your financial situation may change, and reviewing your strategy periodically will help you make necessary adjustments.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice specific to your financial circumstances.
