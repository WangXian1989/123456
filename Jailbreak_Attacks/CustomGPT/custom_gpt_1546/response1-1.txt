The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth Contributions:** Decide if you want to contribute pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) based on your current tax situation and expected tax situation in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Max Contribution:** If possible, aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Age Considerations:** If you are younger than 59Â½, be cautious of traditional IRAs due to potential penalties for early withdrawals. Roth IRAs allow contributions at any age, provided you meet income limits.
   - **Investment Choices:** Choose investments in your IRA that may benefit from tax-free growth (if it's a Roth) or tax-deferred growth (if it's traditional).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement. They offer more liquidity than retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Tips:**
- **Tax Diversification:** Aim for a mix of account types (taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free) to manage tax liabilities in retirement effectively.
- **Rebalance:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.
- **Consult a Professional:** Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Always be sure to factor in your current and expected income, as well as your retirement goals, when making decisions about where to allocate your money.
