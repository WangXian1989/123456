To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider tax implications: Traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If you are in a higher tax bracket now, this might be a beneficial option.
   - Evaluate investment options: Check the investment choices available in your 401(k) and ensure they align with your investment goals.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Choose between Traditional or Roth IRA: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA.
   - Max out contributions: Aim to fully fund your IRA each year, especially if you're eligible for a tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest for flexibility: Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or projects since they provide more flexibility than retirement accounts.
   - Diversify investments: Focus on long-term investments like stocks or ETFs that may yield favorable capital gains treatment.
   - Mind tax implications: Be strategic about selling investments to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding onto investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Determine your retirement goals: Understand how much you need for retirement to guide your contributions.
   - Balance risk and returns: Assess your risk tolerance and invest appropriately across all accounts.
   - Regularly review and rebalance: Periodically review your investment allocations to ensure they still align with your goals and adjust as needed.

It's crucial to consult with a financial advisor to personalize these strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
