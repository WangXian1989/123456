To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions if you qualify. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, consider using a Traditional IRA or 401(k) to reduce your taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Assets in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on investments that may generate higher taxes in a taxable account (e.g., stocks with high growth potential).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. **Debt Consideration**
   - If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before maximizing contributions.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before investing heavily.

### 6. **Regular Reassessments**
   - Review your distribution annually to make adjustments based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

### Example Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **IRA**: Max out the contribution (consider a Roth if eligible).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth.

### Conclusion
A well-rounded distribution strategy focuses on tax efficiency, matching contributions, and growth potential, tailored to your individual financial situation and goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice!
