As your Ecommerce Tax Consultant, hereâ€™s a strategic approach to distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (essentially free money). Maximize your contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. 

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may offer better liquidity or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement, as these accounts have fewer restrictions.

### 3. **Consider Asset Location:**
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) are better in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like stocks) can be held in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial goals or investment performance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of salary (up to employer match)
- **IRA:** Max out annual limit ($6,500 for those under 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any surplus funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

This balanced approach helps optimize your tax situation while providing flexibility for your financial goals. If you have specific income levels or goals, we can refine this further!
