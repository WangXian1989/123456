To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): For 2023, it's $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50).
   - IRA: $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).
   - Taxable accounts: No limits, but tax implications vary.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and IRA contributions reduce taxable income. Focus on tax-efficient investments here (e.g., bonds, REITs).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - **Younger Individuals**: Favor growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Consider how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

By balancing your contributions and considering tax implications, you can create a more efficient investment strategy.
