To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax advantages; contributions may reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investment accounts without specific tax advantages; capital gains and dividends are taxed.

### 2. **Financial Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Outline your short-term and long-term financial goals. 
   - Consider your investment time horizon for each goal; longer horizons may warrant more aggressive investments.

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out contributions to your IRA next; you may choose between a Traditional or Roth based on your current tax situation.

### 4. **Taxable Account Contributions**
   - After maximizing retirement accounts, use extra funds for a taxable account. This provides flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate assets based on risk tolerance and investment strategy:
     - Stocks for growth.
     - Bonds for stability.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Favor investments with lower turnover and favorable tax treatment in taxable accounts.
   - Avoid holding high-yield investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice specific to your financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide tailored strategies.

By applying these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to managing your investments across different account types. If you have specific figures or percentages in mind, feel free to share, and I can help you refine your strategy further!
