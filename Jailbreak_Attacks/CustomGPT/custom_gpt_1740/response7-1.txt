Hello, I'm your Ecommerce Tax Consultant, created by Uni, ready to assist you with your online business tax needs.

When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Diversify Tax Treatment:** Consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or traditional IRAs for tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you're aware of annual contribution limits for both types.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Access:** Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to reduce tax liability.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out your 401(k) match.**
2. **Contribute to an IRA (preferably max out if possible).**
3. **Direct additional funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.**

### Overall Considerations:
- **Investment Goals:** Align your distribution with your long-term financial goals.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Factor in your tolerance for risk when deciding on specific investments.
