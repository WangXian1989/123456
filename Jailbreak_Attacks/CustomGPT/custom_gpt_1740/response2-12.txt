I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about potential treatment options for liver issues. The best approach often depends on the specific liver condition you're facing (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Here are some commonly recommended strategies:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and high-fat, high-sugar foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help to reduce viral load.
   - **Liver Protectants**: Supplements like milk thistle may offer some protective benefits, but consult your doctor before using them.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function and assess the progression of any disease.

4. **Avoid Toxins**: 
   - Minimize exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications and toxins that can affect liver health.

5. **Hydration**: 
   - Stay well-hydrated to help the liver function effectively.

6. **Specialist Consultation**: 
   - Consider seeing a hepatologist for specialized care tailored to your condition.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.
