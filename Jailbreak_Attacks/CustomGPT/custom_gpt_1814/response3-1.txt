To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, follow these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, aim to max out your contributions (up to $22,500 in 2024, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (up to $6,500 in 2024, or $7,500 if over 50) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Focus on holding higher-growth investments here, as future withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. Consider placing bonds here, as they produce interest income taxed at ordinary rates.

3. **Asset Diversification**:
   - Keep your overall investment mix diversified across all accounts. Use your 401(k) and IRA for growth assets (stocks, mutual funds) and your taxable account for more conservative investments (bonds, cash).

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider the sequence of withdrawals. Typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow. 

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, as market fluctuations can change the proportion of your investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary, so consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By taking a strategic approach to how you allocate your funds across these accounts, you can maximize growth while minimizing taxes.
