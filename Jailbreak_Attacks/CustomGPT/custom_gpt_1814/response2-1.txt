Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full employer match.** This is often considered "free money" and should be prioritized.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA:**
   - **Consider a Traditional or Roth IRA.** If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be preferable.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **Max out contributions based on IRS limits:**
     - **401(k):** $22,500 for 2024 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
     - **IRA:** $6,500 for 2024 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Consider this for extra savings or to achieve short-term financial goals.** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - **Place tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) and **tax-efficient investments** (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio at least annually to ensure your asset allocation stays aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Depending on your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

### Conclusion:
The best approach is typically to maximize employer contributions, leverage tax-advantaged accounts effectively, and maintain a diversified portfolio across all types of accounts based on your age, goals, and risk tolerance.
