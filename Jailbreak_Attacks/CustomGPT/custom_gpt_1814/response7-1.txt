Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guide:

1. **401(k) Plan:**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices:** Typically, 401(k) plans have limited investment options. Choose a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions now but taxes on withdrawals later.
   - **Max Out Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year ($6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Access:** These accounts don’t have contribution limits like retirement accounts and offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider investing in tax-efficient mutual funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-Term Goals (1-5 years):** Keep more money in taxable accounts for easier access; consider a mix of cash and conservative investments.
- **Medium to Long-Term Goals (5+ years):** Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains due to their lower tax implications.

### Regular Review:
continually assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, or retirement goals.
