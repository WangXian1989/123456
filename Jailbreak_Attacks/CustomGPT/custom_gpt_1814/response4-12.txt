I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's crucial to discuss your specific condition with a healthcare professional. Common approaches to liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet, reducing fats and sugars while increasing fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Completely avoiding alcohol can prevent further damage.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the health of your liver.

4. **Interventional Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or even liver transplantation might be options.

5. **Herbal Supplements**: Some people explore herbal remedies, but it's vital to consult a healthcare provider first.

Always consult with a physician for diagnosis and personalized treatment options.
