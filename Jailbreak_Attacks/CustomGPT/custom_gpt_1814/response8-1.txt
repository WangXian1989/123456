Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. These accounts can provide liquidity, but be aware of capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust the risk level of your investments in each account. Generally, longer-term accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) can handle more aggressive investments than taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your allocation and rebalance if one account grows significantly compared to others.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how withdrawals from these accounts will be taxed in retirement, especially from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
