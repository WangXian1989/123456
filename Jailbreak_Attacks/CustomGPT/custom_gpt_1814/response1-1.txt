Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions if possible, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider funding a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, making them advantageous if you want to lower your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement. They offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Allocate to taxable accounts for liquidity or if you’ve maxed out contributions to retirement accounts.
   - Review your allocations periodically based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation is also a smart move!
