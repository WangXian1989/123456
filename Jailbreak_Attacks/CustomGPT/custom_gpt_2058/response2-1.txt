When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After maximizing your employer's match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Debt and Expenses Evaluation:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maximizing retirement contributions, as the interest can negate investment gains.

4. **Distribute According to Contribution Limits:** Keep in mind the contribution limits: $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50) for a 401(k) and $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for IRAs as of 2023. 

5. **Diversify Tax Strategies:** Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to give you flexibility in retirement.

6. **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals:** If you need liquidity or have short-term goals, allocate funds into taxable accounts. 

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

Ultimately, it's essential to align your strategy with your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for a tailored plan.
