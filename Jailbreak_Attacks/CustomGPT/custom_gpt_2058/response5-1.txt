(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Maximize employer contributions if available, as this is essentially free money. Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income, making it a useful tool for retirement savings.

2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. This allows for tax-free withdrawals. Traditional IRAs can also be beneficial for tax deductions in the current year.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for short-term goals or emergencies. Prioritize investments with lower tax implications, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

It's crucial to balance your allocations based on your immediate needs versus long-term retirement planning. Consulting with a financial advisor can help personalize your strategy.
