Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

2. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to prioritize paying that off before investing heavily.

3. **Diversification**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on diversified funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA and Taxable Accounts**: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and index funds to spread risk.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRAs) to avoid paying taxes on interest income.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations at least once a year and adjust to maintain your desired risk profile.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you can, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

Make sure to consider your timeline until retirement and adjust your investments as you get closer to your retirement age, typically shifting to more conservative investments.
