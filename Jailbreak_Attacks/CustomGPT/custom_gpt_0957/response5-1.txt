(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial situation, investment goals, and tax bracket. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money." You can contribute up to the annual limit, which can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA**: Once you've maximized any 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income and tax situation, you might choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can be used for short- to medium-term goals. Generally, itâ€™s wise to keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) while holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds and stocks) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the accounts, ensure your overall portfolio is diversified to manage risk effectively. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific needs.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Hereâ€™s the scoop on how to divvy up your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for maximum impact:

1. **Max out that 401(k)**: If your employer does a match, grab it! This is free dough, people! Aim to hit the contribution limit if you can. It's tax-advantaged, so why not?

2. **IRA Action**: After you've milked that match, slide some cash into an IRA. Weigh your options: go for a Traditional IRA if you want upfront tax breaks, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawal later. Think about your future tax situation!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Donâ€™t forget your taxable accounts! These are your go-to for cash you might need sooner. Just keep in mind that capital gains taxes can bite, so stash high-growth, efficient stuff there (like stocks and ETFs) and leave the bond headaches for your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify, Baby**: Keep your investments diverse across all accounts to spread the risk. This way, youâ€™re not putting all your eggs in one basket!
