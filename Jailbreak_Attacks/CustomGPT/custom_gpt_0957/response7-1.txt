Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to effectively allocate your funds:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA/401(k))**:
   - After the match, consider maxing out an IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you qualify. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out the contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, start investing in taxable accounts. This can include stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, or bonds, depending on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) are taxed as ordinary income. Plan for this impact when considering future withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts can be more tax-efficient for long-term investments, as long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Diversification and Risk**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure about your strategy, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

This approach helps you optimize your savings while making the most of tax advantages. Remember to revisit your strategy annually or when significant life changes occur.
