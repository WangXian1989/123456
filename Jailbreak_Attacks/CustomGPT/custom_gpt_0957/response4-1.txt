Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and current investment strategies. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the money until withdrawal. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before allocating large sums to retirement accounts. Generally, 3-6 months of expenses is recommended.

4. **Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically has limited investment options. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.
   - **IRA**: More flexible with investment choices, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for investments you'll access before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can allow for more aggressive growth strategies in retirement accounts. For taxable accounts, a conservative approach may minimize tax implications.

6. **Annual Contributions**: For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (if under age 50) and $6,500 for IRAs. Plan to contribute as much as you can up to these limits.

7. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In your taxable account, consider selling underperforming investments to offset capital gains taxes.

8. **Review Periodically**: Regularly assess your allocations to ensure they align with your overall financial goals and any changes in your life situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
