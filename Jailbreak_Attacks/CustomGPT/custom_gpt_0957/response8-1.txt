Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: Contributions to these accounts may be tax-deductible (traditional) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth). Assess your current tax bracket and future expectations. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional account may be more beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't offer tax advantages but provide flexibility. It's often best to hold investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) here.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited in investment options. Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and maybe target-date funds based on your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: More investment options available. Consider focusing on diversifying your portfolio according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or as a place for investments that may generate capital gains (like stocks).

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating a large portion into these accounts, ensure you have sufficient savings in an accessible emergency fund.

5. **Adjust Contributions as Needed**: Reevaluate your financial situation annually or as your circumstances change (like income or expenses).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that factors in your specific situation, working with a financial professional can be beneficial.

Ultimately, the best distribution is one that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
