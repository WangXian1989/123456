Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that free money first. This is often the best return on investment.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on placing growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in these accounts since you won't pay capital gains taxes until withdrawal (for traditional accounts) or not at all if it's a Roth account.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for investments that generate income (like bonds or dividend stocks) or those that you might sell in the near term, as you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits here.

3. **Retirement Timing**: Consider your retirement timeline. If you’re far from retirement, prioritize growth, while if you’re closer, you might want to be more conservative with your asset allocation.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Diversify not just across asset classes (stocks, bonds) but also geographically and by sector.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Professional**: It can be invaluable to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By balancing these elements, you can create a strategy that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing tax efficiency.
