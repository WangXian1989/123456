Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings may be subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding investments with high growth potential here.

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - If you have a long time until retirement, you might consider a more aggressive investment strategy in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you get closer to retirement, shifting towards more conservative investments can help protect your savings.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to each account to ensure consistent investing and harness the power of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Periodic Review**: Reassess your distribution strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize your savings for retirement and manage your tax obligations effectively.
