The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free. If you prefer tax deductions now, a traditional IRA could be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional savings.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) might be more advantageous. Conversely, if you expect higher taxes in retirement, consider Roth accounts.
   - **Capital Gains**: Investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Favor investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to mitigate this.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**
   - If you're close to retirement, favor more stable investments in your 401(k) and IRA to minimize risk. For longer time horizons, consider a more aggressive allocation in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) regardless of account type. This helps manage risk and optimize returns over time.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to align with your changing financial situation and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy (Hypothetical)
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (maximize employer match)
- **IRA**: $6,000 annual contribution (for tax-advantaged growth)
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining income after essentials and retirement contributions

It's often a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure you're meeting your financial goals effectively.
