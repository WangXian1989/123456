To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your income allows, try to contribute the maximum limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable ($6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - You can also consider tax-efficient funds and municipal bonds, which can provide tax-free interest.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, it's wise to hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Consider placing income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts because they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy** (for retirement):
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes. Usually, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial, as it allows tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, taking into account your income, retirement goals, and tax implications.
