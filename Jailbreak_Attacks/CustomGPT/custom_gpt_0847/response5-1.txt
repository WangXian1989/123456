(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored 401(k) accounts up to any matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." Next, consider funding an IRA for potential tax benefits, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA. After maximizing those contributions, you can allocate any additional funds to a taxable account, which offers more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. It's essential to review your overall financial plan and consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.
