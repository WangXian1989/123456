It's great that you're thinking about how to manage your investments! The best allocation of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify for deductible contributions to a traditional IRA or can contribute to a Roth IRA, consider maxing out your IRA contribution limits after your 401(k) matches are in.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. They offer more flexibility, though keep an eye on capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider keeping stocks in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances. You've got this! ðŸŒŸ
