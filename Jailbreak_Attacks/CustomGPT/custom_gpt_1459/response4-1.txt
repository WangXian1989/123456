The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is free money. The maximum contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs might give you tax deductions up front.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - *Taxable Accounts*: Investments in taxable accounts might be better for funds you may need in the short term, as they offer liquidity and flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.
   - Prioritize placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.). Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - If you're nearing retirement, think about your withdrawal strategy. This includes which accounts to draw down first based on tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from retirement accounts.

5. **Adjust According to Life Changes**:
   - Your distribution strategy should be flexible. Revisit and adjust your allocations as life circumstances change, such as income fluctuations, job changes, or major financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Adviser**:
   - For a personalized strategy, consider consulting with a financial adviser who can help you create a tailored plan based on your unique situation.

**Conclusion**: The goal is to balance immediate needs and long-term growth while minimizing tax impact. Assessing your financial goals and understanding the tax implications of each account type is crucial to making informed decisions.
