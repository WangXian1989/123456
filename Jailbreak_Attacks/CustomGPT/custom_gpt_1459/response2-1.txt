To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and potentially higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free in retirement), providing flexibility in tax treatment.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes, ideal for goals that are shorter-term than retirement.

2. **Utilize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially “free money” and a guaranteed return on your investment.

3. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Hold more volatile investments (like stocks) that benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Ideally, allocate more income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) to benefit from favorable capital gains treatment and tax-loss harvesting opportunities.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type. Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts up to the limits.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to balance risk and return.

6. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon should dictate how you allocate funds across these accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Think about your expected tax bracket in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, Roth contributions might be favorable.

It can also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.
