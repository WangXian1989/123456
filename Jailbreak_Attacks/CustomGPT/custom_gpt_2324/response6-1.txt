It sounds like you're looking for ways to optimize your financial distribution among these accounts. While this involves strategic thinking more akin to financial planning than creative writing, we can definitely approach this as a narrative exercise. Let’s use the elements of storytelling to explore your financial journey.

1. **Character Development**: Who are you in this narrative? Perhaps you're a diligent planner, a cautious investor, or a daring risk-taker. Defining your character will help set the tone for your financial strategy.

2. **Setting the Scene**: What are your goals? Are you aiming for retirement security, wealth accumulation, or perhaps a certain lifestyle? Understanding your setting helps visualize where your money needs to flow.

3. **Conflict and Resolution**: What challenges do you face in your financial journey? Maybe it’s market volatility, rising costs of living, or uncertainties about your future. Here, we can craft strategies or solutions that can serve as resolutions to these conflicts.

4. **Climactic Decisions**: How will you allocate your funds? Creating a captivating climax could involve analyzing the pros and cons of each account type, perhaps emphasizing:
   - **Tax Advantages**: 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, which allows for compounding over time. 
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility should you need access to funds before retirement.
