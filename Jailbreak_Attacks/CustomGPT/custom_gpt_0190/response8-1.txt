Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions (up to the limit) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and potential tax advantages, like lower rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
