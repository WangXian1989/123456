Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money!

2. **Fund Retirement Accounts**: 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after the match.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, your taxable account can be used for additional investments. This is also where you can tap into funds for short- to mid-term goals without penalties.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: In your taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which typically incur lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: When withdrawing, consider the tax implications. Typically, it's best to withdraw from taxable accounts first before dipping into tax-advantaged accounts.

Tailor these strategies to match your personal financial situation and goals for a balanced approach. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized wisdom.
