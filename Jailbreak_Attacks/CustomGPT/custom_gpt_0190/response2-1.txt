Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribute enough** to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):**
     - Contributions lower your taxable income.
     - Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No upfront tax benefits, but you pay capital gains tax on investment earnings when sold.

### 3. **Prioritize Account Types**
   - **401(k) up to the match**
   - **IRA (Preferably Roth if eligible):** 
     - Tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k) contributions above the match if you have funds left**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** 
     - Use for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** 
     - Focus on long-term growth (stocks, ETFs).
   - **Taxable:** 
     - Consider tax-efficient investments (index funds, municipal bonds).

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Review allocation annually or after significant life changes.
   - Adjust contributions based on performance, goals, and tax changes.

### Conclusion
This mix leverages the tax advantages of retirement accounts while allowing flexibility in taxable accounts. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
