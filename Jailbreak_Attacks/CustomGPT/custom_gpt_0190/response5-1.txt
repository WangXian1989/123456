To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as these accounts offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to minimize current taxes. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits. Use taxable accounts for income-generating investments (like bonds) to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals. Generally, it's recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement, then tax-deferred accounts, leaving tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) for last.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance, adjusting as needed across all accounts.
