Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest any remaining funds in a taxable account. This allows for more flexible access but may come with capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher bracket in retirement.
  
- **Investment Goals**: Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance and timeline. Younger investors might opt for more aggressive growth, while those nearing retirement should focus on preservation.

- **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough for the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to an IRA.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest excess funds based on personal goals.

### Revisit Regularly:
Review your allocations annually or when significant life events occur (like a job change, marriage, etc.) to ensure alignment with your financial objectives.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
