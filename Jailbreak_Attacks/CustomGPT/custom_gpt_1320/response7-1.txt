To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions here if you're eligible, especially if you can take advantage of Roth contributions for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on tax-deferred growth to minimize tax impacts while saving for retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of funds based on your risk tolerance; target-date funds can be a good choice for hands-off investing.
   - **IRA**: Similar approach as your 401(k), but you often have a wider range of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider low-turnover investments or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalance and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, typically starting with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
