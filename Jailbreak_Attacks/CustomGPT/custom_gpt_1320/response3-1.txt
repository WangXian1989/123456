Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually around 3-6% of your salary) as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - 401(k): Maximum of $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50) for 2024.
   - IRA: Contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2024.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: 401(k) reduces your taxable income now. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **After-Tax Roth Contributions**: Roth IRA grows tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 4. **Diversification and Liquidity**
   - Maintain some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity. These can be accessed without penalties and are great for short-term needs.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for longer-term, growth-oriented investments.
   - Keep more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts, and more stable income investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) for matching and then move to your IRA. Use taxable accounts for additional savings but ensure you're tax-efficient in your investment choices.
