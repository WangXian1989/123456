Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility.

### 2. **Goal-Based Allocation**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Emphasize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Max out employer matching in your 401(k) first.
   - Then, consider maximizing IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth.
   - Finally, use taxable accounts for any additional investments.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Consider target-date funds or diversified funds to match your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Use a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Annually review your investment balance and adjust based on performance and changes in your goals.

This balanced approach can help you manage your investments effectively while maximizing tax advantages.
