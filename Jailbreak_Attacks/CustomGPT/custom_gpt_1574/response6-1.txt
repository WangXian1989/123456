To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions. This reduces your taxable income and allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.
- **Use taxable accounts for after-tax investments**: Invest in assets that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, which are usually taxed at a lower rate.

### 2. Investment Allocation
- **401(k)**: Typically, this should hold your higher growth investments (like stocks) since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth; consider placing higher-growth investments here as well.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that yield capital gains, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

### 3. Contribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; then shift focus to IRAs.
- **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), fully fund your IRA, prioritizing Roth for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go here, especially if you're saving for short-term goals.

### Summary
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and lower tax-rate investments.
- Monitor and adjust based on tax laws and your personal financial goals.
