To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Utilize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is free money. If you can contribute more, do so, especially if tax-deferred growth benefits your long-term financial strategy.
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in retirement. 

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that have a lower tax burden, like long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.
   - Keep higher-yield, high-turnover investments (which generate more taxable events) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals, focus on tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - For short-term goals (less than five years), prioritize taxable accounts for flexibility and access.

4. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Adjust asset allocation based on each account's tax implications. For example, you might hold bonds in a tax-advantaged account and equities in taxable accounts for more favorable tax treatment on long-term gains.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Annually review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals. 

6. **Professional Guidance**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
