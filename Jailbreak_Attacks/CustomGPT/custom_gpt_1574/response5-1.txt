To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits (e.g., tax-deferred growth, potential deductions).
   - **Use Roth Accounts Wisely**: If you have a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA, consider contributing to these if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. This way, you can withdraw funds tax-free.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Equities in Taxable Accounts**: Since taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes, consider placing low-turnover investments (like index funds) in these accounts.
   - **Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Bonds can generate interest income subject to taxation, so it may be beneficial to hold them in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Matching**
   - **401(k) Matching Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of employer matching contributions before funding your IRA.

### 4. **Emergency Funds and Liquidity**
   - **Maintain Liquid Savings**: Ensure you have enough cash in your taxable account for emergencies and unexpected expenses, avoiding early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 5. **Future Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax Diversification**: A mix of pre-tax (401(k), traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) assets can give you flexibility in managing your tax liability in retirement.

### General Strategy
1. Prioritize maxing out employer match in your 401(k).
2. Max out contributions to your IRA (traditional/Roth).
3. Contribute additional funds to your 401(k).
4. Finally, invest in taxable accounts based on your investment goals and timeline.

### Regular Review
Assess your strategy regularly to adapt to changes in tax laws, your income, and investment needs.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
