Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're over 50, take advantage of catch-up contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer more flexibility and easier access to your funds without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Strategy and Diversification**
   - Diversify your investment choices in each account, considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and goals. Generally, it’s wise to hold more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (such as stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your financial objectives.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from your 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, capital gains in a taxable account may be taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates. Plan your withdrawals strategically during retirement to minimize taxes.

### **Example Distribution Strategy**:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income for enough to get the match.
- **IRA**: Maximize contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if 50+ for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
Tailor this general advice to your specific circumstances. It may also help to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy.
