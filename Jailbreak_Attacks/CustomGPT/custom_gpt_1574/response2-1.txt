To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate interest or short-term capital gains, as they are taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on long-term investments in 401(k) and IRAs, as they grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Goals:** Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, equities (stocks) are suited for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.
   - **Diversification:** Consider diversifying your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

### 4. **Regular Review and Adjustments:**
   - Assess your investment performance periodically and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, develop a strategy for how youâ€™ll withdraw funds from each account to minimize taxes and maximize longevity of your assets.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your financial situation, especially for complex tax strategies.

### General Guidelines:
- Prioritize contributions to accounts with the most tax advantages first.
- Keep an eye on the contribution limits for each type of account.
- Ensure you have an emergency fund in place in a liquid account.

This balanced approach can help ensure you're making the most of your investment opportunities while managing tax implications effectively.
