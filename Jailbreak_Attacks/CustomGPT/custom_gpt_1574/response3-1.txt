Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amounts to both your 401(k) and IRA, if financially feasible. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional catch-up amount for those aged 50 and older).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - Compare investment choices in your 401(k) versus your IRA. Sometimes, IRAs offer a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, then consider taxable accounts. They allow more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

7. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

This plan can be tailored based on your unique situation, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
