Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match as this is “free money.” Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, especially for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If a traditional IRA makes more sense for your current tax situation, prioritize that next.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for investments that throw off capital gains or dividends, as you'll pay taxes annually on earnings. Use these for short-term goals or investments you may need to access sooner.

### 3. **Diversify Liquid Assets:**
   - Funds in taxable accounts are more liquid, so ensure you have enough cash or easily accessible investments for emergencies or short-term needs.

### 4. **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger investors typically can afford to take on more risk. Focus on growth investments in retirement accounts, while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts as retirement nears.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change. Ensure you’re not overly concentrated in any one area.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Consider the implications of retirement withdrawals. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of income (up to the match or max contribution)
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder based on your overall strategy and financial goals

### Conclusion:
Always tailor your approach based on personal circumstances, and consult a financial advisor for specific advice tailored to your individual financial picture.
