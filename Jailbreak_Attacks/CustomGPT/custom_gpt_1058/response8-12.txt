1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, doctors may prescribe antiviral medications for viral hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms and complications.
3. **Supplements:** Some doctors may recommend vitamin E or other supplements if there's a specific deficiency.
4. **Avoiding Alcohol:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.
5. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and health.
6. **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases of liver damage or failure, a transplant may be necessary.

Always seek advice from a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan tailored to your needs.
