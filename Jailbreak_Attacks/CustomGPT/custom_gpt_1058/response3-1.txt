It’s essential to consider your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, this is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that allows for pre-tax contributions, meaning you contribute money before taxes are taken out. This can lower your taxable income.

   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: There are two main types—Traditional IRA (tax-deferred contributions) and Roth IRA (after-tax contributions). The choice impacts your tax situation at the time of withdrawal.

   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they occur.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you can qualify for tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - The longer your investment horizon, the more you may want to lean into stocks, especially in retirement accounts, to take advantage of compound growth.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Depending on your current tax bracket, it might be beneficial to have pre-tax contributions (401(k) and Traditional IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Roth accounts can be a good strategy if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket upon retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a diverse investment portfolio both within each account and across accounts to spread risk.

6. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Regularly review and adjust your contributions to ensure they align with your current strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities of tax implications and personal circumstances, consider consulting a financial planner to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
