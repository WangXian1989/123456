I'm not a medical professional, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. They will typically consider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopt a healthy diet low in fat and sugars.
   - Limit alcohol intake and avoid drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may recommend antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or other medications.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests such as ultrasounds or CT scans to assess liver health.

4. **Potential Procedures:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even a liver transplant might be considered.

It's essential to have personalized advice from a healthcare provider who understands your medical history and current condition.
