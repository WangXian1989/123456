The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by ensuring you are contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA, either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Distributing money effectively also involves understanding how taxes impact your accounts. For instance:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon sale, and any dividends or interest earned are taxed in the year they are received.

3. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Savings**: Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund. This provides a financial safety net and helps avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts prematurely.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Consider how you want to diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) and utilize your various accounts to achieve an optimal asset allocation. This can involve holding more aggressive investments in a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, while keeping more stable investments in your taxable accounts.

5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investment strategy with your financial goals. If you are years away from retirement, you might lean towards higher-risk investments, while those closer to retirement might prioritize stability and income.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment mix.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
