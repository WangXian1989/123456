Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Tax-Deferred Growth**: Since 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, prioritize this for retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Based on Income**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Try to max out your IRA contributions, especially if you're near retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or needs. These are less tax-advantaged but offer liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding index funds or municipal bonds here to minimize capital gains tax.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved.
2. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before allocating to taxable accounts.
3. **Allocate Based on Goals**: Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals while focusing on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
