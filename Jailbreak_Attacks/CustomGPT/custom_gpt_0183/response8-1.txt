To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Since contributions are pre-tax, prioritize this for retirement savings, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for shorter-term goals or when you expect to need access to funds before retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Equities**: Place higher-risk investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes. 
   - **Bonds**: Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact from interest income.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Avoid withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts until necessary. Use taxable accounts for early withdrawals to minimize penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or similar.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
