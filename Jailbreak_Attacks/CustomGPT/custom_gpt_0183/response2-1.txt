Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA next. The tax benefits can be significant, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in capital gains-friendly assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - For long-term growth (younger investors), consider a higher allocation to equities across all accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering the overall asset mix (stocks, bonds, etc.).

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw from each account in retirement to manage tax implications effectively.

### Recommended Distribution:
- **20-30% in 401(k)**
- **20-30% in IRA**
- **40-60% in Taxable Accounts**

Adjust these percentages based on your specific situation, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
