To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.

2. **Asset Allocation**: Use tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate fewer taxable events. Place higher-growth assets in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.

3. **Retirement Accounts First**: Prioritize funding retirement accounts first due to tax advantages, then allocate additional funds to taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals strategically in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Income Considerations**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, consider utilizing tax-deferred accounts more heavily, as they can save you money in taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to managing your retirement funds and taxable investments.
