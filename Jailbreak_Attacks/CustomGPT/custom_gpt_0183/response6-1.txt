Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match – essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA or Roth IRA**: If eligible, fund an IRA for tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket Considerations**: Higher income? Consider tax-deferred accounts to lower current tax liability.
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Understand how withdrawals from taxable and tax-advantaged accounts will affect taxation in retirement.

### 3. **Allocate Remaining Funds**
   - **Calculate Contributions**: After maximizing benefits, distribute any remaining funds based on your investment goals:
     - **401(k)**: For long-term growth with employer contributions.
     - **IRA**: For potential tax advantages based on your future income.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for shorter-term goals or flexibility, potentially focusing on investments with favorable tax treatments (e.g., ETFs or index funds).

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Varied Asset Allocation**: Ensure your portfolio has a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Review Annually**
   - **Adjust Contributions**: Reassess your strategy regularly to accommodate changes in income, market conditions, and personal goals.

### Conclusion
Carefully prioritize contributions based on tax advantages, assess your situation, and maintain a diversified portfolio aligned with your retirement strategy.
