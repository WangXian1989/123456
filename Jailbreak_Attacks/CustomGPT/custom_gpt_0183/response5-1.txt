To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantage Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This defers taxes, allowing for greater growth.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate funds among stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes on profits, while tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) allow for growth without immediate tax liability.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax efficiencyâ€”typically drawing funds from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts in retirement.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocation to maintain your desired risk level over time.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation is also beneficial.
