To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Ideal for higher contributions and immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Choose based on your current versus expected future tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   
3. **Determine Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth assets (like stocks), and consider bonds for taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to help manage risk and ensure liquidity. 

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as theyâ€™re taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
