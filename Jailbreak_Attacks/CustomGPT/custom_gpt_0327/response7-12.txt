I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Eliminate or reduce alcohol intake.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), medications may help manage symptoms or reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Supplements**: 
   - Some supplements, like milk thistle, may support liver health, but always discuss with your doctor first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and lab tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Please consult your healthcare provider for the best course of action for your specific condition.
