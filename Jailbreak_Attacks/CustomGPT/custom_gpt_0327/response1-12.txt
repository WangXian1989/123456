I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's important to consult a healthcare professional. They might recommend:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet adjustments, exercise, and avoiding alcohol can be crucial.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or slow progression.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging can help track liver health.
4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In some cases, procedures to remove blockages or even a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider for your specific situation.
