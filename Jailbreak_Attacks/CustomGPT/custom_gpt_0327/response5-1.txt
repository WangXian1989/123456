Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), which can help you save on taxes now or in retirement.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose the Right Type**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of income limits, especially for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for investments that you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in assets that are more tax-efficient (like index funds, ETFs) and consider capital gains tax implications.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize 401(k) up to the match**: First, fund your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- **Then fund IRA**: Max out an IRA if eligible, especially Roth if you expect higher taxes in the future.
- **Finally, invest in taxable accounts**: Use any remaining funds for taxable investments, focusing on those that have favorable tax treatment.

### Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might focus more on growth strategies, while those closer to retirement might prefer stability.
- **Tax Planning**: Consult with a tax advisor to create a strategy that minimizes your overall tax burden.

This approach helps leverage the benefits of each account type while aligning with your personal financial goals.
