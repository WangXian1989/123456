Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out IRA contributions**: If you qualify, maximize your contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for extra savings or investments once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. These can be useful for short-term goals or for flexibility.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that withdrawals from 401(k) and IRAs can be taxed, while gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at capital gains rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Consulting with a financial advisor might provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
