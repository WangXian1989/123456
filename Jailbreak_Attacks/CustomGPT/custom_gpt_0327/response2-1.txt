When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money and should be a priority.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Tax Diversification**
   - Use a mix of traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (post-tax) accounts to benefit from different tax rates in retirement. This strategy provides flexibility in managing taxable income in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Investment Options**
   - **401(k)** accounts may have limited investment choices. If your 401(k) fees are high or every offer is poor, prioritize your IRA or taxable accounts for broader investment options.
   - Invest in low-cost index funds or ETFs for long-term growth.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement. Consider funds that generate qualified dividends to benefit from lower tax rates.

### 5. **Annual Contributions**
   - Regularly review your contributions to ensure you are maximizing limits each year: 401(k) limits, IRA limits, and consider utilizing Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) if eligible.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation and retirement goals.

### Summary
Start with your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits and then allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility. Regular monitoring and adjustments will help optimize your retirement savings.
