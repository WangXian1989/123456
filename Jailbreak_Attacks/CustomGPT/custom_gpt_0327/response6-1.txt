To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits.
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: Determine if a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **401(k) Contributions**: Max out employer matching contributions to leverage free money.
- **IRA Limits**: Consider fully funding your IRA if eligible, focusing on either Traditional or Roth based on your income.

### 3. Investment Diversification
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across various asset types (stocks, bonds) tailored to your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement.

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy
- **Retirement Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals from each account type strategically to minimize taxes and prolong your funds.

Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation and tax laws.
