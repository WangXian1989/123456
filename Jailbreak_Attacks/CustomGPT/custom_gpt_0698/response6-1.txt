Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out this account before moving to others.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for tax deductions, maximize contributions here after your 401(k) to benefit from additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for funds that you may need access to before retirement or for short-term goals. Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Retirement Timeline**
   - If retirement is near, focus on preserving capital, and shift a portion to safer investments like bonds within your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For longer timelines, you can afford to have a more aggressive allocation in both your 401(k) and IRA.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across accounts, aligning investments with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
   - Consider rebalancing your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** and ensure you are maximizing employer contributions.
- **Consider your tax situation** and tailor your investments based on potential tax impacts.
- **Align your strategy with your retirement timeline** and adjust your risk accordingly.

This structured approach can help you optimize your investments across various account types. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
