To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: If you have a Roth IRA available, consider contributing to it after your 401(k) match. Roth accounts provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Reduce Taxable Income**: Contribute to a traditional IRA or a traditional 401(k) to lower your taxable income, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Maintain a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts. This allows you flexibility in retirement withdrawals to manage tax implications effectively.

5. **Invest for Growth**: In your taxable account, focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and the time until you need to access those funds. Generally, a more aggressive allocation could be suitable for long-term retirement accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure about the best allocation based on your personal situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth potential while considering tax implications and your individual financial goals.
