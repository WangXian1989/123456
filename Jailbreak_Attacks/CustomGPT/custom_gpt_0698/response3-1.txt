Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Always contribute at least enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and consider maximizing your contributions if you can afford it.
- **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your plan and choose a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**: 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits, but withdrawals are taxed as income in retirement.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Flexibility**: If you are eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for long-term tax advantages, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: Keep an eye on annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquidity**: These accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalty. Consider using them for short- to medium-term savings goals.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investing in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Be mindful of tax implications on dividends and interest earned.
- **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts to diversify your investments further, balancing risk across different account types.

### General Distribution Strategy
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a robust emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before aggressively investing.
2. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the match, then consider maxing out an IRA, and finally allocate excess funds to your taxable account.
3. **Assess Tax Impact**: Regularly assess your investment strategyâ€™s tax impact and adjust your contributions accordingly. If you expect a lower tax rate in retirement, traditional accounts may be beneficial.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution varies based on individual circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.
