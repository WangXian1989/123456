Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the matched amount and consider contributing up to the IRS limit if you can afford it. This offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, if eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for extra savings or investments once you’ve adequately funded your tax-advantaged accounts. This can include investments in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds that don’t provide immediate tax benefits.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), traditional IRA)**: Consider holding assets with high growth potential (like stocks) that you don't want to sell frequently due to their higher tax implications when sold.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate, and consider tax-efficient funds.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider working with a financial professional.

This strategy aims to maximize tax efficiency while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
