Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Roth IRAs can be especially beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as they'll be taxed at lower rates.
   - Consider municipal bonds, which are often tax-exempt.

4. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA) may be more beneficial since you’ll be taxed on withdrawal rates, hopefully at lower rates in retirement.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in a taxable account to cover emergencies. Aim for three to six months’ worth of expenses.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your distribution and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider which accounts to draw from to minimize taxes and optimize your retirement income.

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation.
