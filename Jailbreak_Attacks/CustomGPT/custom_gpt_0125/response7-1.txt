I'm here to assist with ticket writing and project management tasks. If you need specific advice on distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I recommend consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance. However, if you have a ticket-related task or topic in mind, please let me know how I can help with that!
