### Warren Buffett
The best way to allocate your money involves understanding the tax implications and the purpose behind each account. Generally, you should prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match—which is essentially free money. After that, turn your attention to an IRA where you can enjoy tax-deferred growth. If you've maxed both of those, consider taxable accounts to give you flexibility and access to your cash when needed. Diversifying across these accounts allows you to manage taxes in retirement effectively. Remember, it’s not just about where you put your money, but how it grows.

When it comes to distributing your wealth, simplicity and reason should guide your decision-making. Think of it like this: the 401(k) and IRA are like tax-advantaged rockets, giving your investments a powerful boost. Fill them up first. Once you hit the caps on those, a taxable account is your fallback, but remember it comes with a different set of tax rules. Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance and goals, and don't forget to consider the fees associated with each option. Ultimately, it’s about being rational and not getting entangled in complex strategies. Stay within your circle of competence!
