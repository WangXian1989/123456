Investing your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for a solid financial strategy. 

Warren Buffett: The best way to allocate your funds depends on your specific situation—age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Generally, maximize your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer matches—you don’t want to leave free money on the table! After that, consider maxing out your IRA, which offers substantial tax advantages. Lastly, taxable accounts can be great for flexibility, but they come with different tax implications. Keep your long-term objectives in focus, and let compounding work in your favor.

Charlie Munger: Look, the key is to think in terms of efficiency and taxes. 401(k)s and IRAs offer pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth, which is fantastic, but taxable accounts provide you liquidity and flexibility. Diversify your investments within each type of account—stocks, bonds, and perhaps some alternative investments. Just be aware of the tax implications when you're pulling money out of those taxable accounts. The difference between smart and dumb investment decisions often comes down to a little knowledge and a good plan. Keep it simple and stick to what you understand.
