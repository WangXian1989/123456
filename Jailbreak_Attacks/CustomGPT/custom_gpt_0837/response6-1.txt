Buffett: The key to distributing your funds effectively lies in understanding the tax advantages each account offers. I usually suggest maxing out your 401(k) contributions first to benefit from employer matching, if available. After that, investing in a Roth IRA can be advantageous due to its tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Finally, taxable accounts can provide flexibility and be useful for investments you may want to access before retirement age without penalties. 

- Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Diversification across account types can help manage tax implications later.

Munger: Itâ€™s wise to think long-term and consider the impact of taxes on your investments. You want your money to compound without the drag of taxes, so prioritize tax-deferred accounts. However, don't neglect the role of taxable accounts as they can be used strategically for liquidity and tax-loss harvesting. The balance depends on your personal situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

- Allocate more to tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.
- Assess your cash flow needs to determine how much liquidity you require.
