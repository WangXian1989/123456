Buffett: It largely depends on your individual situation, investment goals, and time horizon. In general, I prefer to contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA first, as they can provide tax benefits, especially if your employer matches contributions. Make sure you're getting the full match in your 401(k) if that's available to you—it's effectively free money. After maximizing those tax-advantaged accounts, you can then consider taxable accounts for additional investments.

Munger: Don't overlook the power of compound interest when deciding where to allocate your investments. The earlier you put your money to work in tax-advantaged accounts, the more it can grow without the drag of taxes. However, it's also important to maintain liquidity. Taxable accounts can provide more flexible access to your funds if needed. Balance is key—understand your tax situation, your liquidity needs, and the specific investments you’re comfortable holding in each type of account. Diversification across these accounts is essential for managing risk effectively.
