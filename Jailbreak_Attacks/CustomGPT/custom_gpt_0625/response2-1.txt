When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to weigh several factors, including your current and future tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing enough to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it due to its tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you’re in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - If you can’t contribute to a Roth IRA or prefer the tax deduction, a traditional IRA is a solid choice.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that may yield higher capital gains, as long-term capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Keep investments with higher turnover or frequent trading in tax-advantaged accounts (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes in all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and reward.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw from these accounts to minimize taxes, considering your required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations to maintain your desired level of risk.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and financial planning, consulting with a financial advisor can help create a strategy tailored to your specific situation.

Always remember to consider your own financial situation and goals when making these decisions.
