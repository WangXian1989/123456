To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, you may be eligible for tax-deductible contributions or Roth IRA conversions, which can provide tax-free growth.

### 2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate different types of investments based on the account type. 
     - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (ETFs) or income-generating assets (bonds, dividend stocks) due to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawals and Time Horizon:**
   - Ensure you have a withdrawal strategy that considers the timing of when you'll need to access the funds. 
   - **Short-term needs** should be kept in liquid assets within your taxable account, while **long-term goals** can be set in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Tax Implications:**
   - Withdrawals from a **401(k)** or **traditional IRA** are taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from a **Roth IRA** can be tax-free. 
   - Understand the impact of capital gains on your taxable investments and the preferential rates for long-term holdings.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income to maximize employer match.
- **IRA**: $6,000 annually (or $7,000 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining savings after maxing out the above accounts for flexibility and investment growth.

By balancing contributions wisely across these account types, you'll take advantage of tax benefits while maintaining liquidity and growth potential aligned with your financial goals.
