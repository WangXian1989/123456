Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your investment goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you have additional funds after maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). IRAs often have more investment options than a typical 401(k) and can offer tax advantages depending on which type you choose.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions:** If you can still contribute more after funding your IRA, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions. The contribution limits are higher for 401(k) accounts, which can be beneficial for growth.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. This is especially useful if you may need access to your money before retirement age, as these accounts do not have withdrawal penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation and Diversification:** Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance. Generally, growth-oriented assets like stocks might be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or lower-growth assets can be held in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

6. **Tax Considerations:** Keep in mind your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding where to place your investments. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, while tax-advantaged accounts offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** Periodically review your allocations and overall financial goals, making adjustments as necessary to ensure you remain aligned with your objectives.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your individual circumstances.
