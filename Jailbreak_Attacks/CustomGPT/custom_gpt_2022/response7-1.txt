To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) or IRA up to the maximum limits after securing the employer match. 
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in 401(k)s and traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement.
   - With Roth accounts, taxes are paid upfront, allowing for tax-free growth.
   - Taxable accounts may have capital gains taxes when you sell investments, so consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Account for Your Investment Horizon**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments, as they benefit most from compounding without immediate tax implications.
   - More liquid assets can be kept in taxable accounts for shorter-term needs since you can access them without penalties.

5. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, others) in all accounts, but be aware of your overall portfolio's risk. 

6. **Rebalance Accordingly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations across accounts based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
