Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. It grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Choose based on your expected tax bracket in retirement.
  
3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund and consider paying down high-interest debt before investing heavily.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you’re investing for retirement (long-term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - If you have shorter-term goals (like buying a house), use taxable accounts where you can access your money without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax impacts, withdrawing from taxable accounts first if you have a mix of account types.

7. **Regular Review**: Revisit your asset allocation and contributions regularly, adjusting based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
