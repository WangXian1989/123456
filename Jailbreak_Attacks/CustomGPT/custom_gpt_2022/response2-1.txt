The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get that full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments can be taxed on capital gains and dividends, so they are usually best for holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: 
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where they can compound without immediate tax implications.
   - Hold safer, income-generating assets in your taxable account, as qualified dividends and long-term gains may be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re investing for retirement (20+ years away), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you need access to funds sooner (for a home purchase, for example), a taxable account may be more suitable.

5. **Balance Contributions**: Ensure you’re balancing contributions based on limits:
   - For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - The IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older) across all IRAs.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation may change, so it’s important to review your allocations periodically and adjust based on your goals, market conditions, and any changes to tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation.
