To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, but Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your future expectations for taxes, choose the type that aligns with your strategy.
   
3. **Emergency Savings**: Maintain an adequate emergency fund in a taxable account or savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before prioritizing retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term savings goals or investments that may incur higher taxes, such as stocks with high turnover. This can provide liquidity when needed without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investment portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, keep more stable investments in taxable accounts (to minimize tax implications) and higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement. Retirees could generally withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial situations vary widely, so consider consulting a professional for tailored advice.
