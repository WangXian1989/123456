Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; it’s free money. 
   - **IRA**: Depending on income, consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can reduce taxable income now.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates. Assets that have high turnover or generate ordinary income (like bonds) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diverse Investment Types**:
   - Keep a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in your accounts. 
   - Generally, equities are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their growth potential and favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If your retirement is far off, focus on growth (more equities). If it’s closer, consider shifting to more conservative assets (bonds, cash).

5. **Review and Adjust Annually**:
   - Revisit your distribution strategy each year based on performance, changing financial goals, and tax law changes.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.

**Certainty**: 85% – This is a general approach; individual situations may vary significantly.
