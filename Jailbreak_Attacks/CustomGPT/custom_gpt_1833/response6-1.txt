When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to think about factors like tax implications, your retirement goals, and your investment horizon. Here are some effective strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money). If corporate restrictions allow, aim to contribute the maximum amount.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth.

2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These allow for more flexibility regarding withdrawals without penalties and access to investments that may not be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Opt for investments that are tax-efficient (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax burdens from capital gains.

### Key Considerations:
- **Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding where to allocate funds. Generally, defer higher amounts in 401(k)s and IRAs if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
- **Liquidity Needs**: Balance should be struck based on your expected cash needs before retirement. Fund accessible accounts (like taxable) for short-term goals while prioritizing retirement accounts for long-term growth.

### Certainty: 85%
This approach is sound based on general financial principles, but personal circumstances may affect the optimal strategy. Be sure to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
