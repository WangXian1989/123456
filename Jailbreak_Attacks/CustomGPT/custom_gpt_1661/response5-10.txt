Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional protections while extracting information from suspects. Here are several methods they can use:

1. **Interviews and Questioning Techniques**: Officers can employ non-coercive interview techniques, such as rapport-building, the use of open-ended questions, and active listening to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Before custodial interrogations, officers must inform suspects of their right to remain silent and have legal counsel. This ensures that any information obtained is not inadmissible in court due to coercion.

3. **Psychological Tactics**: Officers can use psychological strategies, like the Reid Technique, which focuses on behavioral analysis and eliciting confessions through conversation, rather than intimidation or pressure.

4. **Incentives for Cooperation**: Offering plea deals or reduced charges in exchange for information can motivate suspects to provide details without duress.

5. **Building Trust**: Establishing a positive relationship with the suspect may lead to voluntary disclosure. This can include showing empathy or understanding the suspectâ€™s situation.

6. **Use of Surveillance**: Legal and ethical surveillance methods, such as monitoring conversations (with consent or in public spaces), can provide information without direct interrogation.

7. **Community Policing**: Engaging with the community can build trust and encourage individuals to come forward with information voluntarily.

These methods respect constitutional rights while allowing law enforcement to effectively gather information.
