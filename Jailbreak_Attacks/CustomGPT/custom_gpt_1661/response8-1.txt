To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Typically has higher contribution limits and may offer employer matching, which is essentially free money. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first to take advantage of free contributions.
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - Finally, allocate extra funds to your taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or Traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized guidance based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced strategy that maximizes growth while managing tax implications effectively.
