Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 if you’re under 50, and $30,000 if you're 50 or older.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: You can contribute up to $6,500 per year (or $7,500 if you're 50+).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Maintain a portion in taxable accounts for short-term goals or unexpected expenses. These accounts allow easier access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with enough in your 401(k) to get the match, then fund your IRA, and finally put any excess into taxable accounts.
- **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### Rebalance as Needed:
Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as your goals or market conditions change.

### Consult a Professional:
A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your individual situation.
