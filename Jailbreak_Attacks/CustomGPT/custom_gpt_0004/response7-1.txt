Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your current taxable income but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) with potential tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Focus on Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for savings goals that may arise before retirement (e.g., buying a home).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Optimize investments based on account type:
   - Place high-growth, taxable investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains (like bonds).

5. **Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance**: Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess and rebalance as needed based on market performance and personal changes.
