Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA contributions next, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate higher short-term capital gains or interest income. It’s also good for holding investments you might need to access before retirement.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - Allocate more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts since taxes might be lower upon withdrawal. Invest more conservatively in taxable accounts if you may need this money soon.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Assess your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Diversify Across Accounts:**
   - Spread out your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) among all accounts to maintain diversity.

Ultimately, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
