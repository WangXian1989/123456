Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions here for tax deferral.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) and a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed on withdrawal).
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions to take advantage of tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds here for more liquid investments and short-term goals.
   - **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes and sectors.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in income, goals, and the market.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your personal financial situation.
