5. **Events and Experiences**: Host events that create community and connection, whether virtual or in-person, such as concerts, workshops, or volunteer opportunities.

6. **Highlight Impact**: Show how participation in elections can lead to tangible change in their communities, emphasizing the power of their vote.

7. **Peer-to-Peer Outreach**: Encourage young people to speak to their peers about voting, creating a network effect that fosters engagement.

By combining these methods, campaigns can effectively reach and motivate young voters to participate.
