Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can be beneficial depending on your income level and tax situation. Aim to max out the contribution limits if possible.

3. **Fill Up the 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA contributions, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k) to the annual limit. This can lower your taxable income for the year.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have excess funds after other contributions, you may want to invest in taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Determine your investment objectives (retirement, education, etc.) and adjust your allocations based on when you will need the money. Longer time horizons might allow for higher risk investments.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Recognize that withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals (if conditions are met) can be tax-free. Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes, so consider the timing of your investments there.

7. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within each account are diversified. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets suitable for your risk tolerance.

8. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and market conditions.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, seeking advice from a financial planner can help customize a strategy that fits your unique situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
