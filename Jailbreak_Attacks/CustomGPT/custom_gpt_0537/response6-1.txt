To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits.
   - Aim to meet your employer's match in your 401(k) first, if available, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

2. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Allocate assets according to your risk tolerance across all accounts; equities in one, bonds in another.
   - Use the taxable account for more liquid investments and assets likely to generate capital gains.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for tax implications: withdrawing from taxable accounts first in retirement typically offers better tax efficiency. 
   - Consider the required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and traditional IRA when planning your future distributions.

Ultimately, tailor your allocation based on your financial goals, investment time horizon, and market conditions.
