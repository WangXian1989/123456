The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions to the limit if you can afford it, especially if you have a high-income potential.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth. If you are eligible for a traditional IRA, it can offer tax deductions on contributions. Diversifying your tax exposure would be beneficial, so consider contributing to both types if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, or if you need flexibility, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account. This can be useful for short-term financial goals and offers more liquidity.

### General Strategy
- **Short-term needs**: Consider holding cash or low-risk investments in taxable accounts.
- **Medium to long-term needs**: Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for most of your investments.
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other asset classes according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Tax Considerations
- Minimize taxes by holding investments with high turnover or income-producing assets in tax-advantaged accounts.
- Consider capital gains tax implications in your taxable account when buying or selling investments.

Overall, consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your individual situation.
