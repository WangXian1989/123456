Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is key to effective retirement planning. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. It's tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. Balance Your Contributions
- If you have maxed out your 401(k) or IRA, use taxable accounts for additional savings. 
- **Diversify Investments**: In taxable accounts, focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds.

### 3. Understand Withdrawal Rules
- **401(k) and IRA**: Withdrawals before age 59Â½ may incur penalties.
- **Taxable Accounts**: You have more flexibility without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. Review Regularly
- Adjust contributions based on changes in income, goals, or tax laws.

### Conclusion
A mix of tax-advantaged and taxable accounts provides flexibility and tax efficiency. Regularly review your strategy to ensure it aligns with your goals.
