Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roths grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs give you upfront tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributions to traditional accounts lower your taxable income now, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, avoiding concentration in any one investment.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations annually to adjust for changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 20-30% (or max to employer match)
- **IRA:** 10-20% (depending on limits)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 50-70%

### Conclusion:
Tailor this allocation based on your specific needs, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
