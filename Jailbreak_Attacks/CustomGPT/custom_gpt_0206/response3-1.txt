Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - For short-term goals (e.g., buying a house), consider taxable accounts for easier access.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. 
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds, to minimize tax impact on returns.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary greatly, so consider consulting a professional for tailored advice.

This structured approach helps you balance growth, risk, and tax efficiency.
