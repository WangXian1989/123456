I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid processed foods and limit alcohol intake.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications may help reduce viral load.
   - **Corticosteroids**: Used for autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation.
