To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA). If you're in a lower bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - **Future Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, lean more towards Roth accounts.

### 3. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings to taxable accounts. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

### Additional Tips:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider speaking with a professional for personalized advice based on your unique situation.

This balanced approach can help optimize your tax efficiency and investment growth over time.
