The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. However, distributions during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions can be tax-deductible, which also helps lower your taxable income. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Interest and dividends are also taxed in the year they are received.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Aim for 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a liquid account.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before making significant contributions to retirement accounts.

6. **Retirement Goals**: Align your contributions with your retirement goals. If you plan to retire early, consider focusing more on taxable accounts for greater flexibility.

7. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of IRS contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to maximize your tax-advantaged savings.

8. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically reassess your investment strategy as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

9. **Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
