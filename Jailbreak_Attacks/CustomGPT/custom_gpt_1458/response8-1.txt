The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. IRAs often offer a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions**: If you are still under the IRS contribution limits and have additional funds, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Contributions to traditional 401(k)s can lower your taxable income.

4. **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can contribute to taxable accounts. In these accounts, consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments in all accounts are well diversified based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Think about how your contributions will affect your tax bracket now and in retirement. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while traditional accounts may be more advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your asset allocation and financial situation to ensure that your distribution strategy still aligns with your goals. Adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
