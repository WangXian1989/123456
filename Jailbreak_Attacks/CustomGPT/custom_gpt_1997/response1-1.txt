Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**
If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great place to start.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**
- **401(k):** After securing the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you can. This offers tax-deferred growth and typically has high contribution limits.
- **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you tax deductions now.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
- **Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts, then consider investing in taxable accounts. Here, you can take advantage of capital gains rates and potentially tax-loss harvesting.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, stocks are better suited for long-term growth in retirement accounts, while bonds can be appropriate for taxable accounts due to their interest income being taxed at ordinary rates.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
Monitor and adjust your investments based on market performance and changes in your goals or circumstances. 

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Consider talking to a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs and to navigate complexities like tax implications and investment choices.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax burdens.
