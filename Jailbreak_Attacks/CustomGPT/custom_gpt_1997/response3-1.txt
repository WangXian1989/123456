Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a match on contributions, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to secure the full match. This is essentially free money that boosts your retirement savings.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. 
   - A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth but may have tax implications upon withdrawal. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or high interest (like bonds), as these can be taxed at higher rates than long-term capital gains in retirement accounts.
   - In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, which can minimize your tax burden.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in each account, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor the performance and tax implications of your investments. As you approach retirement, you may want to shift assets to reduce risk and ensure liquidity.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - An advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific situation, goals, and changes in tax laws.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute at least to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50, as of 2023) based on eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds as necessary, focusing on filling gaps and investing tax-efficiently.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first, while considering your overall financial goals, usually leads to optimal outcomes. Adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.
