Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, goals, tax bracket, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money and a great way to kickstart your retirement savings.

### 2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - **Type of IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is best for you. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Max out your contributions if possible.

### 3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**
   - **Beyond the Match**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, which is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older for 2023).

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: If you can afford to save beyond the tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals, although they will be subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **Investment Choices**: Use this account for investments you may want to access before retirement or for short-term savings goals.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts may have different tax implications, so consider holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) and more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your portfolio and distribution strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Personalized Guidance**: For tailored advice considering your unique situation, consulting a financial advisor can be invaluable.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your retirement savings while optimizing tax efficiencies.
