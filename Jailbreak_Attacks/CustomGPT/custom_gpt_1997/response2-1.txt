Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**401(k) Contributions:**
- Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- Consider contributing the maximum limit if you’re in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

**IRA Contributions:**
- If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- Decide based on your current and projected future tax rates.

### 2. Build a Diversified Portfolio

**401(k) Investments:**
- Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance and age.
- Choose low-fee funds to maximize returns over time.

**IRA Investments:**
- Similar to your 401(k), diversify your investments here. You may have more options in an IRA than a 401(k).

### 3. Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility

- If you have maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for additional investments.
- Taxable accounts provide liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals, which can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust

- Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed.
- As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments to protect your capital.

### 5. Consider Professional Advice

- Depending on your financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your needs.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and maintaining a diversified investment strategy, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and minimize taxes.
