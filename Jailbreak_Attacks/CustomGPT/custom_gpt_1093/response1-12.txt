I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information on treatment options for liver problems. The best approach often depends on the specific condition affecting your liver. Here are some common treatments:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in fats and high in fruits and vegetables can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol is crucial for many liver conditions.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms or combat infections.

3. **Monitoring and Lifestyle Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver health and track progression.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In some severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some people explore herbal supplements, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider before trying these, as they can sometimes cause harm.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a thorough diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
