Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives immediate tax deductions but taxes withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax outlook.
   
3. **Focus on Taxable Accounts Last**: Since taxable accounts have no tax advantages, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

Working with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
