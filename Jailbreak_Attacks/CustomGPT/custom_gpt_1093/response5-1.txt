Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions on contributions. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be triggered by selling assets for a profit.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions after securing any employer match; this can offer additional tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for savings beyond retirement accounts, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. **Investment Choices**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRAs) for investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) due to the more favorable tax treatment.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Determine an appropriate asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Stocks tend to be better suited for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds may fit better in tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds, considering tax implications to minimize your tax burden in retirement.

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your evolving financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, say 10-15% of your salary.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount each year ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate additional savings here as needed, focusing on long-term investments.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy can vary greatly depending on your individual circumstances, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your needs.
