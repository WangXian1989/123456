Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k)**:
   - Consider contributing additional funds to your 401(k) if you are in a high tax bracket. This can reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA**:
   - If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns (like bonds) or if you want more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically, especially as you approach retirement or if your financial situation changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
