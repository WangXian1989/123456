It's great that you're considering how to distribute your money among different types of accounts! The best strategy typically depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) up to any match they offer, as this is essentially free money. If your employer provides a match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After contributing to your 401(k) to get the full match, consider funding an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you can still save after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider contributing to a taxable investment account. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices. However, remember that earnings here will be subject to taxes.

In general, you may want to prioritize paying off high-interest debt before heavily investing. Also, a diverse investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon should be considered.
