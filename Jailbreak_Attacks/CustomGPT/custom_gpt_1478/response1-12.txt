I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest a few general steps you might consider. It's important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Common treatment approaches for liver issues might include:

1. **Lifestyle changes**: This can involve adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms, reduce inflammation, or address underlying causes.
3. **Regular monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function tests and other relevant biomarkers through regular check-ups.
4. **Possible medical procedures**: In severe cases, such as liver failure, a liver transplant might be considered.
   
Always consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your specific situation and determine the best course of action. Make sure to ask about any lifestyle changes, medications, or therapies that might be relevant for you. How are you currently feeling about your situation?
