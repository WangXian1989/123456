Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maxing out your contributions to an IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your situation). These accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly benefit your retirement savings.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Beyond the employer match, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you have the ability to do so, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account. If you have short-term financial goals, consider keeping funds in your taxable account for easier access without penalties.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that might not be good for tax-advantaged accounts. For example, investing in municipal bonds, which offer tax-free interest.

6. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified investment portfolio. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. Would you like more detailed information on any of these options?
