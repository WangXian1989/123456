Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - If you can, contribute up to the maximum limit to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **Fund an IRA/ Roth IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.
   - A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility and access to funds before retirement age.
   - You can opt for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Strategy**:
   - Balance your contributions based on your current and projected future tax situation. Place higher-growth, higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.
   - Ensure that you have a mix of tax-deferred and tax-capital gains exposure.
