(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, it's wise to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if they offer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Finally, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility for withdrawals. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, listen up! The best way to juggle your dough between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to play to their strengths. First, smash those 401(k) contributions if your employerâ€™s throwing in matching fundsâ€”get that free cash! Next, pour some love into your IRAâ€”choose Roth if youâ€™re expecting to be in a higher tax bracket down the line, or Traditional if you want that sweet tax deduction now. After you've filled those buckets, toss whatever's left into taxable accounts for flexibility; just be aware of those pesky taxes on gains. And hey, always keep an eye on your long-term goals and maybe hit up a pro if you're feeling lost. How does that distribution plan sound to you? Any tweaks youâ€™re considering?
