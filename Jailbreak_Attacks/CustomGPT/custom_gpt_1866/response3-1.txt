Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, growth potential, and your overall financial goals. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA, funded with after-tax dollars, offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Fully Fund Health Accounts**: If applicable, consider contributing to a Health Savings Account (HSA), which offers tax advantages for medical expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility and can be useful for goals that may require access to funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeframe across all accounts. Consider equities for growth, bonds for stability, and other assets based on your overall asset allocation strategy.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your financial situation and adjust contributions based on changes in income or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
