When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match. This is effectively "free money." Aim for at least the maximum matching contribution before allocating to other accounts.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider if you want to lower your taxable income now. This can be advantageous if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that might incur capital gains taxes, or if you need liquidity before retirement. Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Rebalancing and Diversification**
   - Ensure a diverse portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. Regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Investment Vehicles**
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to a specific set of funds. Choose low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: More flexibility. You can choose a broader array of investments, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider dividend-paying stocks or ETFs for long-term growth and reinvest dividends to enhance compounding.

### Conclusion
Evaluate your contribution limits, account types, and financial goals to create a tailored strategy. Regularly review and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial objectives. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
