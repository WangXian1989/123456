To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. 

2. **Funding Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable limit if you can, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit if you have additional funds available after your 401(k) contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investment once youâ€™ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider your age and risk tolerance. Often, these accounts offer a mix of stocks and bonds through mutual funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar approach to your 401(k), but with potentially broader investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds) or those that can benefit from long-term capital gains.

4. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how each type of account will contribute to your retirement income, being aware of tax implications for withdrawals from each.
