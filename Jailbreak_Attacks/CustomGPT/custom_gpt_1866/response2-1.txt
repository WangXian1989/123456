Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider maxing out Roth options if you're in a lower tax bracket now.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. These might be more suitable for short-term goals or down payments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k):** Typically more limited investment options; focus on a diversified mix aligned with your risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, mutual funds).
   - **IRA:** This account usually offers a wider range of investment choices; consider investing in assets that may develop long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds, ETFs) to minimize taxes on gains.

### 4. **Retirement Timeline**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and add more to taxable accounts as retirement nears.
   - **Near-Retirement Investors:** Gradually shift to more conservative investments and consider where you will withdraw funds from first post-retirement.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**
   - Keep a portion of your savings in taxable accounts for emergencies or liquidity needs.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and financial goals. Adjust contributions based on changes in income or expenses.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15% of your income until you reach the employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out your contributions if eligible (e.g., $6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

Ultimately, tailor your strategy to your unique situation, possibly consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
