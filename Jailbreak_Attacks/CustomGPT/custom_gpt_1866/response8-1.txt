Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Distributions from a Traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as regular income in retirement, whereas Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals. Balance your contributions accordingly to manage your future tax burden.

3. **Consider Your Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - Short-term needs (like buying a house or emergency funds) should go into taxable accounts or savings accounts. Long-term investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate higher taxable income, like bonds or REITs, and keep growth-focused investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to evenly distribute your savings throughout the year, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions, life changes, or shifts in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
