Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions for contributions.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds or ETFs) since you pay capital gains tax when selling.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for short-term goals, or when you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and age.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy to your 401(k), but consider using it for more aggressive investments.
   - **Taxable**: Keep a more conservative approach here, focusing on tax-efficient investments to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Balance and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Connecting with a financial planner can provide tailored advice based on your circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Retirement Accounts**: 70% (split between 401(k) and IRA)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

This is just a guideline; always consider your own personal situation when making these decisions.
