Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free” money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings.
   - Invest in assets that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Investment Timeline**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - Shorter-term goals may lean more towards taxable accounts for easier access to funds.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Strategically decide between traditional and Roth accounts based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts will be taxed at your regular income tax rate in retirement.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial objectives and maximizes tax efficiency.
