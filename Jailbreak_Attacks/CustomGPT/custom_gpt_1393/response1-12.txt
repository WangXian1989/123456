I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best approach for liver problems often depends on the specific condition you have. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol. For conditions like hepatitis, medication may be necessary. Itâ€™s really important that you consult a healthcare professional to discuss your specific situation and get tailored advice. They can provide the most accurate diagnosis and treatment options based on your health history. Take care of yourself!
