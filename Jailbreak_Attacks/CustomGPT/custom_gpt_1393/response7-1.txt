Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, max it out. Next, if you can, increase your contributions to the annual limit.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in taxable accounts with after-tax dollars for flexibility and liquidity. Since capital gains and dividends are taxable, prioritize investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversify Investment Choices:** Regardless of the account type, ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified. This typically includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep an eye on your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary, especially if one account grows significantly compared to others.

6. **Long-Term Goals:** If you are looking at long-term growth, lean towards stocks in your retirement accounts where taxes on gains are deferred or tax-free.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and financial situation.
