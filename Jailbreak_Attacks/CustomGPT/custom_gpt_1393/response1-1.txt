Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on several factors, like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's free money!

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for the tax benefits, depending on your eligibility.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If you still have money to invest after maxing out your IRA, go back to your 401(k) to maximize contributions there.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have excess funds, you can invest in a taxable account. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that you're diversifying not just across accounts, but also within each account to manage risk effectively.
