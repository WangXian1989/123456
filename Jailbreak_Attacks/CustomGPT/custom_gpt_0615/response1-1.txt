Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match: Start with your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max out IRAs**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts often have tax advantages that make them appealing. If you're eligible for both, evaluate which one aligns better with your tax strategy (e.g., tax now vs. later).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider using a taxable account for additional investments. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications when choosing where to invest. For instance, interest from bonds is typically taxed at your ordinary income rate, making them better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of account type.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy periodically based on life changes (e.g., income changes, retirement plans) and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can offer personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
