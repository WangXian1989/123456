Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income level, tax bracket, and financial goals. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum allowed if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is advantageous if you believe your tax rate will increase in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or if you expect to need access to funds before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for profit.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Utilize your retirement accounts for long-term growth investments, like stocks or mutual funds, to benefit from compound growth and tax advantages.
   - In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments like index funds or bonds, which may generate lower capital gains distributions.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified among various asset classes across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in a tax-efficient manner. Generally, depleting taxable accounts first while allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer is a common strategy.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and to stay updated with any tax law changes.
