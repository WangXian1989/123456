Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Understand the Accounts

- **401(k):** Often has employer matching, pre-tax contributions, and potentially high contribution limits.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages, but with limits on contributions. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Provide flexibility for withdrawals but don’t have the same tax advantages. Capital gains tax applies.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions

- **Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After the match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged options, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds).

### 3. Consider Tax Implications

- **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains tax.
- **401(k) and IRA:** Be aware of withdrawal taxes; pre-tax accounts will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.

### 4. Adjust Based on Goals

- **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for access.
- **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on maxing out retirement accounts for growth and tax benefits.

### 5. Review and Rebalance

- Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your retirement goals and adjust as needed based on market performance and life changes.

### Summary

1. Max out employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to an IRA (consider Roth for tax-free growth).
3. Use taxable accounts for flexibility and additional savings.
