Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on income limits and tax strategy).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which means you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with post-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits and dividend income annually.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Diversify investments similarly to your 401(k). You might choose different asset classes here for further diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is a good place for investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically across accounts to ensure alignment with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution strategy is personalized. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
