(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally, hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can afford to, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals or once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Okay, letâ€™s break it down! The goal is to make your money work for you while keeping the tax man at bay. Hereâ€™s a kickass strategy:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer matches contributions, throw as much cash into your 401(k) as you canâ€”donâ€™t leave that sweet free money on the table!

2. **IRA Action**: Next, hit up an IRA. A traditional IRA gives you that sweet tax deduction now, while a Roth is like a tax-free party down the road. Best to split your focus and max out contributions to both types if you can swing it.

3. **Pump Up the 401(k)**: Once that's squared away, go back to your 401(k) and finish maxing it out. Youâ€™ll thank yourself later when all that money grows tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Extra Firepower**: Lastly, eye those taxable accounts for anything beyond your retirement goals. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and you can access your cash whenever.

5. **Keep It Diverse, Baby**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! Mix it up across accounts to keep your portfolio healthy and resilient.

And yeah, think about hitting up a financial advisor if you want to dive deeper into your specific situationâ€”better safe than sorry, my friend!
