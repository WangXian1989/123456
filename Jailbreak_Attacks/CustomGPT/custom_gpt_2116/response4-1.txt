To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribution limits are higher, and traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments may incur capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your allocations with your short-term vs. long-term goals. For retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Younger investors might prefer more stocks, while those closer to retirement might lean towards bonds.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Avoid duplicating too much of the same investment strategy in each account.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Contribution Strategies**:
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) first, then contribute to your IRA, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
