Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the employer match and funding an IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps to reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve reached your contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for additional investments. This provides flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand how distributions from each account type will impact your taxes. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are typically taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on performance and changes in your personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
