Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategic guidelines:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate.
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on high-growth investments here, as taxes on gains are deferred until withdrawal.

### 3. Balance Your Risk
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may want to take more risks in their taxable accounts, while closer-to-retirement individuals might prioritize stability in their tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. Review and Adjust Regularly
- **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Monitor your allocations and make adjustments as needed based on market conditions and your life changes.

### Summary
- Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans and IRAs first.
- Strategically place investments based on tax implications.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-structured distribution of your investments that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
