Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 for those under 50 (and $30,500 for those 50 and older). Maximize contributions if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose between a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The annual limit for IRA contributions is $6,500 (and $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2024). Consider maxing this out if your budget allows.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility for short and medium-term goals. Keep in mind taxes on capital gains and dividends.
   - **Investing Strategy**: Focus on long-term investments to minimize tax impacts. Consider tax-efficient funds or strategies for this account.

### Suggested Order of Contributions
1. **401(k)** up to the employer match
2. **IRA** to max out contributions
3. **401(k)** again, maximizing contributions if possible
4. **Taxable account** for additional savings or investment opportunities

### Rebalancing and Monitoring
Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals, and be mindful of any changes in tax laws that could affect your strategy.
