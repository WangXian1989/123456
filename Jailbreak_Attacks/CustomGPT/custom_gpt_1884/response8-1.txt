When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold investments with the highest potential for growth (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to reduce tax liabilities.

3. **Debt Considerations**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before contributing more to your investment accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses, which should be separate from your investment accounts.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to each account to stay consistent with your investment strategy.

6. **Adjust According to Age**:
   - As you get closer to retirement, shift more assets into safer investments (like bonds) in your 401(k) and IRA, while keeping growth-focused investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help align your investment strategy with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

By balancing contributions based on these considerations, you can create a strategic approach to managing your investments effectively.
