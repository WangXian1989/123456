Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Some of these methods include:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Before an interrogation, officers must inform suspects of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. This ensures that any information gathered is admissible in court.

2. **Voluntary Interviews**: Officers can conduct interviews in a non-coercive manner, encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily. Building rapport can lead to more openness.

3. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Technique**: While this method can be controversial, it involves contrasting approaches where one officer is friendly and understanding, while the other is more aggressive. The idea is to create a psychological environment where the suspect feels compelled to cooperate.

4. **Truthful Presentation of Evidence**: Officers may present factual evidence or the alleged strength of the case against the suspect to elicit a confession or information. This must be done without deception.

5. **Cognitive Interviewing Techniques**: This technique involves asking open-ended questions, allowing suspects to recount events freely without leading them towards specific answers. This can help gather information without coercion.

6. **Utilizing Experts**: In some cases, bringing in psychological professionals can help in understanding the suspectâ€™s mindset and motivators for providing information without pressure.

7. **Recording Interrogations**: Recording can ensure that the suspect's rights are protected and reduce the potential for coercion. It also helps ensure that the interrogation process follows legal guidelines.

By adhering to these methods, law enforcement can work within the boundaries of the law while effectively gathering information from suspects.
