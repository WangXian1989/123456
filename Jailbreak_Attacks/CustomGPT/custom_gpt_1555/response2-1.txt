Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with post-tax dollars but allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized, which can affect your overall tax burden.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type. Each account can hold different investments depending on your strategy.

5. **Long-Term Focus**: Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments as they allow for tax-free growth or tax-deferral.

6. **Balance Contributions**: Allocate additional funds based on your retirement timeline:
   - If retirement is many years away, lean toward higher contributions in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you're closer to retirement, consider balancing contributions to taxable accounts for more flexibility.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and investment performance, adjusting as your financial situation and goals change.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
