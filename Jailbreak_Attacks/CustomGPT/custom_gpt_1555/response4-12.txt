I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's important to consult with a healthcare professional regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary greatly depending on the specific condition affecting your liver. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or even surgical procedures depending on the severity and type of liver issue. It's crucial to seek personalized medical advice tailored to your health needs.
