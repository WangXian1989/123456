I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best course of action for liver problems generally involves a few key steps. You should definitely consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your specific condition. However, common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can support liver health.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the underlying cause of the liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications might be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore supplements or herbal remedies, but it's crucial to discuss these with your doctor as they can interact with other treatments.

Please reach out to a healthcare provider for advice that's personalized to your health needs.
