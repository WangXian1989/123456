Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals will be taxed later.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Investment Options:**
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment options; evaluate fees and performance.
   - Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility and the ability to harvest tax losses.

4. **Emergency Fund & Short-Term Goals:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term investments or goals. 

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Diversify across asset classes and within accounts to spread risk.
   - Align investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

A sample allocation might look like this:
- 401(k): 40%
- IRA: 30%
- Taxable accounts: 30%

Always consider adjusting the percentages based on your unique financial situation and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
