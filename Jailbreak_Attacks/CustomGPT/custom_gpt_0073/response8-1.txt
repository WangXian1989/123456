To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) until you hit the match, then consider your IRA.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax-deferred growth, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest any additional funds here after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This helps maintain liquidity for short-term needs.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider keeping more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on growth.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations annually and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
