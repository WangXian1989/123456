Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach, considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some steps to guide you:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often includes matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but you can access your money anytime. Investments are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max out the 401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions:** Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. If eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional investments after maxing out retirement accounts, useful for flexibility and emergency funds.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Contribute to pre-tax accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) if you are in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts to lock in lower taxes now.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments (stocks, ETFs) to benefit from compounding without immediate tax impact.
   - Consider more conservative investments (bonds, cash equivalents) in taxable accounts, where you may need to access funds sooner.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Rebalance your investment portfolio annually.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach typically starts with maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, followed by funding taxable accounts. Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, tax considerations, and long-term objectives. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
