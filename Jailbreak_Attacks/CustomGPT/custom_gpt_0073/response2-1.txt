Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate. They also provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on age and risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies before locking away funds in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically assess and adjust your contributions and allocations based on your changing financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15%-20% of income (max contributions)
- **IRA:** Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation, as they can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.
