To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Focus**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for short-term needs or investments.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are:
     - **401(k)**: $23,000 (plus $7,500 if age 50+).
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (plus $1,000 if age 50+).

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Tax treatment depends on whether it's a traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments will be subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - Reassess your distribution strategy regularly to align with changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: Max up to employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit, prioritizing Roth if tax-free growth is a goal.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds, focusing on tax-efficient strategies.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
- Personal circumstances vary widely; a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Following these steps allows you to optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
