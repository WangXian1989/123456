I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you can discuss with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver issue (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**:
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly benefit liver health.

4. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and health.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

6. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may explore herbal supplements, but itâ€™s important to consult a doctor before starting any new treatment.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
