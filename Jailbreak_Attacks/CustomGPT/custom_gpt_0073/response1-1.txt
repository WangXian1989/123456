To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high employer match, prioritize contributions here.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on:
   - Index funds or ETFs for lower capital gains taxes.
   - Municipal bonds, which are often tax-exempt.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Adjust your contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets. 

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments within each account according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.

Tailoring your approach to your financial situation and goals will yield the best results.
