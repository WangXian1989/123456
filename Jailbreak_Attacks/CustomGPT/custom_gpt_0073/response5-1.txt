When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA. Take advantage of employer matches in your 401(k) if available.
   - **IRA Types**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current tax situation and expected retirement tax rate.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Income-Generating Assets in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds) and funds that throw off dividends in your taxable accounts, as these can be taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Order of Withdrawals**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains and dividend taxes when deciding which accounts to withdraw from.

### 4. **Review Regularly**
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
   - **Adjust Contributions**: As your income and expenses change, adjust your contributions to maximize tax benefits.

### Key Considerations
- **Tax Brackets**: Understand your tax brackets to optimize withdrawals and contributions.
- **Retirement Goals**: Align your strategy with your long-term financial goals.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions and investments across these accounts with a focus on maximizing tax efficiency and growth potential can set you up for a healthier financial future. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
