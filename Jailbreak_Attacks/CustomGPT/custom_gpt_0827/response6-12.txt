I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medical Treatments:**
   - **Medications:** Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.
   - **Regular Check-ups:** Monitoring liver function tests to assess any progression or improvement.

3. **Avoiding Toxins:**
   - Limit alcohol intake and avoid substances that can further harm the liver.

4. **Hydration:**
   - Drinking plenty of water helps maintain liver health.

It's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
