Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, prioritize contributions here next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide taxable income deductions.

### 3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a savings account.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for shorter-term goals and can be more tax-efficient with the right investment choices (e.g., ETFs, index funds).

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawals:**
   - Plan for how and when you might withdraw from each account during retirement, as this can impact your tax situation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If unsure, consulting a professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

### Summary:
Start with the 401(k) to capture the match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally utilize taxable accounts for additional investments. Always keep an eye on your overall financial goals and tax implications.
