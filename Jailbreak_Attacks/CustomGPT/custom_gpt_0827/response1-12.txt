I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's really important to consult a healthcare professional. They might consider treatment options like lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), medications, or procedures depending on the specific liver condition. They could also recommend regular monitoring and follow-ups to manage your health effectively. Always get personalized advice from a medical expert!
