Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum limit if possible, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth accounts are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility. You can withdraw funds without penalties, and it may be beneficial for short-term goals.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, that generate fewer taxable events.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and return.
   - Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from capital gains taxes.

4. **Monitor Your Asset Allocation**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about how withdrawals will impact your tax bracket and overall retirement income.
   - Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts like IRAs, and lastly, any tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs to minimize taxes over time.
