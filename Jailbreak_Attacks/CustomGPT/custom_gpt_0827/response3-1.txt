Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Monitor capital gains in taxable accounts and consider tax-loss harvesting. Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

6. **Regular Review:** Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.
