(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on maximizing your contributions within the allowed limits.

2. **IRA**: Consider using a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, traditional IRAs can be beneficial for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains and dividends, where you may want to be strategic about realizing gains and losses.

Overall, aim for a balanced approach, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first and then considering your taxable accounts for additional investments.

1. **401(k)**: Max that sucker out, especially if your employer matchesâ€”itâ€™s like free cash. Put in enough to get that full match, then crank it up to the limit if you can handle it.

2. **IRA**: Go for a Roth if you canâ€”future tax-free growth! If you're drowning in current tax worries, a traditional IRA is a solid pick. Just remember, with a Roth, youâ€™ll thank yourself when you're chilling in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your playground. Use these for longer-term investments where you can be savvy about taxes. Think capital gains and dividends! Pulling money wisely from here can balance your taxable income over time.

In short, stack up those tax-advantaged accounts first and funnel anything extra into taxable. Keep it dynamic and adjust as your needs change!
