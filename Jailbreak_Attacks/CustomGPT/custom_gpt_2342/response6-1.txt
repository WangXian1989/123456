When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Assessing Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that yield lower capital gains, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax burdens.
- **Asset Allocation**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on significant gains. 

### 3. Create a Balanced Portfolio
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your investment goals.

### Conclusion
Consider these strategies tailored to your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
