Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's free money!

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider the limits. If you have a high-income scenario, a traditional 401(k) can help reduce taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you're eligible, contribute up to the limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond retirement accounts. They offer flexibility and can be good for short- to mid-term goals. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax hit.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying investments within each type of account.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on changing goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation!
