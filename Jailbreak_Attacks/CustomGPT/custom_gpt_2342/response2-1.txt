Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match, then consider maxing out your contribution limit if you can.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth (depending on your income level and tax situation).
   - Contribute the maximum amount allowed annually, focusing on the type of IRA that best fits your financial situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these accounts for investments that may generate more taxable income (like bonds) or for short-term goals, as you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability.

4. **Balance:**
   - Keep in mind your risk tolerance and investment horizon when allocating assets across these accounts.
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

**Additional Tips:**
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, then allocate funds to taxable accounts.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help optimize growth while minimizing taxes over the long term.
