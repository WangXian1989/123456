Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, deferring taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**
   - Ensure you're aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (2024) with additional catch-up contributions if you're 50+.
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (2024), with catch-up contributions for those 50+.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks, as these accounts can benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Your Time Horizon**
   - If retirement is far off, lean towards higher-risk, higher-reward investments. As you approach retirement, gradually shift to safer, more stable investments.

### Summary
1. Maximize 401(k) contributions, especially with an employer match.
2. Fund your IRA for additional tax advantages.
3. Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, prioritizing tax-efficient investments.
