Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially for tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for goals that are short-term or need flexibility.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - For long-term growth, lean towards more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term needs, prioritize safer investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changing goals, market conditions, and life events.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (up to match)
- **IRA**: $6,500/year (or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds after maxing out the above.

### Consultation
- Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation. 

This balanced approach helps grow your wealth while minimizing taxes over time.
