Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial situation and goals. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Advantages**: Often has employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth.
   - **Disadvantages**: Limited investment options, penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Strategy**: Maximize employer match and consider contributing up to the annual limit.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions; taxes paid on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions made with after-tax dollars; tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Strategy**: Choose based on your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Advantages**: Flexibility in withdrawals, no contribution limits.
   - **Disadvantages**: Tax on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Strategy**: Use for short-term goals or as a source of funds before retirement.

### **General Allocation Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a safety net outside of these accounts.
- **Aggressive Growth**: Prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages (401(k), IRA).
- **Diversification**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.

### **Example Distribution Approach**
1. **Max out 401(k)** up to company match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably a Roth if you qualify).
3. **Fund a taxable account** with any surplus cash after maximizing tax-advantaged contributions.

### **Consult a Professional**
Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation and goals.
