Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be strategically planned based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - Depending on your eligibility (Roth vs. Traditional), prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions for tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

### 3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**
   - After maxing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you’re in a lower tax bracket.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement. Investments in these accounts should be in lower tax-impact assets (like index funds or ETFs).

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Focus on stocks for growth in retirement accounts and consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 6. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Use tax-loss harvesting where applicable.

### 7. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Review your distribution strategy annually or when your financial situation changes.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 20% of income (up to the match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (currently $6,500/yr; $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10-20% of remaining income

### Conclusion
Tailor these recommendations to your unique situation, including your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
