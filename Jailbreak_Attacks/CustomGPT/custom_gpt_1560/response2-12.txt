I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. Common approaches for liver health issues may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, exercise, abstaining from alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications may also be prescribed if needed, depending on the specific liver condition. Regular monitoring through blood tests and imaging studies could be necessary. Please reach out to a medical professional for personalized advice.
