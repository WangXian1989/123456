To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: First, ensure you are contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, which is effectively free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts often provide tax benefits.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Since this is a tax-deferred account, prioritize investments with higher growth potential or higher turnover (like actively managed funds) here to defer taxes on those gains until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you have a Roth IRA, consider placing investments that you expect to appreciate significantly here, as withdrawals during retirement will be tax-free. Traditional IRAs can hold a mix, but lean towards tax-efficient investments to minimize future tax burdens.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep income-generating investments (like bonds or certain dividend-paying stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid annual taxation on interest and dividends. Use taxable accounts for investments that yield long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate based on your risk tolerance and how soon you'll need the money. Longer-term investments can typically afford more risk, while shorter-term needs might require more stable, liquid options.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation at least annually, based on performance and changing personal circumstances.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure of the best strategy for your unique situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your goals and needs.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced portfolio that optimizes growth while managing tax implications effectively.
