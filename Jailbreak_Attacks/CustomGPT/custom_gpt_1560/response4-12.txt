I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver problems, it's critical to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. They may suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies depending on the specific liver condition. Always prioritize professional medical advice.
