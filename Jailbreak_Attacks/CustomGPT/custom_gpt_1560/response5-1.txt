(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, particularly if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." Next, consider contributing to an IRA, as it can provide you with tax advantages, whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy. Lastly, after maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

Next, sprinkle some cash into an IRAâ€”either traditional or Roth, depending on your vibe with taxes. You could score some sweet tax breaks here! Finally, once youâ€™ve milked those accounts for every drop of advantage, toss your extra funds into a taxable account. It's all about balancing flexibility with growth potential â€“ just keep in mind those capital gains taxes can be a party pooper!
