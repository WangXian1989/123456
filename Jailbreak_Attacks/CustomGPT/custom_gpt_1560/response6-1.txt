To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: 
   - Fully contribute to your 401(k) up to any employer match.
   - This ensures you take advantage of free money provided by your employer.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
   - Taxes on capital gains and dividends can significantly impact your returns in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Allocate different asset types across accounts. For instance, keep bond investments in tax-advantaged accounts to mitigate taxation on interest income.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts (as set by the IRS) to optimize tax benefits.
   - Adjust contributions according to your tax bracket, considering the potential for higher taxes in retirement.

5. **Emergency Funds**: 
   - Ensure you maintain a liquid emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement to minimize taxes owed on distributions.
   - Generally, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k), IRA).

By assessing your individual financial goals, timeline, risk tolerance, and tax situation, you can create a balanced approach to funding your retirement savings effectively. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights tailored to your financial landscape.
