I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and regular exercise. Medications could be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition, and in some cases, procedures or surgery may be necessary. Regular monitoring and follow-up with a healthcare provider are crucial. Always seek medical advice tailored to your situation.
