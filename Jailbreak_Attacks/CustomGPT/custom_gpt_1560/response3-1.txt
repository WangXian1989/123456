When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit to benefit from tax-deferred growth. If you're over 50, consider making catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA**: If eligible (check rules regarding income limits for tax deductions), max out your IRA contributions as well for additional tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate additional funds to a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals but remember you will be taxed on any capital gains.

4. **Consider Expenses and Investment Options**: Evaluate the fees and investment options available in your 401(k) vs. an IRA and choose based on potential growth and costs. IRAs often provide a broader selection of investments.

5. **Assess Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Allocate funds based on your financial goals, whether it’s growing wealth, saving for retirement, or short-term goals. Higher-risk investments may be more suitable for longer timelines. 

6. **Revisit Annually**: Regularly review your allocation strategy against market changes, your financial situation, and retirement goals to ensure you’re on track.

By following these tips, you can develop a balanced approach to distributing your money that aligns with both your short-term liquidity needs and long-term investment goals.
