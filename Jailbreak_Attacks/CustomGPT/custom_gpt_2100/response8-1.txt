Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) to take advantage of tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals later will be taxed as ordinary income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally, these are more flexible for withdrawals. Funds can be accessed anytime without penalties, but youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically hold higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) since theyâ€™re tax-advantaged and you wonâ€™t pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, aiming to minimize tax liabilities. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Consider Your Individual Goals**:
   - Tailor your strategy based on your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and whether you plan to leave a legacy (which may influence how you manage taxable accounts).

### 6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and changing tax laws.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions and investments across these accounts while being mindful of tax implications can optimize your retirement savings.
