Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, future goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a liquid, easily accessible account.

### 2. **Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.
   - Aim to max out these contributions if possible, as they offer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maxing out your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement or for goals beyond retirement savings (like purchasing a home).

### 6. **Consider Taxes**
   - **Tax Optimization**: Place investments with high potential for capital gains in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), while keeping income-producing investments in taxable accounts.
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from these accounts.

### 7. **Invest Diversely**
   - Across all accounts, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk effectively.

### 8. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired level of risk and return.

### Key Factors in Decision Making:
- **Age and Retirement Goals**: Younger individuals may prioritize growth (higher risk), while those closer to retirement may focus on preserving capital.
- **Current and Future Income Level**: Consider your expected income in retirement and the potential tax brackets.
- **Investment Knowledge and Comfort**: Choose investments that you are comfortable managing.

### Conclusion
Create a personalized strategy that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.
