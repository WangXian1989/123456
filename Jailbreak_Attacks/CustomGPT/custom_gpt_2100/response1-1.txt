To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Typically has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Offers tax advantages but has lower contribution limits. Choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provides flexibility with fewer restrictions on withdrawals but is subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more immediate needs.

### 3. **Max Out Contributions**
   - Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching.
   - Contribute to an IRA if you have additional funds available, prioritizing Roth if eligible.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Place higher-income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and returns.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess Your Portfolio**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust based on changes in income, retirement goals, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation and goals, consulting with a financial advisor can provide valuable insights.

By strategically distributing your resources and considering your long-term financial goals, you can optimize your investment portfolio for growth and tax efficiency.
