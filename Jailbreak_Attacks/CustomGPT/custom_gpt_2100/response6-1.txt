To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching; ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Also tax-advantaged, with Roth IRAs allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Do not have tax benefits but offer flexibility; good for accessing funds before retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for their tax advantages if you're aiming for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and immediate access.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available), as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions to your IRA, especially if you are eligible for a Roth IRA.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, allocate investments across accounts with a suitable diversification strategy.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust asset allocation in each account periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on growing high-income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
   - **Capital Gains**: Use taxable accounts for investments that incur lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan withdrawals from your 401(k) and IRA strategically to minimize tax implications during retirement.
   - Utilize taxable accounts first for short-term needs to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

### Conclusion:
Allocating money among these different accounts should align with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed.
