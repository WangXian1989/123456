I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some commonly considered options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt can support liver health. Foods rich in antioxidants, like fruits and vegetables, are beneficial.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce liver fat and inflammation.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve overall health and help manage weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to treat infections, reduce inflammation, or manage symptoms.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In cases of severe liver damage or failure, procedures such as endoscopy or surgeries may be necessary.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Reducing alcohol consumption and avoiding exposure to harmful chemicals can prevent further liver damage.

5. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any issues early.

6. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In cases of severe liver failure, a transplant may be the only option.

Always consult your doctor to discuss your symptoms, get a proper diagnosis, and develop a treatment plan tailored to your condition.
