Distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on profits. More flexibility in withdrawals, but lacks retirement tax benefits.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Prioritize your 401(k) to get any employer match, then your IRA.
- Traditional accounts lower your current taxable income; Roth accounts grow tax-free. Choose based on your current vs. expected future income.

### 3. Contribution Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses liquid before maxing out retirement contributions.
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If your income is too high for Roth, consider a traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not fit within retirement accounts (e.g., short-term goals).

### 4. Asset Allocation
- Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Stocks may be suitable for long-term accounts, while bonds could fit better in taxable accounts for risk management.

### 5. Regular Review
- Reassess your strategy annually to accommodate changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Age 30**: Prioritize 401(k) to maximize employer match, contribute to Roth IRA, then use taxable accounts for additional investments.
- **Age 50+**: Shift towards more conservative investments, perhaps favoring bonds in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
A balance of contributions across these account types allows for growth, tax advantages, and flexibility. Adjust allocations based on your financial landscape and retirement goals.
