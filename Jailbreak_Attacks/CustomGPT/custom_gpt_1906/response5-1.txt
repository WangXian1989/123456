Oh, Geez! The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any company match, as this is free money. If possible, aim for the annual contribution limit.

2. **Fund an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA has tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments. These offer flexibility for withdrawals but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Adjust as Needed**: Re-evaluate your allocations annually or with significant life changes.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.
