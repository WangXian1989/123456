Oh, Geez! The best strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money.
   - **IRA:** If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs, as capital gains can be taxed annually.
   - **401(k) and IRA Distributions:** Remember that withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, so plan for this in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate across asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Adjust allocations periodically based on market conditions and personal needs.

4. **Balance Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies; retirement accounts have penalties for early withdrawal.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your overall investment strategy and grow your wealth effectively. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
