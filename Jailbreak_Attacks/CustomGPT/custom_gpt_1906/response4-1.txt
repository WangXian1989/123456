Oh, Geez! The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k) in terms of tax benefits upfront.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth (like stocks), and taxable accounts for more liquidity (like bonds or dividend stocks).

4. **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain an adequate emergency fund in easily accessible accounts before investing heavily.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds based on your timeline for needing access to that money. Long-term investments can afford more risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice based on your specific situation can help optimize your strategy.

Adjust the allocation regularly to reflect changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
