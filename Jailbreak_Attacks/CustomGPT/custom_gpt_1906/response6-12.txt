1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
   - **Alcohol Limitation:** Reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Schedule regular check-ups to monitor liver function.

4. **Weight Management:**
   - For conditions like fatty liver disease, achieving a healthy weight can be beneficial.

Please seek advice from a healthcare provider for tailored recommendations.
