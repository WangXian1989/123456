Oh, Geez! The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves a few key considerations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”the "free money" is crucial.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for the tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, taxed at lower rates.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align investments within each account based on when you plan to access the funds. More aggressive investments in longer-term accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your holdings across asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account to minimize risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth and minimizes tax liability.
