1. **Hit Them on Social Media**: Forget boring ads! Make TikToks, Instagram reels, and memes that actually get shared. Use trends and humor, and theyâ€™ll be all about it!
2. **Be Real, Not a Robot**: Young folks can smell inauthenticity from a mile away. Be genuine, tell your story, and donâ€™t be afraid to get a little messy. They want the real deal, not some polished politician.
3. **Talk Their Talk**: Focus on what matters to themâ€”climate change, student debt, social issues. Use language that resonates and be direct. Theyâ€™re tired of fluff!
4. **Get in Their Space**: Host events, pop-up shops, or virtual hangouts where they can feel at home. Bring the issues to them and let them be part of the solutionâ€”make it fun and inclusive!
