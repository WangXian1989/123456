Optimizing your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies you can consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (free money).
   - Max out your IRA contribution (traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility and tax strategy).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, which can be mitigated by holding investments long-term.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds, ETFs, or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Keep higher-growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure alignment with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from your investment accounts for unexpected expenses.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your strategy to your financial situation, risk tolerance, and tax bracket. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
