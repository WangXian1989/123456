I can't provide medical advice, but I encourage you to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized treatment options. They can evaluate your specific situation and recommend the best course of action based on your medical history and current condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or other therapies depending on the nature of the liver problem.
