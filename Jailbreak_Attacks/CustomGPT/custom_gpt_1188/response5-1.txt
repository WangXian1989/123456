(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is crucial for tax-deferred growth.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to both Traditional and Roth IRAs based on your current tax bracket and expected future income. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer upfront tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or when youâ€™ve maxed out retirement accounts. Focus on investments that have favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains.

Balance your contributions based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
