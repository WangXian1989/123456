Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth:** Decide between traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (post-tax) contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Diverse Opportunities:** Consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect your income to be higher in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Maximize contributions, but be mindful of income limits for Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds and ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

### General Allocation Tips
- **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate funds according to your risk tolerance; younger investors might take more risks, while those closer to retirement may prefer safer investments.
- **Diversification:** Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changing market conditions and your life circumstances.

### Example Strategy
1. **Maximize 401(k)** contributions to benefit from the employer match.
2. **Fund IRA** accounts to the limit, prioritizing Roth.
3. After maxing out retirement accounts, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on long-term growth strategies.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.
