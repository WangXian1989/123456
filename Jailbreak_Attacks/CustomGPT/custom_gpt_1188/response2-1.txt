Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions (401(k)):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts offer tax benefits (tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in the case of Roth accounts). Contributing to these can lower your taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket upon retirement, consider a Roth IRA. If you think your tax rate will be lower, a Traditional IRA may be better.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Taxable accounts can be ideal for short-term goals or when you may need access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts:**
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Consider more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** As market conditions change, ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Professional advice can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Strategy:
- Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth, if eligible).
- Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Evaluate your progress annually and adjust based on life changes and market conditions.
