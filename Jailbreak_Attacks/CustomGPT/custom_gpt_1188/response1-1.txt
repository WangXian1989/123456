Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize contributions to these accounts within the annual limits (e.g., for 2023, $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs).

### 4. **Build Up Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing retirement accounts, consider investing additional funds in a taxable account. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals and access to your funds without penalties.

### 5. **Asset Allocation and Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments reflect your financial goals and risk tolerance. Typically, stocks may be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for capital gains tax benefits, while bonds might be more suited for taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 6. **Stay Liquid for Short-Term Needs**
   - Keep sufficient funds in accessible accounts to cover short-term expenses or emergencies without needing to tap into retirement accounts.

### 7. **Revisit and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and allocation to ensure they align with your goals, especially as you age or your financial situation changes.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Lastly, consider speaking with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match + potential maximum contribution.
- **IRA**: Based on your tax situation, consider a Traditional or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional funds after maxing the above accounts.

This diversified approach balances long-term growth potential with tax efficiency and accessibility.
