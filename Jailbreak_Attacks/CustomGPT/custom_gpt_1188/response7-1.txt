Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great place to start.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income level and participation in other retirement plans.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. This account can be useful for funds you may need before retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all three accounts to manage risk while aiming for growth.

### 4. **Assess Liquidity Needs:**
   - If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, prioritize contributions to your taxable accounts, as 401(k)s and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawals.

### 5. **Evaluate Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - If retirement is far off, consider investing more aggressively in your 401(k) and IRA. As retirement approaches, gradually shift towards more conservative investments.

### 6. **Annual Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Prioritize contributions up to the limits, especially for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution Approach:
1. **401(k):** Max out contributions up to the employer match.
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute at least to the maximum allowed limit, depending on your eligibility.
3. **Taxable Account:** Use any additional funds to invest in a taxable account.

### Summary
Every individual's situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific financial goals and needs.
