To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Target Percentage:** Generally, contribute at least 5-10% of your salary, adjusting based on your financial goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 per individual (or $7,500 if aged 50 or older).

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account.
   - **Investment Choices:** In taxable accounts, consider investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth vs. Income:** Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts for growth and lower-risk, income-generating assets in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Withdrawal Strategies:** Plan withdrawals from these accounts strategically in retirement to minimize tax impacts.
   - **Tax Brackets:** Be aware of your current tax bracket and how different accounts might affect your tax situation.

### Summary 
By balancing contributions across these accounts while considering tax implications and investment goals, you can create a well-rounded financial strategy for long-term growth and stability.
