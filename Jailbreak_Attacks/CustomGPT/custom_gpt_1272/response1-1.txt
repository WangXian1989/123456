Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Good for higher contribution limits and tax deferral.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need access to before retirement. Theyâ€™re also good for investments that benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts. Hold bonds and high-yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest and dividends.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Your Next Steps**: Think about your retirement timeline and goals. Adjust your strategy accordingly.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your situation.
