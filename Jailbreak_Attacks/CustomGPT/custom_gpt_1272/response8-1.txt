To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-income years, prioritize maxing out your 401(k), especially if it has lower fees.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible. Contributions to a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement age. 
   - You can also use them for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for lower tax rates.

4. **Asset Location**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower taxes on capital gains.

5. **Review Regularly**: Regularly reassess your portfolio and contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Keep an eye on fees associated with each account to maximize returns.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
