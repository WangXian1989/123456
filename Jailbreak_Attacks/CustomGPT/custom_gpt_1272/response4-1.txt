To maximize your investment strategy, consider these general guidelines for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax Deferral**: 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial. If lower, consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are closer in time, as these accounts provide liquidity.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review and adjust asset allocation to maintain your investment strategy based on market conditions and personal goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
