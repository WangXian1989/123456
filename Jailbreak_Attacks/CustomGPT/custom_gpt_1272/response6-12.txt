Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem specifically. General treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and reduce intake of fatty foods.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on your condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or alleviate underlying issues.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.

4. **Supplementary Therapies**: 
   - Certain supplements may support liver health, but consult your doctor before starting any new regimen.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
