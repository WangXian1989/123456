Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if availableâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Assess Fund Options**: Choose funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs can be advantageous for tax-free growth.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Access**: These accounts allow for withdrawals without penalties, making them useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Investment Types**: Favor long-term investments to reduce capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

### General Distribution Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves.
2. **401(k) Contributions**: Aim for at least the employer match.
3. **IRA Contributions**: Max out contributions if possible.
4. **Additional Savings**: Invest surplus funds in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficiency.

### Additional Tips:
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
- **Consider Fees**: Be mindful of fees associated with each account type, favoring low-cost index funds where possible.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help align your strategy with your specific circumstances.

This approach helps balance growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity based on your individual financial situation.
