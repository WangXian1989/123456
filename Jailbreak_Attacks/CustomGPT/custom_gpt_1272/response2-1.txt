Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a few key considerations:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions, especially if thereâ€™s an employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Decide your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs, while retirement accounts can focus on long-term growth.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate funds based on your risk appetite. Higher risk investments can be more suitable in retirement accounts due to longer time horizons.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different asset allocations might be appropriate depending on account type.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to capture benefits before considering taxable accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max out your 401(k)** to the match limit.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably Roth if eligible).
3. **Fill contributions up to the maximum** in both accounts before utilizing taxable accounts.
4. **Use taxable accounts** for additional investments, focusing on index funds or ETFs for tax efficiency.

### Regular Review:
- Assess your investments annually to adjust for market changes and personal circumstances.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
