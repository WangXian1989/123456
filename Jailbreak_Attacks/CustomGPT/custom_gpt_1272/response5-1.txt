The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching program. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA next. A Traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, set aside money in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, riskier assets can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit more from tax deferral. More stable investments can be held in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. For instance, holding bonds (which generate ordinary income) in tax-advantaged accounts can be more beneficial than in taxable accounts.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your situation.
