To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these pros and cons along with some strategies:

### Factors to Consider:
1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to the 401(k) in that contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed in the year they're sold for capital gains. Dividends are also taxable each year.

2. **Investment Goals**: Define whether you're saving for retirement, a house, or a different goal, as this might impact your investment choices.

3. **Investment Horizon**: Consider how long you have until you need to use these funds. Longer horizons may allow for more growth-oriented investments.

### General Strategies:
1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (free money).
   - Contribute to an IRA up to its limit, focusing first on a Roth IRA if you meet the eligibility requirements and want tax-free withdrawal later.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Fund tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts, as they can grow tax-deferred.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, utilize taxable accounts for investments that may offer liquidity and flexibility, especially if you anticipate needing access to cash before retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**:
   - Spread investment types (stocks, bonds, ETFs) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and objectives. Aim for tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially to receive the employer match.
- Next, contribute to your IRA. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- After maxing those, use any additional funds for a taxable account where you might invest in tax-efficient ETFs.

### Conclusion:
There isnâ€™t a one-size-fits-all answer, as the right allocation can depend on your unique financial situation, your employer's 401(k) plan specifics, and current tax laws. Seeking guidance from a financial advisor could help develop a personalized strategy.
