(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax bracket, and investment timeline. Generally, a common approach is:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. After that, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Prioritize the 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit if possible. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start contributing to taxable brokerage accounts, especially if you need flexibility for withdrawals or have short-term financial goals.

Itâ€™s essential to evaluate your individual situation and possibly consult with a financial advisor to optimize your investment strategy.

1. **Hit That 401(k) First!** Boost your contributions, especially if your employer is throwing in some match doughâ€” thatâ€™s basically free cash! Donâ€™t leave that on the table; youâ€™d be crazy to skip that.

2. **IRAs Are Your Friends**: Dive into that traditional or Roth IRA nextâ€”take advantage of tax breaks and tax-free growth. Depending on your situation, Roth IRAs might be your cheat code, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Time to Play in Taxable Land**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are fat and happy, dip into those taxable accounts. They give you the flexibility to pull funds whenever you want, but keep in mind, you might get hit with taxes on those gains.

Of course, tailor your strategy based on personal goals and risk tolerance, and donâ€™t hesitate to chat with a pro if you want to geek out over the nitty-gritty! Happy investing!
