To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors and strategies:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which means you won't pay taxes until withdrawal. Ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or withdrawn tax-free in retirement (Roth). Consider your current vs. future tax bracket when deciding where to allocate funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxes are paid on any dividends, interest, and capital gains. Best for funds you may need before retirement or for short-term goals.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time horizons may warrant more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA, as you can ride out market fluctuations.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping funds in a taxable account or more conservative investments in the 401(k) and IRA.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (with a catch-up of $7,500 for those 50 and older). IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (with a catch-up of $1,000 for those 50 and older). Allocate accordingly.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts, which can help manage risk. Different account types can have different tax treatments, influencing your overall strategy.

**General Strategy**:
1. Maximize employer match contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially “free money.”
2. Contribute to your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
3. Once you hit the limits of these accounts, allocate additional funds to your taxable account as needed.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation. 

Happy investing!
