I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Generally, treatment options for liver problems can vary depending on the specific condition, but may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Adopt a healthy diet low in fat and sugar.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids or other immune-suppressing drugs for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups to monitor liver function and adjust treatments as necessary.
   - Blood tests to check for liver enzymes and overall health.

4. **Potential Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant might be considered.

Make sure to discuss detailed options with a healthcare provider to find the best personalized treatment plan.
