The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If possible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments as these accounts are meant for retirement. Consider a diverse mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Contributions to 401(k) and Traditional IRA lower your current taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity outside of retirement accounts for emergencies (usually 3 to 6 months of expenses).

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly:**
   - Review your investment strategy and asset allocation regularly (at least annually) and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Customization:
Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
