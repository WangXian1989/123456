To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match.
     - Aim for the annual contribution limit ($22,500 for 2024; $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA:**
     - Max out your IRA contributions ($6,500; $7,500 if age 50+).
     - Choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:**
     - Focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks, index funds).
     - Adjust risk according to your time horizon and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, municipal bonds).
     - Use this account for short-term savings or specific goals.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Withdrawal Strategies:**
     - Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - **Rebalance Periodically:**
     - Regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 4. **Continuous Contributions**
   - Keep contributing regularly to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.
   - Monitor and adjust contributions based on performance and life changes.

**Consult a financial advisor** for personalized advice considering your financial situation and goals.
