Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax treatment of each account:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deferred, so better for high-growth investments.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free withdrawals; suitable for investments expected to appreciate significantly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments generating capital gains or income that is less tax-efficient (e.g., bonds).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: Keep some investments in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, as they can be accessed easily without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your specific situation, especially regarding taxes and estate planning.

By prioritizing contributions based on these factors, you can create a balanced and efficient investment approach.
