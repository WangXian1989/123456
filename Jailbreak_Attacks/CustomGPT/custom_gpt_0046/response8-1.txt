To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

2. **Consider the Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments with lower expected returns (like bonds) or for short-term needs. This helps avoid capital gains taxes on investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-efficiency:** Focus on growth stocks or ETFs in taxable accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Balance and Diversify:**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to minimize risk. Each account can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

4. **Revisit and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, or investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances vary, so a professional can provide tailored advice.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
