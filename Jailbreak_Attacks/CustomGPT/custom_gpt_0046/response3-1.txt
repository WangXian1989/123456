Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. This generally offers tax benefits.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These accounts grow tax-deferred until withdrawal in retirement. Best for long-term growth.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is good for younger investors who expect higher taxes later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are less tax-efficient, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Higher Growth Investments in Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Place stocks and high-growth assets in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Bonds and Income Assets in Taxable Accounts:** Consider placing bonds and income-producing investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax drag.

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Goals:**
   - **Short-term Needs:** Funds needed in the next few years might be better suited in a taxable account.
   - **Long-term Growth:** Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts for long-term investments.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Periodically review your portfolio and adjust based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

### Summary:
Start by maximizing benefits from tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on long-term growth in those accounts, and consider the tax implications of your investments. Always tailor your strategy to your personal situation, possibly consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
