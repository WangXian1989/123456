Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, max out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax strategy).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Favor investments that yield lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA and 401(k) might be better. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, a Roth IRA could be advantageous.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your target asset mix across all accounts.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts have different tax implications on withdrawals.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
