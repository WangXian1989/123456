Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). IRAs can provide tax advantages that are beneficial for long-term growth.

3. **Max out 401(k)**: If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This will give you higher tax-advantaged, retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out the above options, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which can minimize capital gains distributions and taxes.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: Younger investors may focus more on growth (higher stock allocation), while those nearing retirement might prioritize income (more bonds or dividend-paying stocks).

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically for your situation.
