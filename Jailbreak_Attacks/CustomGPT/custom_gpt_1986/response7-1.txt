The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, investment preferences, and the specific rules governing each account type. Here’s a general approach to help guide your allocation:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions to take advantage of tax deferral (2023 limit is $22,500; $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (2023 limit is $6,500; $7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money that you’ll need before retirement or if you want more flexibility. Capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, especially long-term gains, so it can be beneficial for holding investments that you plan to keep for many years.

### 3. Consider Your Investment Strategy:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Match your investments to your risk tolerance within each account. More aggressive investments might be suited for retirement accounts where you're less likely to need immediate access to the funds.
   - **Rebalancing**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all account types to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 4. Review Regularly:
   - Make adjustments based on life changes, market conditions, and your evolving financial goals. Regularly consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice to optimize your distribution strategy.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15% to reach the maximum contribution limit.
- **IRA**: 10% of your income, prioritizing the account that best fits your tax strategy (Traditional vs. Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: The remaining amount for more accessible investments or emergency funds, keeping in mind your investment horizon.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual financial situation and goals.
