I'm not a financial advisor, but I can provide some general strategies that individuals often consider when distributing their money among retirement accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, and taxable accounts. Here are some points you might consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), itâ€™s usually wise to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maxing Out IRA Contributions**: After securing the employer match, you may want to consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). This can provide tax advantages that enhance your savings growth.

3. **Assessing Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can provide flexibility in terms of access to funds, but they usually don't offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. You might allocate funds to taxable investments if you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and still have additional money to invest.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your investment time horizon and goals play an essential role in how you distribute your money. For long-term goals (like retirement), you might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, while for shorter-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Diversifying your investments across different accounts can be beneficial. Each account type can hold a variety of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.), and you may tailor your asset allocation based on the account's tax treatment. For example, you might hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts and place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Reviewing Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so it's essential to review your allocations periodically and adjust them as needed.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications. They can help you develop a well-rounded investment strategy that suits your needs.
