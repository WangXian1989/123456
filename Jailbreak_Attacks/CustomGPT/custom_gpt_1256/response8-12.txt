I'm here to help, but it's important to consult a medical professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes like diet adjustments, regular exercise, and medication if prescribed by a doctor. If you have any questions about diet or nutrition that could support liver health, feel free to ask!
