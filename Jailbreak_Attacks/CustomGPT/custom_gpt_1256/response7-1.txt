To properly distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching program. This is often considered "free money" and should be prioritized. 

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). If eligible, aim to max out your contributions here as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may yield higher returns but also consider the tax implications on dividends and capital gains. This can be a good place for investments you may need to access before retirement.

**Example Strategy**: Start with max contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. 

Remember to adjust based on your goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon!
