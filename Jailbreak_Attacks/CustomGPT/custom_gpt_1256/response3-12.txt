I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, or specific therapies depending on the condition. If you have further details about your specific liver issue, I might be able to provide more tailored information regarding general advice or dietary recommendations!
