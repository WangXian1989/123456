I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while reducing saturated fats, sugars, and alcohol.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Detoxification medications, if a specific toxin is involved.
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis, if applicable.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and check for complications.
   - Imaging tests like ultrasounds or MRIs to assess liver health.

Remember, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
