(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A good strategy often involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax preference. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, especially if you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA. These funds can be accessed without penalties and may provide flexibility for short-term goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! Distributing your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like balancing a crazy game of financial Tetris. Hereâ€™s a strategy that usually rocks:

1. **Max Out that 401(k)**: If your employer matches, you need to hit that up firstâ€”it's free dough. Aim for the max contribution limit if you can swing it.
2. **IRA Next**: Depending on your situation, either a Roth or Traditional IRA is killer. Roths are awesome if you think taxes will rise and you can enjoy tax-free growth! 
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After hitting the max in your retirement accounts, throw money into taxable accounts. They donâ€™t come with the same tax perks but give you easier access when you need cash, plus you can invest in anything your heart desires!
