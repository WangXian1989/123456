Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, maximize your contributions to get the full benefit. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be more flexible but are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of funds. Often, target-date funds are good options.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you might have more investment options to choose from.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how and when you plan to withdraw funds. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k)/Traditional IRA), and lastly, tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

6. **Continuous Review**: 
   - Regularly review your allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.

It’s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
