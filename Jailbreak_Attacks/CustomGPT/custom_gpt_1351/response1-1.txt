Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match â€” it's free money!
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Offer more access to funds without penalties; useful for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and realized gains.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Retirement Accounts**: Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to the match, then fund IRAs if eligible.
- **Tax Considerations**: Use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected tax hits, like index funds.
- **Balance Risk**: Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

### Ongoing Review:
Keep an eye on your strategy as your financial situation changes and adjust contributions accordingly. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
