1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms and support liver function.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your doctor can help monitor liver health and adjust treatments as necessary.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options, including liver transplants, may be appropriate.

Please seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider for the best approach.
