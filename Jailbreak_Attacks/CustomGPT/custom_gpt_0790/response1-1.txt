When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy typically involves considering several factors such as your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how you might approach this:

1. **401(k):** If you have a 401(k), especially one with employer matching contributions, prioritize this account to maximize the match. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. The investment choices may be limited compared to IRAs, so consider the fees and performance of available options.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be advantageous because your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. A traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits through contributions, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This offers flexibility with withdrawal options and potential tax-loss harvesting strategies. Ideally, you'll want to place investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have adequate cash reserves before investing heavily in retirement accounts.
- **Tax Bracket Awareness:** Monitor your current and expected future tax brackets to optimize your strategy.
- **Retirement Timeline:** Consider how soon you plan to retire; earlier withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts may incur penalties unless exceptions apply.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation, as they can help you navigate the complexities of your financial landscape.
