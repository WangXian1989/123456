To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts since these accounts grow tax-deferred (401(k)) or tax-free (Roth IRA).

2. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

3. **Diversification**: Allocate investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals, regardless of the account type.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal; consider placing higher-growth investments here.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider making contributions here for tax-free growth; choose traditional IRA for potential tax deductions based on your income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at favorable rates compared to regular income.

5. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for performance and changing goals.

6. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account and address any high-interest debt before heavily investing.

Ultimately, consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
