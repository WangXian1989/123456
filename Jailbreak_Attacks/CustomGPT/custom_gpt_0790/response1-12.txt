I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver problems, the best step is to consult a healthcare professional who can give you personalized advice based on your specific condition. Treatment can vary widely depending on the cause of the liver issue. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, and in severe cases, a liver transplant. It's essential to work closely with a medical team to determine the best course of action for your health.
