When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to factor in several key elements: your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to think about:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income and tax filing status, consider whether a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) is more beneficial. 

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may not be as favorable in tax-advantaged accounts, such as stocks that have a high potential for capital appreciation. This allows you to strategically control when you realize gains and manage your tax liability.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate taxation. In taxable accounts, you might hold more income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals carefully in retirement to manage your tax bracket effectively. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Income Considerations**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, consider maximizing contributions to Roth accounts, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.

### A Final Note
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation. Regularly reassessing your strategy as life circumstances and tax laws change is also advised.

### General Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Contribute up to the limit
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings, focusing on long-term growth through low-commission ETFs or index funds.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across these different account types.
