Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider whether paying taxes now for tax-free growth is beneficial.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA may allow for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older). Make sure to take advantage of this space if you're eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains tax.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k)** contributions up to the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably a Roth IRA if you're eligible).
- **Utilize taxable accounts** for any additional investments once you've maxed out retirement accounts.

### Regular Review:
- **Reassess Regularly**: Your circumstances and goals may change, so review your asset allocation at least annually.

### Consult a Professional:
- If your situation is complex, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Remember, balancing growth with tax efficiency should guide your distribution strategy!
