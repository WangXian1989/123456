Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. 

### General Guidelines:
1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match since this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.
2. **Consider the Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts might be more suitable for investments that generate capital gains or dividends taxed at lower rates than ordinary income, while tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and IRA) help you grow your money without immediate tax consequences.
3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all account types based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. For instance, stocks may be better in taxable accounts for tax-efficient growth, while bonds might be more suitable in tax-advantaged accounts.
4. **Planned Withdrawals**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals can trigger taxes depending on the type.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. Max out contributions if possible.
- **IRA**: Depending on your income, choose between a Roth or traditional IRA to balance current and future tax liabilities.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, focusing on long-term growth opportunities like index funds or ETFs.

Adjust these strategies based on your specific situation, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
