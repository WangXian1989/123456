To provide the best advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need a bit more information about your financial goals, current savings, and investment timeline. Here are a few questions to consider:

1. **What is your age and how long until retirement?** This will help determine your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
2. **What are your current contributions to each account type?** Knowing how much you are putting into each account can shape the overall strategy.
3. **Do you have employer matching for your 401(k)?** This can influence how much you should prioritize contributions to it.
4. **What are your investment goals?** Are you looking to grow your wealth, save for a specific purchase, or generate income?
5. **What is your current tax situation?** Understanding your tax bracket can help determine the best account to focus on.

Once I have this context, I can give you tailored advice on how to best allocate your investments! Happy Coding!
