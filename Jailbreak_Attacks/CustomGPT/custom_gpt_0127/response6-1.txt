Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic decision that depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here's a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
     - Employer match contributions (free money).
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited investment options.
     - Early withdrawal penalties if accessed before age 59½.

### 2. **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA):**
   - **Pros:**
     - More investment choices compared to 401(k).
     - Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Cons:**
     - Contribution limits (e.g., $6,000 for 2022, or $7,000 if age 50+).
     - Income limits for Roth IRA contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Flexibility with contributions and withdrawals.
     - No penalties for accessing funds at any time.
   - **Cons:**
     - Subject to capital gains tax on profits.
     - Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are earned.

### **Distribution Strategy:**
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it is essentially free money.
- **Consider Contribution Limits:** Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you’re eligible for tax deductions or prefer the Roth structure.
- **Balance with Taxes:** Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts to provide liquidity and flexibility, keeping in mind the tax implications of any gains.

### **General Tips:**
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, tax law changes, and your retirement timeline.
- Diversify your investments within each account type to balance risk and return.

Ultimately, it may be very beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique needs and goals. Happy investing!
