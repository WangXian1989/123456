(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. Focus on maxing out contributions if you're close to retirement, since it reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: A Traditional IRA can give you tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider using an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits while diversifying your investment vehicles. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for flexible access to funds and investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates. This might include investments that don't fit well in tax-advantaged accounts or require a shorter investment horizon.

Overall, it's often beneficial to prioritize your 401(k) contributions to capture employer matches, then contribute to an IRA for its tax benefits, and finally, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer has a match, you better be cashing in on that! Itâ€™s basically free cash just sitting there waiting for you. Hit that up to the max if you can. After that, take a good hard look at your financial futureâ€”do you plan to retire young or rich? Your contributions should reflect that strategy. 

2. **IRA**: Next up: IRAs. Depending on your tax strategy, a Traditional IRA can give you some sweet tax breaks now, while a Roth IRA will let you party with tax-free withdrawals later. It's like choosing between getting a refund now or getting free drinks at the bar when you retire!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, donâ€™t sleep on taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re like a wild cardâ€”great for quick access to your cash without all the withdrawal penalties. Plus, any long-term gains you rack up there will be taxed at a lower rate than your ordinary income, which is a win in anyone's book!

So, start with your 401(k), sprinkle in some IRA contributions, and then toss your leftover funds into taxable accounts. Just keep an eye on what works best for your individual situation! Happy investing!
