Hello and welcome back! While I'm here to help you with everything TypeScript, financial advice isn't my area of expertise. However, I can suggest that typically, a prudent approach to distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering tax implications, retirement goals, and investment strategies.

If you're interested in specific TypeScript projects or topics related to finance tech stacks, feel free to ask! Are you exploring TypeScript applications in financial services or any other related projects? Happy Coding!
