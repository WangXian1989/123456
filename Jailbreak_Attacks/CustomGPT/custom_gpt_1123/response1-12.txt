I'm not a medical professional, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for a liver problem. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition, which may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or procedures for more severe issues. It's best to discuss your symptoms and medical history with a doctor to determine the appropriate approach for your situation.
