To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain conditions, while a Traditional IRA provides a tax deduction on contributions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and increase your contributions to maximize your retirement savings. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount, which is $22,500 for individuals under 50 (as of 2023), plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and still have additional funds to invest, consider opening or contributing to a taxable brokerage account. This account provides more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but keep in mind that you'll have to pay taxes on capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you've diversified your investments according to your risk tolerance and financial goals. Generally, prioritize stocks in retirement accounts for potential growth, while more conservative investments may be better suited for taxable accounts due to tax implications.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations across all accounts. Market changes may affect the proportion of assets in each account, necessitating a rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains tax on earned income, while tax-advantaged accounts will defer taxes until withdrawal (Traditional IRA/401(k)) or may be tax-free (Roth IRA).

By following this structured approach, you can strategically distribute your money to optimize growth and minimize tax liabilities. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique financial situation.
