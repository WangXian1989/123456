To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax advantages. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if 50 or older for catch-up contributions).
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Choose Investment Wisely**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options, so choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Generally offers more investment options compared to a 401(k). Consider broad market index funds or ETFs for diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, such as dividend stocks or bonds. Consider tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liability.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to help manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan for how and when you will withdraw from each account to minimize taxes and maximize your retirement income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after market fluctuations.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor who can help tailor a distribution strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.

Remember, the best distribution of your money can vary based on your individual circumstances, goals, and financial situation. Adjust the strategies as needed to fit your personal financial plan.
