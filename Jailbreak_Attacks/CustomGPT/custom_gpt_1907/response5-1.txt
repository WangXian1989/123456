(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, the following strategies can be beneficial:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take advantage of any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing you to benefit from tax-free withdrawals.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term or for investments that might generate capital gains, balancing between stocks and bonds for growth versus stability.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: Before anything else, make sure you're maxing out your 401(k), especially if your employer is matching contributions. Itâ€™s free money, so donâ€™t leave that on the table!
   
2. **Flexible Roth IRA**: After that, dive into a Roth IRA. If you think you'll be making more later or want tax-free withdrawals during retirement, itâ€™s a solid move. Just be mindful of income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Fun**: Use your taxable accounts for money you might need sooner or for investments that are going to throw off decent capital gains. Go for a mix of growth and income to keep things spicy.

Remember, everyoneâ€™s situation is unique, so itâ€™s worth chatting with a financial advisor to really nail down your specific strategy!
