Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, investment options, and liquidity. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maxing out the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income).
   - If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for future tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment options in your 401(k). If they are limited or high-cost, consider putting more into your IRA or taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower-taxed income (like qualified dividends).

5. **Maintain Liquidity**:
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs since withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.
