Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s an overview of strategies for each account type:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This is beneficial for high earners.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Great for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts allow for more accessible withdrawals without penalties. Good for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help minimize tax burdens.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Prioritize 401(k) contributions** to at least the match limit.
- **Maximize IRA contributions** next, choosing between traditional or Roth based on your tax outlook.
- **Invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts,** focusing on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### General Allocation Tips:
- Assess your **risk tolerance:** Younger investors might favor a more aggressive allocation, while those nearing retirement might shift towards safer investments.
- **Rebalance regularly** to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.
- Consider **diversifying across asset classes** (stocks, bonds, real estate) to spread risk.
