To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to any employer match, then consider increasing contributions if your budget allows. Prioritize traditional 401(k) for tax deferral, or Roth 401(k) if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Max out IRA contributions if eligible. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect tax rates to rise or your income to increase in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high capital gains, like stocks, or for money you may need before retirement. This account offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes, utilizing accounts strategically based on your tax situation in retirement.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual financial situation and goals.
