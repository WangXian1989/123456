To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. If you can, aim to max out your contributions annually.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher capital gains, as long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate. Hold bonds or high dividend stocks here to manage tax implications efficiently.
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while keeping income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation.

### 4. **Regular Contributions and Adjustments**
   - Continuously contribute a set amount to each account on a regular basis. Adjust contributions based on market conditions and your financial goals.

### 5. **Consider Retirement Timeline**
   - Adjust your contributions based on your retirement timeline. Younger investors can take more risks, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on stability and income.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio across your different accounts.
