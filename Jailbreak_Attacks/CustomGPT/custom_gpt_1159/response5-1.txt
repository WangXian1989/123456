Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of each:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contributions:** Max out employer match contributions if available; it’s free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Consideration:** Choose low-cost investment options within the plan to maximize growth.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for 50+ as of 2023).
   - **Tax Benefits:**
     - Traditional IRA: Tax-deductible contributions; taxes due upon withdrawal.
     - Roth IRA: Contributions are post-tax; withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.
   - **Strategy:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for long-term tax benefits, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** No contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, providing flexibility for access to funds.
   - **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year for lower tax rates.
   - **Investment Strategy:** Use for short- to mid-term goals or to diversify beyond retirement accounts.

### **General Strategy:**
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to capture matching contributions.
- Next, fund an IRA for the additional tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for liquidity or to achieve investment goals not tied to retirement.

### **Example Allocation:**
- 401(k): Max out contributions, especially to take advantage of employer match.
- IRA: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, favoring Roth if tax situation allows.
- Taxable: Invest remaining funds focusing on long-term growth, while being mindful of tax impacts.
