Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that free money first.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Contribute up to the limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for any extra funds after maximizing retirement accounts. They offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before investing heavily.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) to manage risk.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Consider your retirement age and lifestyle goals when deciding how to allocate funds. Adjust based on how close you are to retirement.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation and goals change.
