To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After maximizing the match, focus on traditional or Roth IRAs. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Keep high-turnover investments or those with high taxable income in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments within each account type to spread risk and enhance potential returns, considering both stocks and bonds.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

By balancing contributions according to these guidelines, you can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential for your overall investment strategy.
