When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. Max out contributions to these accounts as they provide tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate tax-efficient income, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability.

2. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your investment allocations accordingly across all accounts. Avoid high-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts if youâ€™re nearing retirement.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your investment goals (short-term vs. long-term) and allocate funds accordingly. Use the 401(k) and IRA primarily for retirement and the taxable account for goals within a 5-10 year horizon.

4. **Fees and Expenses**:
   - Keep an eye on fees associated with each account. Low-cost options are preferable, especially in taxable accounts to maximize returns.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA to optimize tax benefits.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
