Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match firstâ€”it's essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for short-term goals or as a source of tax-efficient income through capital gains and qualified dividends.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk.

4. **Set Priorities**: 
   - Focus on retirement accounts first, then use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**: 
   - If you prioritize retirement, allocate more to 401(k) and IRA. For shorter-term needs, lean toward taxable accounts.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
