When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match (if available).
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as they offer tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - If you anticipate a lower tax bracket, taxable accounts and Roth IRAs might be beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Place more stable, income-generating investments (bonds, dividends) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

4. **Keep an Eye on Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Ensure your allocation allows for easy access to funds without penalties, if needed, by maintaining a balance in taxable accounts.

Regularly reassess your allocations based on your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
