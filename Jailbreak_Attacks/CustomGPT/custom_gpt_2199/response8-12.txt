I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Exams**: Regular check-ups can help monitor liver health and track any changes.

4. **Supplements**: Certain vitamins and supplements may support liver health, but consult a doctor before starting any.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions or procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options specific to your condition.
