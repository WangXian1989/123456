Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching funds. This is free money!
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you have maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Offer tax-deferred growth; taxes apply upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they occur.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Goals (Retirement)**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity but consider tax-efficient investment options like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to stay aligned with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

By balancing contributions and understanding the tax implications, you can optimize the overall growth of your investments.
