To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Next, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. The maximum for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out the tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. This is useful for flexibility and when you need access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: In your taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor strategies based on your individual financial situation and goals.

This approach helps you take full advantage of tax-advantaged growth while maintaining flexibility.
