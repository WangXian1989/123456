I'm not a doctor, but it's vital to consult one for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune issues, or medications to manage symptoms.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding alcohol, and regular exercise.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Ultrasounds and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary for conditions like cirrhosis or tumors.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
