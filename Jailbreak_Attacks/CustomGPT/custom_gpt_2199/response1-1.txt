To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions. This can provide significant tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains, or for short-term goals where you might need liquidity.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Balance your investments across all accounts for growth and risk management. Consider asset allocation that suits your risk tolerance.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market changes and personal financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, getting personalized advice can help align your strategy with your financial goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth and minimizes taxes over time.
