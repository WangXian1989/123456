The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

4. **Balance Your Investments**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and consider fixed-income investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

5. **Reevaluate and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your life circumstances, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
