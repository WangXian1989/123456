The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your income, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Best for those in higher tax brackets.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold investments that generate high dividends or interest (which are taxable) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have adequate savings in liquid assets before committing excess cash to retirement accounts. 

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment choices within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changing performance and your financial goals.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.
