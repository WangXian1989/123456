The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially “free money”.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Prioritize Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA): Withdrawals are taxed as income during retirement. These accounts are great for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, making it beneficial for long-term tax planning.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; these are taxed in the year gains are realized.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to minimize risk. Each account can hold stocks, bonds, and other assets, but the allocation might differ based on your goals.

4. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Before allocating heavily into these accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Long-Term Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Adjust your contributions based on your expected retirement age and other financial goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep an eye on your allocations and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
