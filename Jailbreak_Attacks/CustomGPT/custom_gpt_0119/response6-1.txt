Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may lower your taxable income now, and Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you'll need before retirement, as they offer flexibility and easier access to funds.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

4. **Review Regularly**: Adapt your strategy as your income, goals, and tax laws change.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your approach to your specific situation for optimal results.
