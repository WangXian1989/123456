I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems that you might want to discuss with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) and regular exercise can improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the type of liver problem (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), there may be specific medications available to help treat the condition.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health, especially in cases of liver disease.

4. **Weight Management**: If overweight, losing weight can help reduce fat in the liver.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine liver function tests can help track the progress of your liver health.

6. **Liver Supplements**: Some people take supplements like milk thistle, though you should consult a doctor before starting any new supplement.

7. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver failure, a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
