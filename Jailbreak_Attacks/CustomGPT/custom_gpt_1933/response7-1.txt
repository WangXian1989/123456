Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions:** After securing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) as they often have favorable tax advantages. A Roth IRA, in particular, offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k):** Once you’ve maximized your IRA, return to your 401(k) to contribute up to the annual limit. This can provide you with higher contribution limits compared to an IRA.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, although they do not have the same tax advantages.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** Be mindful of how your income and tax bracket affect your contributions. For example, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider focusing more on Roth options.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This can help manage risk and enhance returns.

7. **Review Regularly:** Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on life changes, investment performance, and changes in financial goals.

By following this strategy, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to help achieve your financial objectives. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
