Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating additional funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, so they’re often best for investments that you plan to hold long-term.

3. **Investment Goals**: Consider your investment time horizon:
   - Long-term goals (retirement): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
   - Short-term goals (buying a house, emergency fund): Utilize taxable accounts for easy access to funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50+ in 2024).
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50+ in 2024).
   - No limits on taxable accounts, but consider the implications on your tax liability.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow further.

7. **Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

By assessing your goals and considering these factors, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your investments.
