Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've funded your IRA, increase your contributions to the 401(k) to reach the annual limit, especially if your 401(k) offers low-cost investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maxed out your retirement accounts. They can be useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and choose tax-efficient investments for your taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes and sectors to manage risk.

It’s always wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual situation.
