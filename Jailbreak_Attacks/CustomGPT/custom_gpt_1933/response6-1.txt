Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a concise approach to effectively allocate your funds:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, depending on your current tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Tax-Efficiency:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for immediate needs, which can be managed through taxable accounts.

### **Allocation Strategy:**
- **Short-Term Goals:** Fund taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Medium- to Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for their growth potential and tax benefits.

### **Investment Considerations:**
- Diversify across asset classes to spread risk while aiming for a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

By balancing contributions according to these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy and enhance long-term growth.
