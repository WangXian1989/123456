The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: These accounts are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on contributions or earnings until you withdraw in retirement. If you have a high tax rate now, it may make sense to max out contributions here.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   
3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you are in a lower tax bracket now, Roth contributions (either in an IRA or a 401(k)) might be more advantageous. If you’re in a higher bracket, traditional tax-deferred accounts may save you more on taxes in the short term.

4. **Diversify and Balance**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors within each account to reduce risk.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Shorter-Term Goals**: If you plan to access your investments before retirement (e.g., buying a house), consider using a taxable account. This will give you more flexibility without penalties.

6. **Plan for Taxes on Withdrawals**: Remember that withdrawals from traditional accounts will be taxed as income. A strategy could be to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to keep your tax bracket lower for as long as possible.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, market conditions, and your financial goals.

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
