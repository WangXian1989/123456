To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money before allocating funds to other accounts.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), depending on your plan. Traditional contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth contributions provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim to maximize your contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, which may be beneficial if you need to lower your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts should be used for investments that generate tax-efficient gains. This could include capital gains from stocks you've held long-term or tax-efficient ETFs. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals, as you can strategically withdraw with tax implications in mind.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance:
   - Higher-risk investments (like stocks) may be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Lower-risk investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens from interest income.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation and the performance of your investments periodically, adjusting contributions as needed to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Depending on your age and when you plan to retire, your allocation strategy may differ. Younger investors may opt for a higher percentage in equities while older investors may prefer safer investments.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Given that individual circumstances vary greatly, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice that aligns with your specific financial goals and situation.

Itâ€™s essential to plan based on your long-term financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.
