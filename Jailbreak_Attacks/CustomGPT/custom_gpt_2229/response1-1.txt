To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before allocating excess funds to retirement accounts, consider paying off high-interest debt, as the interest can negate investment returns.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and retirement goals). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This can include stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes to manage risk effectively. This can include a mix of equities, fixed income, and alternative investments.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments may need to be. Younger investors can typically afford more risk.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial goals and situation.

Remember that everyone's circumstances are different, so tailor this strategy to fit your unique financial situation and long-term goals.
