To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the IRS limit, focusing on pre-tax contributions for immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Consider both Traditional and Roth IRAs. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Choose a diversified mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable income. Consider holding tax-efficient ETFs or index funds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to ensure you stay aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts based on your needs.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
