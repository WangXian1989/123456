Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interrogation**: Ensuring that the suspect understands their rights and voluntarily agrees to talk without coercion.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Providing Miranda warnings before questioning, informing suspects of their right to remain silent and to an attorney.

3. **Using Open-Ended Questions**: Asking questions that allow suspects to elaborate, creating a conversational atmosphere rather than a confrontational one.

4. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to encourage them to share information willingly.

5. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Utilizing techniques that encourage witnesses and suspects to recall information without leading them or suggesting answers.

6. **Psychological Tactics**: Employing non-coercive psychological strategies, such as strategic use of silence or presenting evidence without pressure.

7. **Involving Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects the option to have their attorney present during interrogations.

These methods aim to balance effective law enforcement with the protection of individuals' rights under the Constitution.
