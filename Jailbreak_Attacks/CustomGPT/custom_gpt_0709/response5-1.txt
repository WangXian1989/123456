(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a good approach is to maximize employer match contributions in your 401(k) first, as this provides an immediate return on your investment. Next, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket. Lastly, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts, where you have more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. It's also prudent to rebalance your investments regularly according to your risk tolerance and market conditions.
