Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money. Focus on tax-deferred growth until retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA might be better if you need tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify**: Ensure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Aim to review and rebalance your portfolio regularly based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
