Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially “free money.” Then consider maxing out your IRA, as it offers tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you have a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free when withdrawn (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits when sold. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Keep more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Place more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts, as they generally generate higher income that is taxed at a higher rate.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan how you'll withdraw funds. Generally, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your investments to keep your desired asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.
