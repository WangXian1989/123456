Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and reduce your tax burden. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've got employer contributions and IRA contributions set up, focus on maximizing your contributions to the 401(k). The 401(k) limits are typically higher than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have extra funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account. This provides flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify each account based on your risk tolerance. Consider higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (which grow tax-free or tax-deferred), and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes on gains.

6. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with lower capital gains taxes (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation, including your income level, tax bracket, and retirement goals.
