Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation. IRAs typically offer more investment options and potential tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, invest in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for both short-term and long-term goals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across these accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds), and keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, whereas Roth IRA withdrawals may be tax-free in retirement. Taxable accounts can offer capital gains rates, which are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on your changing financial needs, market conditions, and retirement timelines.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
