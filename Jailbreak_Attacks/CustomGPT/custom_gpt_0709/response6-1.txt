To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax advantages; contributions are typically pre-tax. Focus on maximizing employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax. Useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: After your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexible access.

### 3. **Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for immediate financial goals.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place investments with high expected returns or frequent trading in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Keep investments generating qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjust**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals, rebalancing as necessary.

By prioritizing contributions and focusing on tax efficiency, you can optimize the distribution of your funds across these accounts to support your financial objectives.
