When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a balanced approach that considers your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline is essential. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer match contributions, which is essentially "free money." Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth (in the case of a Roth IRA). You can choose between Traditional or Roth IRAs based on your current tax bracket and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax. They offer more flexibility since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, ensure that you contribute enough to maximize this benefit, as it provides a guaranteed return on your investment.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals are tax-free.
   - For those who anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) can be more beneficial due to tax deferral.

4. **Diversify Contributions**: 
   - A common strategy is to allocate a percentage of your savings to each account type. For example, you might contribute 50% to your 401(k), 30% to your IRA, and 20% to taxable accounts.
   - This helps spread out tax liabilities and provides liquidity for unexpected needs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your financial situation or market conditions change, itâ€™s important to review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired balance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor your distribution strategy based on your unique circumstances, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

It's essential to create a plan that aligns with your overall financial strategy while considering current and future tax implications.
