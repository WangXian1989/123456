Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax considerations. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Asset Location**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Make sure your overall investment mix aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversifying across accounts helps manage risk while optimizing growth.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Consider your unique situation, and if necessary, consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your needs and goals.
