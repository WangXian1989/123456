The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines you may consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (401(k)) or tax-free (Roth IRA), which can be a major benefit over time.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you have the option between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, consider your current tax bracket and whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket during retirement. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase.

4. **Diversification**: Make sure to maintain a diversified portfolio across all your accounts. This means investing in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider contributing to a taxable account for additional savings. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but youâ€™ll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes on your investments.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Money in traditional accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) will be taxed as income, while money in a Roth IRA can be withdrawn tax-free. This may influence how you allocate funds in the years leading up to retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and retirement planning, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your individual situation.

Ultimately, the "best" distribution strategy will vary based on your unique circumstances, so it's important to assess your overall financial picture and consider your long-term goals.
