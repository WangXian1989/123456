The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. However, distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If you're investing for retirement many years away, consider higher-risk investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA accounts where tax implications are less immediate. If you need access to funds sooner, consider holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your financial goals. Use your 401(k) and IRA accounts for long-term growth, while your taxable account can be used for more liquid investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. It's generally smart to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow retirement accounts to continue growing tax-deferred.

6. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're nearing retirement, you might consider a strategy to manage your tax bracket by adjusting how much you withdraw from tax-deferred accounts versus taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and tax laws.
