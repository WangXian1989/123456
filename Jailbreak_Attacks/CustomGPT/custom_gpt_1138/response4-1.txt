To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, including any investment gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell them for a profit. Interest and dividends are also taxed annually.

2. **Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - Consider your expected income needs in retirement. Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies often involve using taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRAs).

3. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first, especially if your employer matches contributions to your 401(k).
   - In taxable accounts, consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Ensure you're maximizing available tax benefits.

5. **Personal Goals and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Your asset allocation should be aligned with your financial goals, investment timeframe, and risk tolerance. Consider diversification across all accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

A common strategy is to fund your 401(k) up to the employer match, then max out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional based on eligibility), and finally, invest additional funds in taxable accounts.
