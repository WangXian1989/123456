Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)s). Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Flexibility in withdrawals and no contribution limits.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of the match as it's essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Consider placing income-generating investments (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Emergency Funds**: Make sure you have an accessible emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Tax Planning**: Consider your current and projected future tax rates. It may be beneficial to do Roth conversions or balance withdrawals strategically during retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your net worth, income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.

8. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and market conditions may change over time, so it's important to review and adjust your allocations as needed.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers the tax implications, the growth potential of investments, and your personal financial goals will help you distribute your money wisely among your accounts.
