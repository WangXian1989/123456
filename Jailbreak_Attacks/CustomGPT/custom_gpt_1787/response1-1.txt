The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After getting the match, consider contributing more to a 401(k), especially if it's a traditional 401(k) which offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can then consider investing in taxable accounts. These are good for flexibility and liquidity since you can access your money without penalties.

4. **Diversity of Investments**: Ensure that within each account, you’re diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Depending on whether you're in a higher or lower tax bracket now vs. expected in retirement, you might prioritize contributions to traditional or Roth accounts accordingly.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy best suited to your specific circumstances and goals.
