(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement planning needs. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Typically, you might want to prioritize your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can take advantage of tax deductions. Any additional savings can then be directed towards taxable accounts, which provide flexibility but may not offer the same tax benefits. Itâ€™s also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.

Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth, youâ€™ll want to consider the tax implications. After you've taken care of those, throw whatever youâ€™ve got left into taxable accounts. They give you mad flexibility and access without penalties. Just keep in mind you'll face taxes on earnings, so itâ€™s a balance!
