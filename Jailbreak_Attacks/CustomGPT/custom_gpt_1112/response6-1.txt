When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. Assess Your Contributions
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax-advantaged growth.

### 2. Diversify Investments
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., mutual funds, index funds). Consider including a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk profile.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, you can select similar investments as in your 401(k), but you might have more diverse options, including individual stocks.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using these for more liquid investments or higher-risk options. Keep in mind capital gains taxes; prioritize investments that generate qualified dividends over ordinary income.

### 3. Tax Efficiency
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use these for assets expected to grow significantly (e.g., growth stocks, REITs) to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that are tax-efficient (e.g., ETFs, municipal bonds) to minimize tax liability.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on market performance, life changes, and tax law adjustments.
   - Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your target asset allocation.

This structured approach helps optimize your investments while considering tax implications and financial growth objectives.
