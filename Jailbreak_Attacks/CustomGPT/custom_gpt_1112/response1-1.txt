To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize this up to the match limit.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. This gives you liquidity, but be aware of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, growth-oriented assets (like stocks) can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while income-generating assets (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts due to their tax treatment.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and life changes.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
