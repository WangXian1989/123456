Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility but less tax efficiency.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals later. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Hold more stable investments or those generating frequent income (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax efficiently.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Goals:**
   - For long-term growth, prioritize maxing out your retirement accounts.
   - For short-term needs or flexibility, maintain sufficient funds in your taxable account.

### 5. **Adjust as Needed:**
   - Review your contributions and investment performance regularly, especially as your income, financial goals, or tax situation changes.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach typically involves maximizing employer matches, fully funding tax-advantaged accounts, and using taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide customized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
