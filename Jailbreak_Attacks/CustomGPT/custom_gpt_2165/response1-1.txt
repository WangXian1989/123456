The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while for IRAs, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each of these accounts, diversify your investments to spread risk. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are typically tax-deductible, while contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement to determine which account types may be more beneficial.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have investment goals that require access to funds before retirement (like buying a home), consider using taxable accounts, as they provide more liquidity without penalties.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: As your situation changes (e.g., income fluctuations, changes in tax laws, or shifts in your investment goals), itâ€™s wise to reassess how you distribute your contributions across these accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you develop a comprehensive investment strategy. 

Ultimately, striking the right balance will depend on your individual circumstances and risk tolerance.
