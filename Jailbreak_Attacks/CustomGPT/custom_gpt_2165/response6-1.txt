When considering the distribution of your money among different investment accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to analyze the characteristics of each account type. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversify Account Types**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility. Investing in index funds or ETFs can be tax-efficient due to lower capital gains distributions.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a high tax bracket now, lean towards maxing out tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous for long-term growth.

4. **Continually Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your targeted risk level.
   - Be mindful of changes in tax laws that may affect your strategy.

By applying these strategies, you can maximize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time. Consider speaking to a financial advisor to tailor a specific plan based on your individual financial situation.
