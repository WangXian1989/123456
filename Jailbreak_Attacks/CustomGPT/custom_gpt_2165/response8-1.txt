The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions can be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will also be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. This can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on any capital gains, interest, and dividends in the year they're realized. Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for more favorable tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in all your accounts to manage risk effectively. 

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you might withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s, $6,500 for IRAs, and there may be additional catch-up contributions if you're over a certain age.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**: Regularly review your financial situation and adjust your contributions as needed based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice to tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs and situation.

By implementing these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
