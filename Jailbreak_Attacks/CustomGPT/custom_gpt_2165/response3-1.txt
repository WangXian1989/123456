When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the specific characteristics of each type of account. Here’s a guide to help you decide the best way to allocate your resources:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a retirement account offered by employers, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, meaning they reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This account comes in two main types: Traditional and Roth. Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible upon contribution, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are not tax-advantaged. You will pay taxes on any investment income and capital gains in the year they are realized.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency. Often, it's best to contribute up to the match in your 401(k) before fully funding your IRA.

4. **Fund Retirement Accounts Prior to Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you have maxed the employer match in your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions. In 2023, the contribution limit for both IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 and older).
   - After these contributions, you may return to your 401(k) to maximize your contributions (limit is $22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 for those 50+).

5. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**:
   - The type of investments is also important. Generally, it's advisable to place bonds and less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) since those accounts defer or eliminate taxes. Conversely, more aggressive, tax-efficient investments (like stock index funds) can be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Evaluate Current and Future Tax Brackets**:
   - Think about your current tax situation versus expected future income. If you believe you’ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, maxing contributions to Roth accounts might be prudent.

7. **Adjust as Necessary**:
   - Regularly review your allocation as your income, financial situation, and tax laws change. Rebalancing may be necessary to refine your investment mix and account contributions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure or have a complicated financial situation, a financial advisor can offer personalized guidance tailored to your individual circumstances.

By prioritizing contributions to account types that best align with your financial objectives and tax implications, you can create a well-structured allocation across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
