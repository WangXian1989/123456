Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contributions to a 401(k) are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), so consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding which type to invest in.
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you are in your high-earning years.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Consider opening a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you are eligible, try to contribute the maximum each year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use a taxable account for money that you might need to access before retirement. This includes funds for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; favor long-term investments that have the potential to grow for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - Tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, can help minimize tax liabilities.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Start with maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match.
- Next, consider maxing out an IRA if you are eligible.
- Finally, allocate any additional savings to a taxable account as needed for liquidity and short-term goals.

It's essential to periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial needs. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
