When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to take into account several factors such as your current financial situation, your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here are some general guidelines that might help you in your decision-making process:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), it's advisable to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for younger savers or those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages but allow for more flexible access to funds.

4. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options available within your 401(k) compared to those in your IRA and taxable accounts. Depending on the fees and performance of these funds, it might be better to invest more in one type of account over another.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you anticipate needing funds before retirement age without penalties, keep some money in taxable accounts for more immediate access. This can be particularly important for short-term goals or emergencies.

6. **Long-term Growth**: If you can afford to leave your investments for the long term, prioritize accounts that offer tax advantages for retirement. 

7. **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger individuals may weight their portfolio towards more aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement might focus on more conservative options.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute to your accounts and as market conditions change, periodically reassess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

Since individual circumstances can vary significantly, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
