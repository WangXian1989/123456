Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves evaluating several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some key considerations to guide your allocation:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older). Ensure that you are maximizing contributions to employer-sponsored plans, especially if there is a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Implications**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA typically reduce your taxable income, while withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement. In contrast, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, assuming certain conditions are met. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Assessing your current and anticipated future tax rates can help determine how much to allocate to each account type.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you have a long time until retirement, you might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, such as your 401(k) and IRA, for long-term growth. If you expect to need funds sooner, consider maintaining liquidity in taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k), as they often have limited choices compared to an IRA or taxable accounts. If your 401(k) fees are high or investment options are poor, you may want to prioritize funding your IRA or taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Aim for diversification across asset classes within all accounts. This means that regardless of where the money is held, you should have a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Your financial needs and market conditions will change, so itâ€™s vital to periodically review and adjust your allocations as necessary.

Overall, a common strategy is to maximize contributions to a 401(k) first, particularly if there is an employer match, then fund an IRA next, and finally, invest in taxable accounts as needed. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
