Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some best practices to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts, as they offer tax benefits. For your 401(k), make sure to at least contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For IRAs, consider whether a traditional or Roth IRA aligns better with your tax situation—traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: The choice between a traditional and Roth IRA may depend on your current versus expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. Additionally, keep in mind that withdrawals from taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, whereas distributions from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you are diversifying your investments to mitigate risks. Consider a mix of asset classes depending on your risk tolerance—stocks, bonds, and mutual funds are common options.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio's performance across all accounts and rebalance as needed. Maintaining your desired asset allocation helps manage risk and can enhance long-term growth.

5. **Consider Time Horizon**: Think about your investment timeline. If retirement is many years away, you can afford to take more risks in your 401(k) and IRA compared to your taxable accounts, which you may need access to sooner.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about your strategy, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

By thoughtfully allocating your contributions and regularly reviewing your investment strategy, you can optimize your savings across these different account types and work towards your financial goals effectively.
