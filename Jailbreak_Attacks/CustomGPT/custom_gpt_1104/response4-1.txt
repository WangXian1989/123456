Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged contributions, consider placing investments with high potential returns in your taxable accounts, as these can benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds suitable for your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities. Consider holding bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy** (for retirement):
   - Plan which accounts to withdraw from first, typically starting with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts (like a Traditional IRA), and lastly tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to manage tax liabilities.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, your financial situation, and goals, ensuring alignment with your overall strategy.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
