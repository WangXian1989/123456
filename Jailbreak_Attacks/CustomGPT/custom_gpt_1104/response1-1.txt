Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you want tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for short-term goals and offer more flexibility. Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, but you have more control over when you realize those gains.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Place high-growth, more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) to maximize tax-efficient growth.
   - Conversely, consider holding more stable investments or those yielding dividends in taxable accounts for better tax treatment.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio remains diversified across all account types to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocations based on your performance, life changes, and market conditions.

6. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your retirement timeline and financial goals. The further you are from retirement, the more risk you can typically afford to take on.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
