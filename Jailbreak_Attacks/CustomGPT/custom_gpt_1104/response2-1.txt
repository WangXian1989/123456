Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and a great way to start.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you have higher income and want to reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for liquidity and flexibility, especially if you plan to access funds before retirement.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Keep in mind the types of investments you hold in each account. For example, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments (such as bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide a personalized plan tailored to your unique situation.
