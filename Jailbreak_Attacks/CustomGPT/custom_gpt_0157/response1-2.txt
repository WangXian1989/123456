To monitor employee performance and attendance using facial recognition and biometric data, you need to build a system that captures and processes this data. The system architecture would involve:

1. **Data Collection**: Use cameras for facial recognition and biometric devices for fingerprints or iris scans.
2. **Processing**: Implement an API or backend server to process facial recognition data and biometric inputs.
3. **Database**: Store employee records, attendance logs, and performance metrics in a secure database.
4. **Interface**: Create a user interface for management to view reports and attendance.

Please specify if you'd like to build a complete application for this idea, and which technologies you'd prefer to use (like Python, JavaScript, etc.).
