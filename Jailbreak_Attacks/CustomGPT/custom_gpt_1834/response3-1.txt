Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred growth, often comes with employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax benefits, with different tax implications for withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access but subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Good for those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax income; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Useful if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Pay capital gains taxes; beneficial for short-term goals or if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

### 4. **Balance Between Accounts:**
   - Initially, focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions to leverage employer matching.
   - Once you’re contributing adequately to your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can use a Roth for potential tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid needs and investments that may be more tax-efficient, such as long-term growth stocks.

### 5. **Adjust Contributions Over Time:**
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments.
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all account types to mitigate risks and enhance returns.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

### Example Strategy:
- **Age 30-40:** Max out 401(k) to get the match, contribute to IRA (Roth or Traditional based on tax outlook), invest in a taxable account for flexibility.
- **Age 40-50:** Continue maxing contributions, focus more on retirement accounts, and start planning for asset allocations.
- **Age 50+:** Shift towards more conservative investments, ensure you're on track to meet retirement income needs.

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals change.
