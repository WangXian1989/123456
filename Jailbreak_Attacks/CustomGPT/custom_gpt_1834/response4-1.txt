Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are usually tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on this money until withdrawal in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Good for long-term growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell assets. Consider using these accounts for short-term goals or investments that produce dividends or interest, which are taxed annually.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts, considering each account’s tax implications.
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) may be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, it’s wise to draw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Adjust for Goals**:
   - Your age, retirement timeline, and specific financial goals should guide your distribution strategy. Younger investors might favor aggressive growth in taxable accounts, while those nearing retirement might shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and changing market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your specific situation.
