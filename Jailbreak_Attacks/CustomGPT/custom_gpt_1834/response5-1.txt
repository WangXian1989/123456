Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals; otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide current tax deductions.
   
2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient index funds.
   - Hold high-tax investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate stocks and other growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in your taxable accounts if they produce regular income to balance tax treatments.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then traditional IRA/401(k), and save Roth IRA withdrawals for last due to their tax-free nature.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities of personal finance, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific situation.

### Example of a Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get employer match, then aim for 10-15% of your income.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed, focusing on a Roth if you qualify.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings in low-fee index funds or ETFs.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so it's essential to tailor your approach accordingly.
