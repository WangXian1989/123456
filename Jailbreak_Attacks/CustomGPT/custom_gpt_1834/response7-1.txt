To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and a good starting point.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match and consider maxing it out if you can. The tax deferral can help your investments grow significantly.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA after your 401(k) contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investing**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher short-term capital gains or interest income, such as bonds or actively managed shares, as these can be taxed at your ordinary income rate. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Typically, equities should be favored for long-term growth, while bonds may offer stability.

5. **Rebalance**: Over time, you may need to rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Draw Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs).

Consult with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
