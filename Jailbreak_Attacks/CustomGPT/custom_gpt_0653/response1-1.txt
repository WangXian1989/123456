When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your overall financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider tax advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which means you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, and you'll pay taxes when you withdraw. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it attractive if you believe your tax rate will increase in the future.
  
3. **Balance between tax-deferred and taxable accounts**: 
   - Fund your tax-advantaged accounts first, as they lower your taxable income and can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate capital gains or income that could be taxed at a lower rate, such as qualified dividends.

4. **Diversify your investments**: Ensure that your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Consider your time horizon**: If you’re several years away from retirement, you might favor growth-oriented investments. As you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative options to preserve capital.

6. **Stay flexible**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on performance, changing goals, and tax laws.

Remember, it’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that best fits your financial situation.
