(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. After reaching the employer match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Finally, any additional funds can go into taxable accounts for more flexibility. Additionally, it's wise to maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts aligned with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
