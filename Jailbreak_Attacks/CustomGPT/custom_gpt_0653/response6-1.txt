To effectively allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially “free money” that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Diversity of Tax Treatment**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k). Consider using this if you wish to lower your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize this account.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility. Consider these for short-term savings and investments that can be accessed without penalties.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Choose investments based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. For retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider growth-oriented investments like stocks due to the long-term nature of these accounts.
   - For taxable accounts, leaning towards low-turnover investments (like index funds) can help reduce capital gains taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan your withdrawals based on your tax situation in retirement. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts, to manage your tax brackets strategically.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure you’re sticking to your investment strategy and that your risk level remains appropriate for your age and financial goals.

Overall, always consider your personal financial situation, long-term goals, and consult a financial advisor for tailored advice specific to your scenario.
