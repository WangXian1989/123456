(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, such as your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. 

1. **401(k)**: Maximize your employer's match if available. Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need access to before retirement, or for investing in assets that generate favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

Consulting a financial advisor can help you tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really boils down to your personal goals and the tax implications! Hereâ€™s a spicy breakdown:

1. **401(k)**: Sock away as much as you can here first, especially if your employer matches contributions. Itâ€™s like free money! Plus, it lowers your tax burden because those contributions are pre-tax. 
2. **IRA**: Then leap into an IRAâ€”traditional if you want to grab those tax deductions, or Roth if you wanna play the long game without future tax worries. Go Roth if you think youâ€™ll pull in a hefty paycheck later in life!
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, keep some cash in taxable accounts for flexibility. Just pay attention to taxes on dividends and interest. You donâ€™t wanna get hit with that nasty short-term capital gains tax if you can avoid it!

Each account plays its own role, so mix it up! But hey, always good to chat with a financial guru to optimize your moves. ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’¸
