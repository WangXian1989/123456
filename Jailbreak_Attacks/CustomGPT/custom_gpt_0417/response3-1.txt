To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which means you won't pay taxes on this money until you withdraw it in retirement. This account is great for tax-deferral.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell them. Interest and dividends are also taxed in the year they are received.

2. **Assess Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - Younger investors might focus on Roth IRAs to benefit from tax-free growth and withdrawals later.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accountsâ€”this is essentially free money.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to manage risk and improve returns.

5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your short-term needs. Use taxable accounts for money you may need sooner, as 401(k) and IRA funds have penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and prioritize accordingly.

7. **Investment Choices**:
   - Select investments based on the account type. For example, consider placing bonds in taxable accounts (due to lower tax rates on long-term capital gains) and stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.

8. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary to ensure that your investments align with your financial goals.

By adopting a well-rounded approach that considers tax implications, employer matches, your retirement timeline, and your liquidity needs, you can make informed decisions about how to allocate your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
