To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which means you wonâ€™t pay income tax on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Consider maximizing contributions, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA Benefits**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax bracket, you may prefer one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts may incur capital gains tax when sold, so consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for tax efficiency.

### 2. **Determine Your Financial Goals**:
   - **Retirement Horizon**: If you're far from retirement, lean towards more aggressive investments in taxable accounts, as taxes will impact long-term gains less.
   - **Diversification Needs**: Spread your investments across different asset classes and accounts to minimize risk. A combination of stocks, bonds, and real estate might be appropriate.

### 3. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - **Adjust Allocations**: Periodically review your asset allocation based on market performance and your evolving financial goals.
   - **Reinvest Dividends**: Whenever possible, reinvest dividends and interest to take advantage of compound growth in both taxable and tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
It's crucial to tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice. Allocating money among accounts strategically can significantly enhance your long-term financial health.
