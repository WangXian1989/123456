(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are a few general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the maximum match first as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). IRAs tend to offer a wider range of investment options.

3. **Continue with the 401(k)**: If youâ€™re still able to contribute after funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This might be beneficial for short-term needs or specific investment strategies.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts in the future. Generally, taxable accounts can be more flexible for withdrawals since they don't have penalties like retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across these accounts to minimize risk and align with your overall investment strategy.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan best suited for your individual circumstances.
