To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full match. If you can afford to, maximize contributions after that.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide initial tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows for more flexibility in withdrawals and managing capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your goals and risk tolerance. Generally, keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and contributions annually, adjusting as needed based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
