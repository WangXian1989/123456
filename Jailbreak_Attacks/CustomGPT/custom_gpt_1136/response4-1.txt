Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general tips:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Max out contributions if possible, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket, since contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may generate a higher tax burden, such as stocks held for shorter periods. This allows you to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider asset allocation strategies that work well in tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable ones.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your personal situation, especially for tax-efficiency.

Balancing contributions based on immediate needs, future growth potential, and tax implications is key.
