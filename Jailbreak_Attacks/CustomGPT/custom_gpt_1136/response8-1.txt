Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as you pay tax on gains only when you sell.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Investments in 401(k) and IRAs grow tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth).

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement (taking from taxable first, then tax-deferred accounts to manage tax consequences).

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in taxable and retirement accounts, while those nearing retirement may shift to conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your specific situation.

Reviewing your strategy regularly is key to staying on track with your financial goals.
