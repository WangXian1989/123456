Investing your money wisely across different accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s an overview of how to approach this distribution:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically has higher contribution limits and may offer employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Offers tax advantages but has different rules for contributions and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No restrictions on withdrawals, but you'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions, taking advantage of tax benefits and employer matches.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Maintain an adequate amount in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Taxable accounts should focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or avoid taxes on gains.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all account types to manage risk.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out 401(k) contributions with employer match first.**
2. **Contribute to an IRA (Roth if you qualify, for tax-free growth).**
3. **Invest in taxable accounts with surplus funds, prioritizing investments that are tax-efficient.**

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your distribution based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your specific situation, ensuring you’re optimizing tax benefits and aligning with your long-term financial goals.
