To distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s free money!
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Tax Impact**:
   - Put higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce income (like bonds) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering market performance and personal circumstances.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re close to retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Always keep an eye on fees and expenses associated with your investment choices.
