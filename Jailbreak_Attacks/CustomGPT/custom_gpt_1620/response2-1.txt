To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Each Account's Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, with taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts do not have tax advantages. You'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, and dividends are also taxable.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After capturing the match, focus on maxing out IRA contributions ($6,500 for individuals, or $7,500 if age 50 or older for 2023).
   - If eligible, consider the Roth IRA, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Consider High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), consider paying that off before maxing out contributions.

5. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable to your 401(k) ($22,500 for individuals, or $30,000 if age 50 or older for 2023) after addressing debt and emergency savings.

6. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

7. **Asset Location Strategy**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while placing bonds and REITs (which generate income) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

8. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies and to ensure your approach fits your retirement plans, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By strategically allocating your finances across these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency.
