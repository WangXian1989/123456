Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guide to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account. Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth and withdrawals). Contribution limits apply and may vary based on income and filing status.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts without tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in the year they’re realized.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings to maximize growth potential and tax benefits.
   - Utilize Roth accounts if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing you to withdraw tax-free.

### 3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out 401(k) and IRA contributions if possible. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 for individuals 50+). The IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50+).

### 4. **Balance Investment Goals:**
   - If your focus is long-term growth, lean towards tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, utilize taxable accounts for more liquidity.
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

### 5. **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Needs:**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before allocating significant funds to any investment accounts.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Reassess your allocation annually or as your financial situation changes. Adjust contributions based on market conditions, investment performance, and changes in income or expenses.

### General Distribution Example:
- **Max out your 401(k) contributions** (if available) for employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (traditional or Roth) based on your income level and tax situation.
- **Invest in taxable accounts** after you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on growth investments if time allows.

### Conclusion:
There isn't a one-size-fits-all strategy – tailoring your plan to your circumstances is crucial. You may benefit from consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
