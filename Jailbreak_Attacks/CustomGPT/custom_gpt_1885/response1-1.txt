Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match first—it’s free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth), depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and continue contributing to the maximum limit, especially if your employer matches.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can provide flexibility since there's no contribution limit and you can withdraw any time. However, taxes on dividends and capital gains can cut into your returns, so consider using these for short-term savings goals or if you anticipate needing liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Across all accounts, ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks might be more appropriate for longer-term accounts, while bonds or cash could be better for funds you might need sooner.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor may also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
