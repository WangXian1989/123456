To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or after-tax, influencing your future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have tax advantages, but you can control capital gains and dividends through your investment choices.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and potential returns.

4. **Investment Horizon**:
   - Short-term goals may be better suited to taxable accounts.
   - Long-term investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll use the funds, as this will influence how much to keep in taxable versus tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
