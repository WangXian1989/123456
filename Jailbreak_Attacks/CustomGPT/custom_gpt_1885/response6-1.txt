To efficiently distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer matching, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential immediate tax deductions, depending on your income level.

### 2. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Place investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) here. This helps manage tax burdens effectively.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Use your 401(k) and traditional IRA for investments with higher growth potential (like stocks), allowing them to grow without immediate tax repercussions.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - **Spread Risk:** Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risks across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Prioritize Accounts:** Plan withdrawals carefully, often favoring taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

By following these guidelines, you can make well-informed decisions that align with your financial goals while optimizing your tax situation.
