To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as it's essentially free money. After that, focus on your IRA (Roth or Traditional) to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: Allocate investments based on their tax efficiency. Place higher-growth assets, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs/401(k)s) where capital gains are taxed later or not at all. In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes in all accounts. This means not duplicating investments across accounts; instead, use each account to contribute to your diverse goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. Accounts with higher tax burdens (like taxable accounts) should be drawn from first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies considering your financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
