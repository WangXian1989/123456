Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a recommended approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, ensure you have paid off any high-interest debt that could negate your investment gains.

3. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get the employer match. If possible, increase your contributions to the maximum allowed, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax strategy. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth investments (like stocks) since these accounts grow tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable accounts**: Place investments that generate interest or short-term gains (like bonds or high-yield savings) to avoid paying higher taxes on these earnings in your taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly assess your portfolio allocations based on market performance, changes to your financial situation, or retirement goals. Adjust your investments to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re far from retirement, you can afford to take more risks; if you’re near retirement, focus on preserving capital.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain a sufficient emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses in low-risk accounts.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
