Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts efficiently can help optimize your tax benefits and investment growth. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider the Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income. These accounts grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not provide tax advantages for contributions or growth, but you can optimize for capital gains treatment, which is generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term goals may be better served by a taxable account.
   - Long-term investments, especially those for retirement, can benefit from tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding more growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Keep more income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

6. **Rebalancing and Tax Efficiency**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation. Also, consider tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset capital gains.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Managing withdrawals from these accounts tax-efficiently can minimize your tax burden over time.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation and financial goals.
