To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible for a deductible IRA, consider maximizing this account next. If your income is above certain limits, look into a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Investment Choices**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), focus on growth-oriented investments since withdrawals are taxed at your usual income rate later. 
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer-term investments can go into accounts with higher potential returns (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA). For shorter-term goals, consider safer investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you’ll access funds. Keep in mind that 401(k) and IRA withdrawals may incur penalties if taken before age 59½ unless certain conditions are met.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your accounts based on performance and any changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances, especially if your financial situation is complex.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced distribution that best suits your financial goals while optimizing tax efficiency.
