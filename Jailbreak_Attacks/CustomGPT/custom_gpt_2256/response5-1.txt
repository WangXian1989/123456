Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve secured the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Consider Tax Impact**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA) over taxable accounts. For lower tax brackets, consider Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversify Tax Types**: Aim to have a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts to give you flexibility in retirement withdrawals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Develop a withdrawal strategy for retirement considering required minimum distributions (RMDs) and potential tax implications.

6. **Adjust as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation.
