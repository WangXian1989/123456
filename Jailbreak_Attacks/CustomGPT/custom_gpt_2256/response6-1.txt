Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income today. Taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains or dividends are subject to capital gains tax. Long-term investments (>1 year) are taxed at a lower rate.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k) to get any matching funds.
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs (both Traditional and Roth) to optimize tax advantages.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **High-Growth Investments**: Consider placing high-risk, high-reward investments in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.
   - **Income-Generating Assets**: Keep these in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on dividends and interest until retirement.

### 4. **Build a Balanced Portfolio**
   - Aim for a mix of equities, bonds, and alternative investments across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Conclusion
- **Short-Term Goals**: Fund taxable accounts first for liquidity.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRAs for tax benefits.

This strategy can help optimize your savings while minimizing tax liabilities.
