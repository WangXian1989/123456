Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a diverse mix of investments suited to your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount each year.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or for funds you may need before retirement age.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on long-term investments and consider tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips
- **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts rather than within each one to leverage tax advantages effectively.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, or life changes.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal advice can be valuable based on your unique situation.

This approach typically leads to a more effective investment strategy, maximizing growth while considering taxes.
