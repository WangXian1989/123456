Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, age, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). This can provide tax advantages depending on your income level and retirement goals.

3. **Max Out 401(k):** If you still have funds available for retirement savings, consider maxing out your 401(k), which typically has higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a taxable account. These funds offer more flexibility and can be accessed without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Keep an eye on the tax implications of each account type. Traditional accounts may provide tax deductions now but could result in taxes later, while Roth accounts permit tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Make sure to diversify your investments within each account. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
