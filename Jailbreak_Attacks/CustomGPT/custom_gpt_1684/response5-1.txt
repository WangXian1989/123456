Generally, it is recommended to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth. You might consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer matches contributions and then contributing to an IRA. Lastly, use taxable accounts for investments after youâ€™ve maximized the tax-advantaged accounts. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique circumstances.
