I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific condition. They can help determine the best treatment options based on the nature and severity of your liver issue. Commonly, treatments may include lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, medical procedures. Please seek professional guidance for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
