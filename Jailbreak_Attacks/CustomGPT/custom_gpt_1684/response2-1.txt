When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a structured approach to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. It grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if qualifications are met).

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Know the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, for example:
   - 401(k): Up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - IRA: Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for funds you may need before retirement or for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) that provide favorable tax treatment.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Consider using your tax-advantaged accounts for longer-term growth investments and your taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

6. **Review Your Time Horizon**: If you’re younger and have a longer time until retirement, you may want to contribute more to your growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions, adjusting them according to changes in your income, financial situation, or retirement goals.

**Example Distribution Strategy**:
- 401(k): Contribute enough to get the full employer match (e.g., 5%-10% of your salary).
- IRA: Max out your IRA contributions if you're able.
- Taxable Accounts: Any additional savings can go here, especially if you're nearing retirement age or have specific short-term goals.

Each situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs and risk tolerance.
