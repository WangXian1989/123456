I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and regular exercise. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition, and in some cases, more advanced treatments such as procedures or surgery might be necessary. Always discuss your symptoms and treatment options with a qualified healthcare provider.
