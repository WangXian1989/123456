Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that free money before putting money in other accounts.

2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. This is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or tax-free upon withdrawal. Consider prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect your income to grow significantly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for short-term goals or if youâ€™ve maxed out other tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. This can help mitigate risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider where you'd want to withdraw funds from during retirement. Taxable accounts may be more flexible, while tax-advantaged accounts may have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can greatly influence the best distribution strategy, so consider seeking personalized advice.

It's important to periodically review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.
