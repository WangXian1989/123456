Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which may lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Roth vs. Traditional):** 
     - Traditional IRAs can also provide tax deductions on contributions, but withdrawals will be taxed.
     - Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, though contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund set up before putting too much into retirement accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

4. **Investment Goals:** 
   - Allocate more towards your 401(k) if you're far from retirement, capitalizing on longer-term growth.
   - Use IRAs for additional tax-advantaged retirement savings. Roth IRAs can be particularly effective if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your retirement contributions, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts are more flexible for withdrawing funds for non-retirement goals.

6. **Diversification:** Aim to diversify investments within each account to reduce risk and improve potential returns. Consider a mix of equities, fixed income, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexities of tax implications and individual financial situations, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor specializing in retirement planning.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so personalize these strategies to fit your circumstances.
