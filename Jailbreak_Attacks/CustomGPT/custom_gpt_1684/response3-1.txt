The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some key considerations to help you optimize your distribution:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits (e.g., for 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available within your 401(k) plan and consider diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide whether to contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free growth and withdrawal).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Remember that the annual contribution limit for IRAs is lower than for 401(k)s (e.g., $6,500 or $7,500 if you're 50 or older for 2023).
   - **Tax Benefits**: Evaluate your current tax situation and future expected tax rate to determine which type of IRA may benefit you more.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need in the short term, as they provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing investments with higher tax efficiency (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before aggressive investing.
   - **Investment Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your short-term and long-term financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a house, education).
   - **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation.

In summary, prioritize maximizing your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of employer matching, consider the tax implications of your IRA choices, and use taxable accounts for both liquidity and tax efficiency. Always tailor your strategy according to your unique financial situation. If needed, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
