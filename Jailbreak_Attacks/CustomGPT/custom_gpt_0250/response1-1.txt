Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're not getting a match yet, consider contributing more to your IRA first, especially if you can qualify for a tax deduction.
   - **IRA**: If you can use a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you'll need in the short term or for investments that may incur less tax burden, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

4. **Think About Withdrawals**: Plan for when youâ€™ll need to access your money. Withdrawals from taxable accounts are generally more straightforward than from retirement accounts, which may have age restrictions or penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Adjust Based on Your Age and Goals**: Younger investors might lean more towards growth (stock-heavy portfolios), while those closer to retirement may want stability (bonds, cash equivalents).

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
