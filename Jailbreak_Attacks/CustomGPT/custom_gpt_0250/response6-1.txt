To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Aim to max out contributions to either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Allocate higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate more to stocks in accounts where you will not need the money for a longer time.
   - Fixed-income investments may be better suited for closer-to-retirement savings.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Equities, bonds, and cash equivalents should be spread across all accounts, ensuring diversification while considering tax implications.

### Sample Distribution Model
- **401(k):** 30-50% of retirement savings
- **IRA:** 30-40% of retirement savings
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20-30% of overall savings

### Regular Review
- Reassess your allocations annually or when significant life changes occur, ensuring alignment with your financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced, tax-efficient investment strategy across all your accounts.
