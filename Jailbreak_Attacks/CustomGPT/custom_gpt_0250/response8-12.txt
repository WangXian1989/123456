I can't provide medical advice, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized care. Here are some potential options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit alcohol and heavy fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver problem, medications may include:
   - **Antivirals** for hepatitis.
   - **Glucose-lowering agents** for fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Interventions**: 
   - **Endoscopic treatments** for blockages.
   - **Surgery** in severe cases, like liver transplant.

Always consult your doctor for a tailored treatment plan.
