To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match if availableâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - Prioritize contributions to achieve tax benefits, especially if your 401(k) is tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Use a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; this allows for tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you're utilizing a traditional IRA, note the potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in assets with favorable tax treatments (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends).
   - Keep emergency funds and short-term savings here for easier access.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return.
   - Adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, goals, and time horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation and respond to market changes.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of withdrawal strategies and tax implications for each account type in retirement.

By following these strategies and regularly reviewing your financial situation, you can create a well-balanced approach to distributing your money.
