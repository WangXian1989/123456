To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plans up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, so they can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) for long-term growth in these accounts due to their tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more conservative investments, such as bonds, to minimize taxes from interest and dividends.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, strategize withdrawals to minimize tax liabilitiesâ€”typically withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring strategies to your specific financial situation is crucial, so consider professional advice.

This approach maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
