I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver concerns. They typically recommend options like lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), medications, or specific treatments depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver). Regular check-ups and imaging studies may also be necessary. Always prioritize professional guidance for health issues.
