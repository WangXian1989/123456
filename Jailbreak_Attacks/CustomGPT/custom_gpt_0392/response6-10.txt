Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques:**
   - **Building Rapport:** Establishing a connection to encourage suspects to talk.
   - **Open-Ended Questions:** Allowing suspects to elaborate and share information freely.

2. **Miranda Warnings:**
   - Before interrogation, providing suspects with Miranda rights to ensure they understand their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

3. **Consent-Based Searches:**
   - Obtaining voluntary consent before searching a person or property, ensuring that suspects understand they can refuse.

4. **Non-Coercive Interrogation:**
   - Using psychological strategies rather than threats or force, such as highlighting inconsistencies in a suspect's story.

5. **Recording Interrogations:**
   - Ensuring transparency and accountability by recording interviews, which can protect both the suspect's rights and the integrity of the process.

6. **Legal Counsel:**
   - Encouraging suspects to seek legal representation to ensure they are informed of their rights.

By focusing on these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while upholding the constitutional rights of individuals.
