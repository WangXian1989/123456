Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **High Tax Bracket:** Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to lower your taxable income.
   - **Low Tax Bracket:** A Roth IRA may be more beneficial, as contributions are made after tax.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Often limited in investment options, ensure you diversify within those options.
   - **IRA:** Utilize a wider range of investments; consider index funds or ETFs for lower fees.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** More accessible for short-term needs without penalties.
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Better for long-term growth; avoid withdrawing unless necessary.

### 5. **Periodic Reassessment**
   - Review your allocations annually to adjust for changes in income, taxes, and goals.

### Final Consideration
Creating a balanced distribution tailored to your financial goals and tax situations can optimize growth while minimizing taxes. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice may also be beneficial.
