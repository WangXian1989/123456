Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves careful consideration of several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now. Think about your future tax bracket when you withdraw funds.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for savings not tied to retirement, keeping in mind capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before committing large amounts to retirement accounts.

4. **Debt Management:** If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before maximizing retirement contributions.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly:** Adjust your contributions and allocations as your income, goals, and market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
