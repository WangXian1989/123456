Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions for contributions.
   - **401(k)**: Increase contributions to the 401(k) after the IRA limit is met, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for shorter-term goals or if you want more control over your investments. Use them for investments that generate lower taxable income (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends).

### 4. **Balance Between Accounts**
   - Assess your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, ensuring you maintain a balanced risk profile.
   - Be mindful of tax implications—consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Revise your distribution strategy annually or as your financial situation changes (like income changes or significant life events).

### Conclusion
In general, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, then taxable accounts as needed, adjusting based on your goals and tax situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
