Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and minimize taxes. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the annual limit (or a percentage of your salary) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Consider these for additional savings, especially for short-term goals or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing here.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) for long-term growth due to their tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation and goals.
