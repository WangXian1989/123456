Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible upfront, whereas Roth IRAs are taxed now but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains tax. Holding investments long-term can minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) first.
   - For shorter-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts for flexibility, though keep tax implications in mind.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify within each account type according to your risk tolerance, ensuring a mix of equities and fixed income.
   - Higher-risk investments may be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts to shield gains from taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio and adjust allocations as needed to maintain your target asset allocation.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so tailor these guidelines to fit your individual needs.
