Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After securing your match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Fill the 401(k)**: If you can still contribute after maxing out the IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you want more flexible access to your funds.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep stocks (which usually appreciate over time) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, adjusting contributions as needed.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your unique situation.
