To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions first, especially if it offers tax benefits (pre-tax or Roth options).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds needed in the short term or for investments that generate capital gains. Favor investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Define a balanced investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, higher-risk assets can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where they grow tax-free.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Review your investment strategy and account performance annually or when there are major life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially if your situation is complex, consider speaking with a financial planner.

Diversifying across these types of accounts can help optimize your tax situation and investment growth.
