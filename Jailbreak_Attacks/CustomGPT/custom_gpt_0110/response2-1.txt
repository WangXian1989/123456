Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Pay off any high-interest debts before investing more.

3. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth) or a Traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth). Aim to max out contributions if possible.

4. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: Once the IRA is funded, go back to maxing out your 401(k). Consider if a Roth 401(k) option is better for you based on your tax situation.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After funding retirement accounts, allocate money to taxable accounts for flexibility, especially if you plan to access funds before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure diversified investment across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Adjust Annually**: Review your distribution strategy annually to reflect changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
