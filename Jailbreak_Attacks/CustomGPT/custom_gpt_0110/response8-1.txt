To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing this out (up to the limit) if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your tax situation). If eligible, aim to max out the contribution.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments according to your goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations that fit your unique situation.
