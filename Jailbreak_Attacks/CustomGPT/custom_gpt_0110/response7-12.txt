1. **Dietary Changes**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol, processed foods, and high-fat meals.

2. **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the strain on your liver.

3. **Regular Exercise**: Physical activity improves overall health and can help manage liver conditions.

4. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver problem (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe medications or supplements.

5. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial.
