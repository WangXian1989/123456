To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Invest in a mix of assets (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.  
   - Keep more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter them from taxes.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and respond to market changes.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and maintaining an appropriate asset allocation, you can maximize growth while minimizing tax liability.
