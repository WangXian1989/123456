Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits and good investment options, maximize contributions here.
   - **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, but traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits. Choose based on your tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, divert extra funds to taxable accounts. These offer flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you need access to funds soon, prioritize taxable accounts since there are fewer penalties for early withdrawal compared to retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust contributions and allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances.
