To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match. Aim to max out contributions if possible, as these contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, prioritize funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Higher Growth Investments**: Place stocks or high-growth assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates, which are typically lower than ordinary income tax rates.
   - **Income Generating Assets**: Keep bonds or dividend-paying stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts, as the income from these is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts. Hold assets long enough to qualify for long-term rates.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation as markets fluctuate.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Tailor your approach based on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

This strategy can help ensure your investments are as tax-efficient as possible and aligned with your retirement objectives.
