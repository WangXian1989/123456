To optimize your distribution of money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if your employer offers a match. This reduces your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Account**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account to maintain flexibility. This allows you to withdraw funds without penalties, although you'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Generally, itâ€™s wise to hold tax-inefficient assets (like bond funds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: In retirement, develop a strategy for withdrawing from these accounts. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your strategy to your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline is crucial. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

Review your investment strategy periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals. Consider rebalancing your portfolio as needed.
