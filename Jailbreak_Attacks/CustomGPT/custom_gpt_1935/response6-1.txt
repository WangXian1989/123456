Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to optimize tax benefits and growth potential. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit. This is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If you can, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for a potential tax deduction, depending on your income level.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs.
   - **Consider Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains with losses in taxable accounts to ease your tax burden.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Equities in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since these accounts grow tax-deferred, holding higher-growth assets like stocks can be advantageous.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Interest income from bonds can be taxed at a higher rate, making them a better choice for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Continuous Review**:
   - **Adjust Based on Market Conditions**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation to respond to market shifts and changes in your financial goals.

By balancing contributions to your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts wisely, you can aim for a mix that supports your long-term financial stability and growth while minimizing taxes where possible. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
