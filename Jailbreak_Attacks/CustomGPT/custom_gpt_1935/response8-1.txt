Distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic to maximize tax efficiency, growth potential, and liquidity. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options:** Consider the investment choices available in your 401(k), which may have limited options compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional):**
   - **Tax Advantages:** A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Max out contributions to your IRA after your 401(k) match, if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use these for funds you may need earlier than retirement. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match (e.g., 5-10% of your paycheck).
2. **IRA:** After your 401(k), max out your IRA contributions.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term growth investments.

### Regular Review:
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your portfolio allocation based on life changes, market conditions, and performance.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This approach can help you enhance your investment growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
