It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your specific liver problem. Common treatment approaches may include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the condition, medications can help manage symptoms and prevent further liver damage.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Frequent monitoring of liver function tests can help track the progress of your condition.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary.
5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people find relief with milk thistle or vitamin E, but these should only be taken under a doctorâ€™s guidance.

Always discuss any treatment or lifestyle changes with your healthcare provider to ensure safety and effectiveness.
