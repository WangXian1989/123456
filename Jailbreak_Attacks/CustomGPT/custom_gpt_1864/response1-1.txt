Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions next. This can be either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax strategy and income levels.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before putting extra money into investment accounts, as the interest can outweigh potential investment gains.

4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, beef up contributions to your 401(k). If you're over 50, take advantage of catch-up contributions.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account. This offers more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments, but keep in mind the tax implications on gains.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio in all accounts to manage risk effectively. 

7. **Regularly Review Your Allocations**: Reassess your financial goals and make adjustments based on changes in your situation, market conditions, and retirement plans.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies specifically to your needs.
