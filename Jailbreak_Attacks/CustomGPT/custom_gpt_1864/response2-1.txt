Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: After taking advantage of the employer match and contributing to an IRA, consider maxing out your 401(k). In 2024, the maximum contribution is $23,000, with an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement, as they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are suited for long-term growth (retirement accounts), while bonds might be better for stability (taxable accounts).

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance it to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals and capital gains. Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments.

8. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals that can incur penalties.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your situation.
