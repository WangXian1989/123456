Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for tax-deferred growth; consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth, especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. This is especially useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Investment Types**: 
   - In tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA), you might want to hold assets that generate higher taxable income, like bonds. 
   - In a taxable account, consider holding assets that produce capital gains (like stocks), which may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they meet your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
