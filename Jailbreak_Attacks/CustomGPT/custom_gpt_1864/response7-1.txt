To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to maximize employer match first, if available, as it's essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go here.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: These accounts reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Great for individuals expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments that produce long-term capital gains (like stocks) due to lower tax rates on those gains and the ability to control when you realize gains or losses.

3. **Investment Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually offers limited investment choices, typically mutual funds. Focus on a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: More freedom to invest in a range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs. Use this flexibility to tailor your investments to your goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for more liquid investments or those you might want to access before retirement, like a home purchase or major life expense.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds, especially if you're balancing taxes. Often, youâ€™d withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts for a more tax-efficient retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Revisit your allocations depending on market changes, your age, and changing financial goals. This helps maintain your desired risk level and goal alignment.

Consulting a financial advisor may also be beneficial for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
