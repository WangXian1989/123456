The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a top priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**: Once you've maximized the tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. These can offer more flexibility, especially for withdrawals before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment strategy across these accounts is diversified. This helps manage risk.

5. **Consider Time Horizon**: Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts with longer timelines (like 401(k) or IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage liquidity and tax implications.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize overall tax liability.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your circumstances change.
