Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to help you optimize your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider how much to contribute to your 401(k). Determine how much you can afford while balancing immediate needs and other savings goals.

3. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might be needed before retirement or for tax-advantaged investments. Be mindful of tax implications on investment gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and to respond to changes in market conditions.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When it comes time to withdraw, consider the tax implications. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (traditional 401(k) and IRA), and leaving tax-free accounts (Roth) for last.

8. **Tax Considerations**: Be proactive about understanding the tax implications of each account type, as this can impact your overall investment returns.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique situation and goals.
