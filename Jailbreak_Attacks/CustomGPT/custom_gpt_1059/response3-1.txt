Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions lower your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes apply upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax benefits at the time of contribution, but you have flexibility in withdrawals. Capital gains and dividends are taxable.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Better suited for higher income in your working years.
   - **Tax-free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Valuable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 4. **Assess Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you're closer to retirement, lean more toward preserving your capital in safer investments within tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For longer-term investments, you might allocate more to aggressive growth funds in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across different account types to balance risk and growth. Stocks may be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

### 6. **Annual Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. In 2024, the limits are:
     - 401(k): $23,000 (or $30,000 if over 50).
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 7. **Periodic Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
1. **Max out 401(k) contributions** to receive the full match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably Roth if eligible).
3. **Invest additional savings in a taxable account** for flexibility and access.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach considering tax efficiency, long-term growth, and liquidity needs can optimize your savings for retirement. Consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
