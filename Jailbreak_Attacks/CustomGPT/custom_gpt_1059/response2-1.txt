Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Action:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available. This is effectively "free money" and a great way to start your retirement savings.

### 2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**
   - **Action:** Pay off any high-interest debt (like credit cards) before making significant contributions to investment accounts.

### 3. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income; you pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this can be advantageous.
   - Aim to max out your contributions (currently $6,500 annually, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

### 4. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - After taking advantage of your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions to the maximum allowable limit (currently $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

### 5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider saving in taxable accounts. This is useful for funds you may need before retirement or for specific financial goals.
   - Opt for tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Consider Asset Location**
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts for potentially more favorable capital gains treatment.

### 7. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months’ worth of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing.

### 8. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your contributions and investment allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary.

### 9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It’s often wise to speak with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize tax benefits and enhance your retirement savings.
