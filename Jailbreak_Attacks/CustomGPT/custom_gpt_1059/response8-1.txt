Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here's a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, with taxes due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deductible contributions; evaluate based on your current vs. future tax bracket.

3. **Fund IRA Contributions**: Once you've maximized the employer match, direct excess funds to an IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement, or for non-retirement goals. Keep in mind the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Growth-oriented investments may be best held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable income-generating investments could fit well in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution periodically or when significant life changes occur (job changes, salary increases, etc.).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial professional can provide personalized advice considering the nuances of your situation, including tax optimization strategies.

This balanced approach can help you grow your savings while managing taxes effectively.
