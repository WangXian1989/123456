To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for the annual maximum contribution if possible.
- **IRA**: After your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your tax situation; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if income limits allow.

### 2. Diversify Investments 
- **401(k)**: Choose a mix of index funds, target-date funds, or more aggressive options based on your risk tolerance.
- **IRA**: Similar strategy with potentially more investment options, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs, enhancing diversification.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider investments that are less tax-heavy, like municipal bonds.

### 3. Adjust Contributions Based on Goals
- Set clear retirement and financial goals. If you aim for early retirement, prioritize aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts first. 
- For near-term goals, allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 4. Monitor and Rebalance
- Regularly review your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation. Rebalance as needed to prevent overexposure to certain asset classes due to market fluctuations.

These strategies can help optimize your financial growth while managing tax implications effectively.
