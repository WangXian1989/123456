Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you can take advantage of a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments for a profit, so consider holding lower-turnover investments there.

3. **Investment Goals:**
   - If you're saving for retirement, prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For shorter-term goals (like buying a house), a taxable account may be more appropriate.

4. **Risk Tolerance:**
   - Evaluate how much risk you’re comfortable taking and choose investments accordingly across all accounts.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is diversified, even if certain accounts are underfunded.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances.
