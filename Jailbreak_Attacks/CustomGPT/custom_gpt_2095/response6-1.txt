Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to capture the full match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- Use **taxable accounts** for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, as they typically incur less capital gains tax than actively managed funds.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- Within each account, ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligned with your risk tolerance. 

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 20% (with employer match)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: 15% 
- **Taxable Account**: 10% 

### Final Considerations
- Adjust your contributions based on your financial situation, and consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
