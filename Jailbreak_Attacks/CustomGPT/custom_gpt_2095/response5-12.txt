I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment can vary significantly based on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed. For instance, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through regular blood tests and imaging studies is essential.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some patients explore complementary therapies, but these should always be discussed with a healthcare provider.

For the best course of action, please speak with a liver specialist or your primary care doctor.
