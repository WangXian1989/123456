Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed annually, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments within each account based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Growth-oriented investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable income investments could be in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as needed, especially approaching retirement when you may want to decrease risk.

6. **Consider Your Withdrawals**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement, balancing withdrawals from taxable and tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your unique situation can be beneficial, ensuring you take full advantage of tax laws.

By balancing contributions strategically, you can optimize your retirement savings and investment growth.
