Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA if it offers tax benefits. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might prefer a Roth IRA. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts are more flexible in terms of withdrawals without penalties. They can be useful for shorter-term goals or emergency funds.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to reduce risk and enhance growth potential.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and your changing financial goals.

7. **Consider Fees and Investment Options**: Look at the fees associated with each account and the investment options available. Opt for low-cost index funds if possible.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Always evaluate your own situation and goals before making decisions.
