Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (plus catch-up contributions if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (also with catch-up options).

3. **Diversify Asset Allocation**:
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, retirement accounts might focus more on growth assets, while taxable accounts may include more conservative investments.

4. **Consider Tax Impact**:
   - Hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize your tax burden.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax implications, such as stocks that you plan to hold long-term to benefit from capital gains rates.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your holdings and adjust your strategy as necessary based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances can significantly impact the best strategy, so consulting with an advisor for tailored advice is often beneficial.

Remember, the optimal distribution will ultimately reflect your unique financial situation and long-term objectives.
