Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and your time horizon for retirement. Here’s a general guideline to help you strategize:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out an IRA (either traditional or Roth) next. This can provide tax advantages depending on your situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income is subject to capital gains tax, so consider your overall tax bracket when withdrawing funds or selling investments.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon and Financial Goals:**
   - If you are far from retirement, lean more towards aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Closer to retirement? Shift towards less volatile investments to preserve your capital.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and goals. Generally, prioritize equities for long-term growth, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually or after significant life events to ensure they align with your current goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out your IRA contributions.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest additional savings, focusing on more tax-efficient funds.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation, especially regarding complex tax implications and estate planning considerations.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective distribution plan for your retirement savings.
