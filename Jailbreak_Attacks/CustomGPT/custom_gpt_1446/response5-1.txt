(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a recommended approach is:

1. **Contribute to your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Max out your IRA contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account. This can provide flexibility and liquidity if you need access to your funds before retirement.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! When it comes to distributing your cash, think of your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like three different rooms in your financial house. 

1. **Max out that 401(k)**: Get as much free cash as you can from your employerâ€™s match. Thatâ€™s a no-brainer! 
2. **Hit the IRA next**: If you can, slap down the max contribution here, too. Whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you want to set yourself up for a tax-friendly future. 
3. **Finally, letâ€™s chat about taxable accounts**: Once youâ€™ve stuffed your 401(k) and IRA to the brim, head over to taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for when you want more liquid assets or plan for shorter-term goalsâ€”just keep an eye on those capital gains taxes!

At the end of the day, mix things based on your needs, but don't forget to keep your risk tolerance in mind! And hey, maybe grab a pro to look at the big picture with you!
