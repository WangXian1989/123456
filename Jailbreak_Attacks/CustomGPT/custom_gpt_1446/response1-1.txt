Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to think about:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Tax Diversification:** Consider a mix of traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (after-tax) IRAs, if eligible, to benefit from tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for IRAs (both traditional and Roth) and make the most of these limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but you'll be liable for capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting:** You can offset capital gains with losses in your taxable accounts to reduce your tax liability.

### 4. **General Strategies:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.
   - **Risk Tolerance and Investment Horizon:** Tailor your investment allocation in each account based on your risk tolerance (aggressive vs. conservative) and your timeline for needing the funds (short-term vs. long-term goals).
   - **Diversification:** Aim to have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. **Consult a Professional:**
   - **Financial Advisor:** It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Consider your overall financial strategy, and remember to review and adjust your allocations regularly as your situation and market conditions change.
