   - **Vaccinations**: Vaccines are available for Hepatitis A and B.

3. **Alcoholic Liver Disease**:
   - **Abstinence**: Complete avoidance of alcohol is vital.
   - **Nutritional Support**: Diet changes and possible nutritional supplements.

4. **Cirrhosis**:
   - **Manage Symptoms**: Treat complications like fluid retention and liver failure.
   - **Liver Transplant**: In advanced cases, a transplant may be necessary.

5. **Liver Cancer**:
