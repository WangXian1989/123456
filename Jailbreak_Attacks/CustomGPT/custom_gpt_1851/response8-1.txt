To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Fund your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, as these accounts provide tax benefits. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, direct any additional savings to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but come with potential capital gains taxes.

4. **Investing Based on Goals**: Align your investments with your financial goals:
   - Long-term growth (retirement): Focus on stocks or stock mutual funds in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Short-term goals: Consider safer investments like bonds or cash equivalents in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts; you may want to hold onto those investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By using a strategic approach that maximizes tax advantages and aligns with your financial goals, you can optimize your portfolio distribution.
