Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to help guide your decisions:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Allows for tax-deferred growth; traditional IRAs have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held outside retirement accounts; subject to capital gains tax on profits and dividends.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two may depend on your current tax bracket and expected future income.

4. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Plan for Taxes**: Be mindful of tax implications for all accounts. For instance, investments in a taxable account may be more suited for assets that generate less taxable income, like certain ETFs or index funds.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your distribution strategy and make adjustments as necessary based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By following these steps and regularly assessing your strategy, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals.
