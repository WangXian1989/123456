(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Typically, it's advisable to maximize employer match contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if it offers tax advantages. Finally, taxable accounts can be beneficial for additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. It's also important to consider asset allocation within each account, based on your investment goals and timelines. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
