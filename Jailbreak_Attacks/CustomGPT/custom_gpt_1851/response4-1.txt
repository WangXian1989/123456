The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income, consider which type of IRA is more beneficial for your situation.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older)

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - If your goal is long-term growth and maximizing retirement savings, prioritize maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing in a taxable account. 
   - For short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age, consider allocating more funds to taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Think about your investment strategy and how different accounts can hold varied investments. Typically, it's advised to place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep more growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains tax advantages.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you intend to withdraw funds during retirement. Understanding the tax implications of withdrawals can affect how you allocate your assets now.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Every individual's financial situation is unique. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.

Consider these factors to devise a strategy tailored to your needs and objectives.
