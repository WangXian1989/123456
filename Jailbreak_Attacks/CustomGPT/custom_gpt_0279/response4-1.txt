Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions here first, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility. Invest in assets that generate lower taxable income, like index funds and ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Investment Goals**: Allocate based on your time horizon and risk tolerance:
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Rebalance periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
