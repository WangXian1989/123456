Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your age, income, investment goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

### 3. **Fill Up Your 401(k)**:
   - Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions (annually up to the limit), continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. These can be more flexible for withdrawals and can also utilize tax-efficient investment strategies.

### 5. **Monitor and Rebalance**: 
   - Regularly check your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Be aware of taxes on withdrawals from retirement accounts and capital gains in taxable accounts.
- **Investment Choices**: Different accounts may offer varying investment options, consider where to allocate high-growth investments versus income-generating investments.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation.
