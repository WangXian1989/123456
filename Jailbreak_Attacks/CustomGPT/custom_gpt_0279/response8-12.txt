I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. Treatment typically depends on the specific liver condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Reduce sugar, salt, and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoiding or limiting alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition, specific medications might be prescribed (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes.

4. **Procedures**:
   - For advanced liver disease, procedures such as a liver biopsy or imaging studies may be necessary.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be an option.

6. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may consider herbal supplements, but it's crucial to consult a doctor due to potential interactions.

Consult a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment and personalized treatment options.
