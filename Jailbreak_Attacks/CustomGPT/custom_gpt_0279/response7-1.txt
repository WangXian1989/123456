To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or ETFs. Keep in mind capital gains tax when selling investments in these accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a diversified investment mix across all accounts to balance risk. This includes stocks, bonds, and other asset classes appropriate for your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement, typically drawing first from taxable accounts, then 401(k), and finally IRA, to minimize tax liabilities over time.
