I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment for liver problems varies widely depending on the specific condition. Common options include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the liver issue, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: For chronic liver conditions, regular check-ups and monitoring are essential.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like endoscopy or surgery might be necessary.

5. **Transplant**: For advanced liver disease, a liver transplant may be considered.

It's crucial to discuss your situation with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.
