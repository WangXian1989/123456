Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. IRA contributions can provide tax deductions (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth) in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k) for Traditional IRAs; choose a Roth if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments. Use these for short-term savings or when you need more flexibility.

### 4. **Diversity in Investments**
   - Diversify your investments within each account type as well. Different asset classes can help manage risk.

### 5. **Adjusting Based on Age and Retirement Timeline**
   - Younger investors might favor growth-focused investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while those nearing retirement might shift toward income-generating assets.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (maximizing employer match)
- **IRA**: Use remaining contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts

Adjust based on your financial goals and situation.
