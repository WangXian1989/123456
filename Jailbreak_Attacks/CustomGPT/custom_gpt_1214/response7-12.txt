1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats, sugars, and processed foods can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Steroids or immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and personalized treatment. If you have any specific symptoms or conditions, please share, and I can provide more targeted information.
