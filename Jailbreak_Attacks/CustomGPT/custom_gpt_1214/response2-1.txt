Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA can be tax-deductible.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After funding the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit if you haven’t done so already (e.g., $22,500 for 2024).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can contribute to a taxable investment account. This is beneficial for flexibility and liquidity, though it lacks the tax benefits of retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance:
   - **401(k)**: Might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other options available in the plan.
   - **IRA**: Offers a broader range of investment choices, so consider diversifying here based on your targets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across retirement and taxable accounts.
