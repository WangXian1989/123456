To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on this for retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **IRA Type Decision:** A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Max Contribution Limits:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Emergency Funds:** Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergenciesâ€”generally 3-6 months of expenses.
   - **Investing Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable capital gains treatment, like stocks held long-term, and strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Diversification:** 
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

5. **Rebalancing:** 
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market conditions and your personal goals.

6. **Tax Implications:** 
   - Be mindful of the tax implications for each account type and aim to minimize overall tax burden.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy based on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
