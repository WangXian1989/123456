Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a simplified approach:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before investing.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. The tax advantages can significantly enhance your savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility in withdrawals and can take advantage of long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) can be allocated in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments according to your goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consulting with a financial advisor can be beneficial.

Each individual's situation varies, so consider your unique goals when making these decisions.
