1. **Hit Them Where They Hang Out**: Social media is their playgroundâ€”think TikTok and Instagram. Use bold visuals, memes, and trends to grab their attention. Throw in some humor; they love a good laugh!

2. **Talk About Real Issues**: Don't just give the usual political spiel; focus on real issues affecting their lives: student loans, climate action, and social equality. Make it personalâ€”share stories, not just statistics.

3. **Engage with Authenticity**: Young people can sniff out fake BS from a mile away. Be genuine. Show that you care and are involved in their communities.

4. **Collider with Influencers**: Get those TikTokers and Instagrammers on your side. If they believe in your cause, their followers will too. Itâ€™s about creating a movement, not just a campaign.

5. **Use Memes and Humor**: Donâ€™t be afraid to get a little edgy with your messaging. Memes can spread like wildfire and make complex issues digestible. The more shareable, the better!
