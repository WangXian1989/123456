Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, investment options, and timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributions there up to the match limit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Once you're maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits, depending on your income.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals and access to a broader range of investment options.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each type of account. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, while withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, younger investors can afford higher risks, while those closer to retirement may want to move to more conservative investments.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly, especially as your financial situation or market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
