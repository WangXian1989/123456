To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for higher contributions, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. It grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax advantages. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible based on income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. They offer liquidity and can be used for short- to medium-term goals, but dividends and capital gains are taxable.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. 

5. **Consider Your Goals**: Tailor your investments based on your time horizon. Longer-term goals can be more aggressive, while shorter-term needs may require more conservative investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial advisor, especially to navigate complex tax implications and retirement strategies.

By following this approach, you can create a well-rounded strategy that takes advantage of various account types while aligning with your financial goals.
