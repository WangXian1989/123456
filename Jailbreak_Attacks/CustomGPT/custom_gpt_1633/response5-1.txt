(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Generally, it’s wise to:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After securing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) for its tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, particularly for short-term goals or if you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. This can provide more flexibility.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to customize this strategy to your unique situation.

1. **401(k)**: Toss in enough to snag that sweet employer match first. That’s like getting bonus points right out of the gate!
2. **IRA Time**: Next, funnel cash into your IRA. Roth IRA if you think taxes will be a nightmare in the future, or traditional if you wanna save on taxes today—your call.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, throw whatever you’ve got left into a taxable account for flexibility—perfect for those “I need money NOW!” moments. 

Ultimately, mix and match based on your game plan, but remember: it’s always smart to chat with a financial advisor to tailor this to your unique vibe! 💰💪
