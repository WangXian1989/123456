When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies to consider based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts provide additional tax advantages.

3. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, like credit card debt, it might be wise to prioritize paying that off before increasing contributions to retirement accounts.

4. **Funding Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions (or if you're ineligible for them), start funding your taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals since they donâ€™t come with the same penalties or restrictions as retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each type of account according to your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Younger investors may lean towards stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer more stable investments.

6. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. For example, traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as income, while Roth IRA withdrawals may be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your circumstances.
