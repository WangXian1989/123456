The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This account is great for tax-deferred growth. If you have a high tax bracket, this can help lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider funding it next, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now but tax you upon withdrawal.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts or if you're unsure about future tax implications, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment goals. Generally, younger investors can take more risks, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on stability.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and contributions, especially as your financial situation or market conditions change. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best distribution for your unique situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

Ultimately, the best approach requires balancing growth potential with tax considerations while keeping your overall financial goals in mind.
