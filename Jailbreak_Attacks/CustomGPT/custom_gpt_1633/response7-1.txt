The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, current tax situation, and retirement timeframe. Here are some general tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your situation) to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**: 
   - Generally, you want to place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on any capital gains.
   - Consider placing investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in a taxable account, as they may be taxed at ordinary income rates in tax-deferred accounts.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your investment choices across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk while aiming for growth.

4. **Age and Time Horizon**: 
   - If you are younger and have a long time until retirement, you might want to lean towards more aggressive growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

5. **Regular Monitoring and Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review your allocation and make adjustments based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or changes in your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If unsure, it may be beneficial to discuss with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies that fit your specific needs.

Ultimately, the goal is to optimize for growth while minimizing taxes to help ensure you reach your financial goals.
