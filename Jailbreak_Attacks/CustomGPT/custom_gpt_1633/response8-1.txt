The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. These accounts provide tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Consider contributing here if you donâ€™t have a 401(k) option.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, focus on Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)). Conversely, if you expect a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be better.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before allocating excessive funds to investments. This should generally cover 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: In taxable accounts, you may want to hold investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs. For tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on growth-oriented investments without worrying as much about taxes.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor, especially if you have complex financial situations or specific goals.

Ultimately, the best strategy is tailored to your individual circumstances, so take your time to evaluate your options.
