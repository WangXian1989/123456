Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer match options; contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - Next, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA which allows for tax-free growth.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Focus on tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to remain in the same tax bracket or higher in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Adjust According to Age**:
   - Younger individuals can afford to take more risks with a higher allocation in equities.
   - As you age, gradually shift toward more conservative investments, preserving capital as retirement nears.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consider Other Factors**:
   - Keep emergency savings in a separate account for unexpected expenses and ensure you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.
