Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Divide investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. More aggressive investments might be appropriate in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative options could be in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax implications and individual circumstances, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation.

It’s essential to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances, so consider revisiting your allocations regularly as your financial situation changes.
