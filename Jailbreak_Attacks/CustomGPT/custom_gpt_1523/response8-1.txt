Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the maximum employer match if available; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantage**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth), reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose based on your expected tax situation. Roth IRAs are good for younger investors expecting higher future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and take advantage of catch-up contributions if you’re over 50.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or if you need liquidity. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved before heavily investing.
- **Long-Term Focus**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### Example Allocation
1. **401(k)**: Max out employer match first, then consider contributing up to the annual limit.
2. **IRA**: Contribute as much as you can (prioritize Roth if you believe you’ll be in a higher tax bracket later).
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any excess after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Review Regularly
- Reassess your strategy annually or when major life changes occur (job change, marriage, etc.).
