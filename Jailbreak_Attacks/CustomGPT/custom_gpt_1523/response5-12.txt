I'm not a doctor, but if you have liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional. Treatment often varies based on the specific liver condition. Here are some common options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups to monitor liver function and progression.
4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, treatments like liver transplants might be necessary.
5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from specific vitamins or herbal supplements, but consult your doctor before starting any.

Be sure to discuss your symptoms and any treatment options with a healthcare provider to find the best personalized plan for you.
