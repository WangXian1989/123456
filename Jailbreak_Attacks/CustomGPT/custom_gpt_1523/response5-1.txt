Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. Then, maximize contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth, based on your situation).

2. **Consider tax implications**: Use taxable accounts for investments with lower capital gains (like index funds or ETFs) and keep higher-income investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversify investment types**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts for overall risk management.

4. **Rebalance regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocation as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Plan for withdrawals**: Consider how your accounts will be taxed when you retire, and plan withdrawals accordingly to minimize tax impact.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
