Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Start with this for its immediate tax benefits. Consider traditional or Roth options based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **IRA**: If you have additional funds, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexible access to funds. Ideal for investments that may benefit from favorable long-term capital gains tax rates (e.g., stocks).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on tax efficiency. Generally, itâ€™s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
