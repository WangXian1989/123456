I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's really important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, exercise, avoiding alcohol, or medications if there's an underlying condition. Always get tailored advice from your doctor to ensure the best care for your specific situation!
