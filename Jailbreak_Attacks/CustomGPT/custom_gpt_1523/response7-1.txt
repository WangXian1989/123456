To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if your employer matches. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility. Use them for shorter-term goals or investments you may want to access before retirement without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Balance your portfolio within each account, diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk and enhance growth potential.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and allocations based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
