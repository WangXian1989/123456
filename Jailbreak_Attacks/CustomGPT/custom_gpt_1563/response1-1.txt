When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be considered, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, and your retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive approach to help you make informed decisions:

### **1. Understand Each Account Type**

- **401(k)**
  - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), reducing your taxable income.
  - **Employer Match:** Take full advantage of any employer match programâ€”itâ€™s free money!
  - **Contribution Limits:** As of 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over age 50).

- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
  - **Types:** Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) and Roth IRA (post-tax contributions).
  - **Tax Advantages:** Similar to 401(k), but wider investment options.
  - **Contribution Limits:** $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50) for 2023.

- **Taxable Accounts**
  - **No Contribution Limits:** You can invest as much as you want, but you don't receive tax advantages.
  - **Capital Gains Taxes:** You'll pay taxes on gains when you sell investments.

### **2. Prioritization of Contributions**

#### **Step-by-Step Approach**

1. **Max Out Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA after reaching the match in your 401(k). These accounts can offer tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**
   - After funding the IRA, shift focus back to your 401(k) and aim to max it out if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts Last**
   - If youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and have additional funds, consider investing in a taxable account. This is beneficial for more immediate financial goals or for flexibility in accessing funds.

### **3. Asset Allocation Strategy**

- Diversify your investments to spread risk. A common rule is to base your allocation on age (subtract your age from 100 to determine the percentage of stocks vs. bonds).
- Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### **4. Consider Tax Implications**

- **Withdrawal Timing:** Be mindful of tax implications upon withdrawal from each account type.
- **Long-term Growth:** Funds in tax-advantaged accounts can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, making them often more beneficial for long-term savings.

### **5. Consult a Financial Advisor**

- Personal circumstances can vary: income level, tax bracket, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance are critical.
- A financial advisor can provide tailored advice and help optimize your overall financial strategy.

### **Example Allocation Strategy**

| Account Type         | Priority Level | Contribution Strategy          |
|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 401(k)               | High           | Max out employer match, then max contributions |
| IRA                  | High           | Max contributions if eligible  |
| Taxable Account      | Low            | Invest surplus after maxing out retirement accounts |

### **Conclusion**

Distributing your money wisely across different accounts can significantly impact your financial future. Aim to maximize employer matches, take advantage of tax benefits, and maintain a diversified portfolio. Always revisit your strategy as your financial situation evolves!
