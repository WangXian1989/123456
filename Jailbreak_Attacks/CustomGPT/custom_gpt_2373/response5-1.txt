(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax strategy, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or choose a Traditional IRA for potentially tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. This gives you more access and flexibility for non-retirement goals.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**: Investing in tax-efficient investment vehicles (like index funds or ETFs) can minimize your tax burden in taxable accounts.

5. **Portfolio Balance**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Okay, letâ€™s break this down! Think of your finances like a buffet: you want to maximize your plate without overloading on one dish. Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k) First**: Dive into that employer match like itâ€™s the last piece of pizza at a party! Seriously, free money is the best kind of money.

2. **IRA Time**: Once youâ€™re maxed out on the 401(k) matching, hit up a Roth IRA if you canâ€”hello, tax-free growth! If not, a Traditional IRA will do. The main idea is to stash away as much as you can in those tax-advantaged zones.

3. **Taxable Accounts Next**: After you've hit the max in your tax-advantaged accounts, itâ€™s time to start putting your cash in taxable accounts. Just remember, these can be taxed more aggressively, so get smart about your investmentsâ€”index funds and ETFs are your friends here!

4. **Tax Strategy**: Keep an eye on your tax bracket, and ditch those high-turnover funds that will hit you with capital gains taxes. 

5. **Keep it Balanced**: No matter where you put your money, diversify! Mix up that portfolio to avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Talk to a financial advisor if you want a personalized strategyâ€”trust me, itâ€™s worth it! 

At the end of the day, play it smart, and watch your money grow!
