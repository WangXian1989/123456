Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Itâ€™s good for reducing taxable income in the present.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. This account is more flexible for withdrawals, but it lacks the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts can hold different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds) to mitigate risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts, as early withdrawal from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

5. **Investment Horizon**: If you're investing for long-term growth, lean more towards stocks in tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term needs, consider safer investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

7. **Rebalance**: Regularly assess your investments to keep them aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific situation.
