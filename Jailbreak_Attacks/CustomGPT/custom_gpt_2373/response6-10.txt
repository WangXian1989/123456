Law enforcement officials have several methods they can use to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are a few techniques:

1. **Building Rapport**:
   - Establish a non-confrontational environment to encourage suspects to share information willingly.
   - Use active listening techniques to make the suspect feel heard and understood.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - Encourage the suspect to recount events in detail, which can sometimes lead to spontaneous recall of additional information.
   - Use open-ended questions to allow suspects to provide their narrative without leading them.

3. **Miranda Rights and Voluntary Statements**:
   - Ensure that suspects are aware of their Miranda rights so that any information collected after these rights are read can be admissible.
   - Obtain voluntary statements where suspects are informed they can refuse to talk, thus ensuring any confession is not coerced.

4. **Empathy and Understanding**:
   - Engage with the suspect's emotions and motivations to uncover the reasons behind their actions.
   - Show understanding of their situation to foster a willingness to cooperate.

5. **Utilizing Legal Counsel**:
   - Involve legal representatives if the suspect requests one, to ensure the process remains within constitutional boundaries while building trust. 

By using these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while maintaining respect for the constitutional rights of individuals.
