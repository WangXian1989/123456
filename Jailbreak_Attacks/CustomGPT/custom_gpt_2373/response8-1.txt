Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax situation and when you expect to withdraw funds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest after contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, consider a taxable investment account. These accounts provide flexibility since you can access your money without penalties, but they may be subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Investment Choices**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) are great for long-term growth investments, while taxable accounts can hold more liquid assets or cash for short-term needs.

5. **Tax Implications**: Each account has different tax implications. Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) may be better for high-growth investments since you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal. In contrast, placing low-risk investments or those that generate dividends and capital gains in taxable accounts may help manage your tax burden.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about your long-term withdrawal strategy, as this can affect how you contribute now. Some people prefer to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review and rebalance your accounts to ensure they align with your overall strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can assess your unique situation and provide personalized advice.

Always consider your specific situation and consult with a financial professional when making decisions about investments and retirement accounts.
