Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income for the year, while Roth 401(k) contributions are made with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the fund options available in your 401(k) for fees and performance.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - **Types**: Decide between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and if you’re eligible for deductibles based on your income level and filing status.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Flexibility and Access**: These accounts provide you with more flexibility as there are no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be aware of capital gains taxes on profits earned in these accounts and strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) (especially to get employer matches).
- Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for any additional investments once you’ve maxed out retirement accounts, especially for short-term needs or if you're in a high tax bracket.

Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your entire financial picture. 

Consider factors like your current age, retirement plans, risk tolerance, and how soon you will need to access your funds to tailor a strategy that best fits your needs.
