Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after taking care of your 401(k) contributions, especially if you're eligible for tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you still have funds to invest after contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - Understand how withdrawals from each account are taxed. Traditional accounts (401(k) and IRA) are taxed at your ordinary income rate upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met. Taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax based on your holding period.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments (stocks) since they will compound over time without immediate tax implications. In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) and bonds, as these can minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Factor in Your Financial Goals**:
   - Tailor your strategy based on your investment horizon. If youâ€™re saving for retirement, prioritize accounts with tax benefits. If you're looking to buy a home or fund education soon, taxable accounts may provide easier access to funds.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically assess your investment allocations and make adjustments as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insight and help you create a distribution strategy that aligns with your overall financial plans.
