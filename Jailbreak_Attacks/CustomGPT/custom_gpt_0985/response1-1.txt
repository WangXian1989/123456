To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out contributions to take advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Decide if you want to pay taxes now or later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term capital gains are taxed lower. Use these for flexible withdrawals and investments for growth.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and retirement accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your comfort with risk. Adjust your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) accordingly in each account.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. Ensure you’re not overexposed in one type of investment just because of where it’s held.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax benefits.

### Example Strategy:
- Max out your employer-matched 401(k) first.
- Contribute to an IRA (choose between Roth and Traditional based on your tax situation).
- Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts for flexible access.

It’s often wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation. How does that sound?
