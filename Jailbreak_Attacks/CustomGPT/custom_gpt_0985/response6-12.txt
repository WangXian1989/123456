I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for specific medical conditions. Generally, treatments might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Reducing alcohol intake
   - Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), antiviral medications or other treatments may be recommended.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging may help track liver health.

Consult a healthcare provider for a plan tailored to your situation.
