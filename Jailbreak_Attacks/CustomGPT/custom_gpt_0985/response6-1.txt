To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., long-term capital gains) and consider tax-efficient funds.
   - Balance your tax bracket to determine how much to allocate to each account type.

3. **Determine Investment Goals**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth; consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA**: Align investments with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility; use them for short- to medium-term goals, like buying a home or travel.

4. **Review Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure you're within annual contribution limits for each account type.

5. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Monitor your investment performance and adjust your allocations as needed based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

By balancing these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy for both short-term flexibility and long-term growth.
