To give tailored advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need a bit more information:

1. **Current Age**: How old are you, or what is your target retirement age?
2. **Goals**: What are your short-term and long-term financial goals?
3. **Risk Tolerance**: How do you feel about taking risks with investments?
4. **Income Level**: What is your current income, and do you expect it to change soon?
5. **Contribution Limits**: Are you aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA?

With this information, I can provide more specific recommendations!
