I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Common treatment options can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or reduce liver damage, and in some cases, medical procedures. Monitoring liver function regularly is also crucial. Please reach out to a medical expert to discuss your specific situation.
