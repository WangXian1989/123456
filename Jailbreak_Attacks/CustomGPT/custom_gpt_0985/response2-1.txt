To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Know Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Check the maximum contribution limit for the year (e.g., $22,500 for individuals under 50 in 2024).
   - **IRA:** Annual contributions are limited (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2024).

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing the employer match, consider maxing out an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here can generate capital gains, which may be taxed, but you have more flexibility in accessing funds.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Use your 401(k) and IRA for more aggressive growth assets (stocks), while keeping more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts for easier access to funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or reduce taxes.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - **Annual Review:** Assess your financial goals and market performance annually to rebalance your portfolio as needed.
   - **Retirement Timeline:** Adjust your allocation based on your proximity to retirement.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If unsure, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation and goals.

By focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged contributions and considering your overall investment strategy, you can effectively distribute your money across these accounts.
