To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, prioritizing a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Hold **stocks and growth assets** in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Place **bonds or income-generating assets** in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income (depending on your tax bracket).

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be aware of tax implications when withdrawing funds, especially from traditional accounts. Withdrawals from 401(k) and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess and rebalance your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Long-Term Focus**:
   - Keep a long-term perspective and avoid making reactive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
