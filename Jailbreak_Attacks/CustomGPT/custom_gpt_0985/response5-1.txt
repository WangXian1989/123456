(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, and current tax situation. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds here, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
