(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's a good idea to maximize contributions to accounts with tax advantages first. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 401(k)s is higher than for IRAs, and contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Traditional IRA can provide tax reductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for flexibility and liquidity, as you can withdraw funds without penalties.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down like this: your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can all play different roles in your investment strategy, and you want to leverage them like a pro!

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer matches contributions, go full throttle and get that match! It's like leaving money on the table if you don't. The max contribution is higher, which means you're stacking those tax-deferred dollars faster. Seriously, donâ€™t just wander through the kiddie pool when you can dive into the deep end of retirement savings.

2. **IRA**: Now for your IRA, whether it's a Traditional or Roth, get in while the gettin's good. If you're all about saving on taxes now, go Traditional; if you want tax-free money in retirement, Roth is your buddy. You can make those contributions based on your income, so don't sleep on it. Every dollar counts!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, weâ€™ve got those taxable accounts. After you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts (you genius), throw some cash in there too. They give you the flexibility to access your money sooner, no strings attached. Just be aware of taxes on your earnings. 

Always good to chat with a financial wizard to fine-tune this plan, but youâ€™ve got the basics to rock your financial world!
