The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k)â€”contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, this could be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed in the year they're realized. Ideal for those who may need access to funds before retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3 to 6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt (like credit cards) before investing.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Age Considerations**: The younger you are, the more you can focus on growth-oriented investments. As you approach retirement, consider gradually shifting towards more conservative investments.

7. **Investment Horizon**: The time frame for needing your money can dictate where you put it. Long-term investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

8. **Tax Optimization**: Consider putting more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts.

9. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your distribution and adjust based on performance, tax changes, and shifts in your financial goals.

10. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized planning tailored to your specific situation, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the right balance will depend on individual circumstances including your income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment preferences.
