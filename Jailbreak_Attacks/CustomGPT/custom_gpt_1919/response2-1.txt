The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, meaning they reduce your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may also be made pre-tax, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains on investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account. Consider your risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.).

5. **Age and Retirement Goals**: Your age and when you plan to retire should influence your allocation. Younger individuals might focus more on growth, while those nearing retirement may prioritize preservation of capital.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k) accounts (if you're under 50) and $6,500 for IRAs.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. A common strategy is to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider talking to a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation. They can help assess your investment options, risk tolerance, and overall financial plan.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers tax efficiencies, investment goals, and individual circumstances will yield the best allocation for your money across these accounts.
