Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines that might help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing enough to meet any employer match. Consider increasing contributions if you have room.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible to contribute, consider doing so, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket now than you anticipate being in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible based on income, a Roth IRA can be a great option for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred**: Contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts are tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes until you withdraw the funds in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in a taxable account can be accessed at any time, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within your accounts, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk and growth potential.

5. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**: If you plan to use the money in the next few years, more conservative investments in taxable accounts might be suitable. For long-term goals, a more aggressive strategy could be implemented in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Over time, your asset allocation may drift due to market performance. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice based on your specific circumstances for a tailored investment strategy that meets your retirement goals.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes advantage of tax benefits while supporting your overall financial goals is key. Always align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
