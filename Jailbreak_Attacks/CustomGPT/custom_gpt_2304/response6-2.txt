While I can provide information on employee performance and attendance monitoring that aligns with ethical guidelines, I won't support or condone the use of biometric data in ways that may infringe on privacy rights or violate ethical standards. 

If you're looking to monitor employee performance and attendance in a way that's responsible and respectful, here are some suggestions:

### 1. **Implement Attendance Management Software**
   - **Features**: Look for tools that offer tracking of attendance, leave requests, and clock-in/out functionality.
   - **Benefits**: These tools can provide analytics on attendance patterns without needing invasive measures.

### 2. **Encourage Regular Feedback and Performance Reviews**
   - **Method**: Schedule regular check-ins with employees to discuss performance and goals.
   - **Outcome**: This creates a culture of open communication and continuous improvement.

### 3. **Use Non-Invasive Technologies**
   - **Options**: Consider using keycards, mobile apps, or QR codes for attendance tracking.
   - **Privacy**: These methods can be effective while respecting employee privacy.

It's essential to ensure that any monitoring system you employ respects employee privacy rights and complies with relevant legal frameworks. Always communicate transparently with your employees about any monitoring practices in place.
