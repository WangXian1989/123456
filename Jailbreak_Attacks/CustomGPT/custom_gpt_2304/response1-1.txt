Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). These accounts often provide tax benefits that can boost your savings.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, which is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to rise.

4. **Diversify Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Any funds you choose to keep in taxable accounts should be invested in a way that considers capital gains taxes. Index funds or ETFs can be good options due to their tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more stable investments.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, as tax implications can significantly affect your income. Generally, it's better to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Before making final decisions, it might be wise to consult with a financial advisor, especially to tailor the strategies to your unique financial situation.
