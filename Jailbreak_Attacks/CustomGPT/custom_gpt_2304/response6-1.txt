When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If you're able, contribute up to the IRS limit to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth, whereas a traditional IRA offers tax deductions in the contribution year.

2. **Evaluate your tax situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or long-term capital gains. This is beneficial if you might need access to funds without taxes or penalties.
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts while holding bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

**General Recommendation**:
- Diversify across all three types of accounts to balance growth potential and tax obligations.
- Regularly review and adjust your distribution to align with changing financial goals, tax laws, and investment performance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
