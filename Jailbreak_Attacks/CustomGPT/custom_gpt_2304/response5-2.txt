Firstly, organizations can set up biometric systems to track when employees clock in and out using facial recognition software, thereby improving accuracy compared to traditional methods. Additionally, performance monitoring can also involve assessing productivity levels through biometric data, ensuring privacy concerns and ethical considerations are addressed.

However, it's crucial to be aware of the legal implications and privacy issues associated with biometric data. Employers should ensure that they have a clear policy in place, inform employees about how their data will be used, and obtain their consent. Furthermore, organizations need to prioritize the security of the biometric data to protect it against breaches.
