When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Generally, it's wise to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts, due to the tax benefits they provide.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax treatment.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later on.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you can access funds without penalties, but youâ€™ll pay capital gains tax on any profit when you sell investments.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Think about how you plan to invest. A longer time horizon generally allows for more risk-taking. High-growth investments might be better suited to tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can greatly impact the best strategy for you, so consider discussing your plans with a financial professional for tailored advice.

It's also important to revisit your strategy periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
