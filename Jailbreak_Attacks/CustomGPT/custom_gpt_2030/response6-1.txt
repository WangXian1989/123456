When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount, especially if it's a Roth IRA, where your money can grow tax-free if you meet the withdrawal conditions.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (like buying a house) since withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure you have a mix of investments across all accounts to balance risk and return based on your timeline and risk tolerance.

3. **Tax Implications and Withdrawals:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth; a traditional IRA offers upfront tax deductions. Just strategize around when you expect to withdraw (early vs. retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable, impacting year-to-year financial planning.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and aligning your strategy with your financial goals, you can optimize your investment distribution effectively. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
