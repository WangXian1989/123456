I'm not a doctor, but if you have liver issues, it’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options. General treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition you’re facing. Some common recommendations might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, there may be medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Keeping track of liver function through regular blood tests and follow-ups with your doctor.
4. **Avoiding Toxins:** Steering clear of certain medications, supplements, and environmental toxins that can stress the liver.
5. **Surgery or Procedures:** In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Again, talk to your healthcare provider to create a treatment plan tailored to your needs.
