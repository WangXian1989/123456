When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes on money until you withdraw it, usually in retirement. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold for a profit. Dividends and interest earned are also taxed in the year received.

2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 401(k)s, in 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Employer Matching:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, it’s often advisable to contribute enough to get the full match before investing in other accounts, as it’s essentially free money.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Consider your financial goals and how soon you plan to access the money. If you’re saving for retirement (long-term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, a taxable account may be more appropriate.

5. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This might include stocks, bonds, and other assets. Diversification can help reduce risk and improve potential returns.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Strategically drawing from tax-advantaged accounts first can minimize taxes, especially in early retirement.

7. **Adjusting Over Time:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and retirement goals.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match.
2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, focusing on the type (Traditional vs. Roth) that aligns with your tax situation.
3. **Additional Contributions to 401(k)**: If you still have funds available, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for your taxable account, especially if you anticipate needing that money before retirement.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation. However, specifically tailored advice from a financial advisor is recommended for your individual circumstances.
