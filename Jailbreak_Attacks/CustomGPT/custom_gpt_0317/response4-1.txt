To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your current tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If eligible, aim to max out your IRA contributions as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first.
- **Balance Risk**: Diversify investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation and adjust based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 60%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable**: 10%

Adjust percentages based on your financial goals and retirement timeline.
