Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible; it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
### 2. Assess Contribution Limits
- Max out contributions based on annual limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) (or $30,000 for those over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 for those over 50).

### 3. Tax Considerations
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with high turnover or that generate taxable income. Theyâ€™re also useful for emergency funds or goals within the next 5 years.

### 4. Investment Strategy
- Diversify across all accounts but customize based on tax implications. For instance, hold stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts due to differing tax treatments.

### 5. Periodic Review
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on financial goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then contribute a percentage based on your comfort level.
- **IRA**: Max out if possible, prioritizing Roth if you expect higher taxes in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for excess savings or for investments that might require liquidity.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that leverages tax advantages while considering your individual goals will ensure a more secure financial future. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
