To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out IRA contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Max out 401(k)**: After contributing to the IRA, increase your contributions to the 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This could involve:
   - Investing in diversified ETFs or index funds for long-term growth.
   - Utilizing tax-loss harvesting strategies to minimize taxes on gains.

4. **Consider Allocation**: Keep your investment strategy aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. A balanced mix might include equities, bonds, and alternative investments tailored to your goals.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on market performance and personal circumstances.

By strategically distributing your money among these accounts, you can optimize tax benefits and enhance your overall investment growth.
