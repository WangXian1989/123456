To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2023, with catch-up contributions if eligible).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Good for high-income years.
   - **IRA:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** May provide tax-deductible contributions; taxes on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax; grow tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax on investment growth and interest income.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for growth-oriented investments to minimize taxes.
   - **Income Generation:** Place income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 4. **Emergency Funds:**
   - Maintain sufficient liquid funds outside these accounts for emergencies, typically 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts but tailor the investments to the account type and its tax implications.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and retirement goals, making adjustments as necessary.

### Example Distribution:
- Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to employer match, then max out IRAs, and finally contribute to taxable accounts.
