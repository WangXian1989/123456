To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred; employer matching can amplify savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Tax advantages based on withdrawal timing; Roth grows tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexibility; capital gains taxed; useful for short-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture the full employer match.
   - This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

### 3. **Utilize Tax Advantages**
   - Max out IRA contributions if you're eligible.
   - Choose Roth if you expect higher taxes in retirement; Traditional if you want immediate tax relief.

### 4. **Balance Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**
   - Allocate more to retirement accounts for long-term goals.
   - Use taxable accounts for near-term needs or specific projects.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts.
   - Adjust based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, tax situations, or goals.

By strategically distributing your assets, you can optimize growth while managing your overall tax liability effectively.
