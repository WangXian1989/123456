I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options often discussed for liver issues. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid saturated fats, sugar, and excessive salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help reduce liver fat and improve overall health.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medication**:
   - Specific medications may be prescribed depending on the liver condition (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoid Alcohol**:
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can help prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and health.

5. **Supplements & Alternatives**:
   - Some may consider supplements like milk thistle, but it's essential to discuss these with a doctor.

6. **Management of Underlying Conditions**:
   - Control other medical conditions (like diabetes or high cholesterol) that can affect liver health.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
