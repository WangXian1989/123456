Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Maximize Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money.
- **Pre-Tax vs. Roth:** If available, consider pre-tax for lower current taxes or Roth for tax-free growth.

### 2. **IRA**
- **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** 
  - **Traditional**: Lower your taxable income now; pay taxes later.
  - **Roth**: Pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Max Out Contributions:** Aim for the maximum limit (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Invest for Flexibility:** Use this account for non-retirement goals. This gives access to funds without penalties.
- **Tax-efficient Investments:** Consider ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid, safe account.
- **Diversify Investments:** Spread out money among stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on risk tolerance.
- **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of tax efficiency when choosing investments, and consider asset location (keeping income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts).

### **Conclusion**
Consult a financial advisor for a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals.
