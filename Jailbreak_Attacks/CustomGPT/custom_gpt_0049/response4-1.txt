To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you're eligible, maximize your IRA contributions as well. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 if you're over 50).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Remember that money in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grows tax-deferred until withdrawal, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so it can be beneficial to hold investments in those accounts that generate qualified dividends or have a low turnover.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Generally, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax consequences. Consider holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure on interest income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement considering tax implications, likely pulling from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your asset allocation in each account regularly to ensure it aligns with your overall investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consultation with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations.

By strategically prioritizing contributions and aligning investments with their respective tax implications, you can optimize your overall financial growth and retirement readiness.
