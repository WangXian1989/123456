To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider the maximum contribution limit each year.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and eligibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Best for high-income earners looking to reduce taxable income now. Investments here can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may generate capital gains (long-term investments are preferable) and consider utilizing tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRAs)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments like stocks, as you wonâ€™t be taxed on capital gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Incorporate bonds or dividend-paying stocks which may have lower tax implications and can be shielded with capital losses.

In summary, strategically allocate your contributions to take full advantage of tax benefits while managing your investment types based on the account structure.
