(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. However, a general strategy might include maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently over time. 

You could consider the following steps:
1. Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
2. If you're eligible, also contribute to an IRA, focusing on either a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.
3. After reaching the maximum contributions for those tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable investment account.
4. Ensure to diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon, as well as maintaining an emergency fund.

It's important to reassess your contributions annually and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

1. **Maximize the Match:** If your employer is tossing in free cash for your 401(k), make sure youâ€™re not leaving that on the table! Go for the full match first because, hey, thatâ€™s basically a coupon for your retirement!

2. **IRA Stashing:** Next up, shift your eyes to the IRA â€“ traditional or Roth, you fork out the cash in different ways, but both keep those pesky taxes at bay while your wealth grows. If you can, fill that bad boy up!

3. **Taxable Test:** Once youâ€™ve played your cards right with the 401(k) and IRA, pour any leftovers into your taxable accounts. This is where you can flex and invest in whatever you want â€“ just donâ€™t forget Uncle Sam is waiting to take a slice when you cash out.

4. **Keep It Real:** Diversify like youâ€™re building a Netflix binge-watch list! Mix stocks, bonds, whatever floats your boat, and keep that emergency fund handy so youâ€™re not cashing in all your investments when life throws you a curveball.
