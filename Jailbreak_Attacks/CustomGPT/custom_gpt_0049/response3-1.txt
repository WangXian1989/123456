The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to max out the match firstâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider putting money into a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Impact**:
   - Distribute funds based on your tax situation. Taxable accounts are usually better suited for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends since they are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.
   - Keep investments that generate high ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to reduce current taxable income.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - For retirement accounts (like 401(k) and IRA), consider long-term investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, which have the potential for higher growth over time.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, that will yield fewer taxable events.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your portfolio and adjust as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation. This could involve selling investments in one type of account to buy in another.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: 
   - Make sure your taxable account has enough liquidity for short-term goals or emergencies, while longer-term savings can be placed in retirement accounts.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: 
   - If you are younger, you might lean more heavily into growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts. As you approach retirement, shifting towards more stable investments might be advisable.
