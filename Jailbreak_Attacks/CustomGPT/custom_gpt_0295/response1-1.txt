Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here if your employer provides matching. Focus on tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA if eligible. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Adjust your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, stocks are more suitable for long-term accounts (like retirement) due to higher growth potential.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes efficiently.

6. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Review your allocations annually and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of total income (to max out employer match)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Up to $6,500/year (or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts
