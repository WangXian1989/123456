Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts wisely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Account**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or can be post-tax (Roth). Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose low-cost index funds or a diversified mix of investments offered in your plan.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to contribute the annual maximum allowed.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often have a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After-tax Savings**: Use for money that you may need before retirement or for specific goals (e.g., buying a house).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) or strategies (like tax-loss harvesting) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Strategies**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts.
   - **Balance Risk and Growth**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.
