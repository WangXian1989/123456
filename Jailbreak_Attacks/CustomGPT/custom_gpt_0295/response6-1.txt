Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA:** Aim to max out your Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, balancing short-term and long-term needs.
   - **Bond Investments:** Generally better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to interest income being taxed as ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Ensure you have enough funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs and emergencies, while keeping long-term growth investments in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Retirement Timeline**
   - If retirement is far off, focus more on growth (stocks in tax-advantaged accounts).
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments (bonds) for stability.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions, particularly if matched.
- **IRA:** Contribute fully based on eligibility (Traditional vs. Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate funds for flexibility, focusing on indexed funds or ETFs to minimize taxes on gains.
