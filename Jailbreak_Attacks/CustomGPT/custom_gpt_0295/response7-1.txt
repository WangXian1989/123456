Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. It's free money!

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This provides tax advantages based on your income and retirement goals.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions, as they offer tax benefits. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Consider placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust the allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.

This balanced approach helps reduce taxes and maximize growth over time.
