Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Retirement Savings:** Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes will apply to any profits realized.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k):** Often suitable for more aggressive investments since taxes are deferred.
   - **IRA:** Similar investment approach, but consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor investments that are tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### 5. **Consider Employer Match**
   - If your employer matches 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocation based on performance, market conditions, and life changes.

### Example Strategy
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**
2. **Contribute to IRA (Roth or Traditional)**
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution based on your specific financial situation and goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
