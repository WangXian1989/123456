When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if offered).
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions can reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - Roth accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)) are funded with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - Check the investment selections in your 401(k); if they're limited or high-cost, you might prefer investing more in your IRA or taxable accounts.
   - Ensure a diversified mix in each account suitable for your risk tolerance.

4. **Take Advantage of Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties. This might be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Consider Future Tax Rates**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, it might make more sense to prioritize Roth contributions. If you think your tax rate will drop, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

6. **Reassess Annually**:
   - Regularly review your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation and assist with ongoing management.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your unique financial landscape.
