(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match since it's essentially free money.
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on the money when you withdraw it in retirement. This can be a good option for high-income earners.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**: If you are younger and have a long time until retirement, consider having a more aggressive investment strategy in your retirement accounts (401k and IRA). If you are closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: For money you may need in the short-to-medium term, or if you want to have more liquidity, a taxable account may be suitable. Keep in mind that capital gains taxes will apply on profits from investments held in these accounts.

Ultimately, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a strategy tailored to your specific situation.

1. **Start with the 401(k)**: If your job offers a match, you better believe you should max that out first. Seriously, it's like free money, and you don't want to leave that on the table!
  
2. **Hit Up Your IRA**: Once you've milked the 401(k) match, consider balancing out with a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. They both offer nice tax benefits, but you've got to know when to pay Uncle Sam. If you want to flex in retirement without the taxman breathing down your neck, a Roth can be sweet.

3. **Keep the Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: These are your playgrounds! You can access them anytime, no penalties. But be ready to deal with taxes on any gains. It's not as cozy as the retirement accounts, but it's freedom with a price! 

4. **Age & Goals Matter**: Young and adventurous? Go aggressive with investments in your 401(k) or IRA! Closer to retirement? Start pulling the reins and think about securing that cash flow.

Donâ€™t forget, everyoneâ€™s situation is unique, so feel free to hit up a financial adviser to nail down whatâ€™s best for you. Remember, itâ€™s your moneyâ€”donâ€™t let it just sit there!
