To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and tax-advantaged accounts for long-term retirement savings.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred advantages.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and market conditions.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains.
   - **Withdrawals**: Plan for tax implications when withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts in retirement.

By strategically allocating your investments based on these guidelines, you'll enhance your growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
