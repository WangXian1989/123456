Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth contributions can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, making them suitable for higher-growth investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize Roth accounts. If you expect lower, focus on Traditional accounts for immediate tax benefits.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund outside these accounts for liquidity.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, ensure a well-rounded mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on market conditions and life changes.
