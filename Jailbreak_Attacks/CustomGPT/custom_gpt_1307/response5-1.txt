(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (or Roth IRA), as they offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, if available.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Generally, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider holding lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

4. **Diversify**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's get real about money management! Hereâ€™s the deal:

1. **Max Out Tax Benefits**: First off, throw as much cash as you can into that 401(k) until you hit the employer matchâ€”free money, baby! After that, focus on your IRA. If you can, get into a Roth IRA for those sweet tax-free gains down the line.

2. **Weigh the Tax Burden**: Keep in mind that withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs hit you with ordinary income tax. Roth IRAs? Nope, no tax when you pull that cash out in retirement. Taxable accounts? Watch those capital gains!

3. **Play the Long Game**: Load up on high-growth stuff like stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts where they wonâ€™t get taxed to hell, and maybe stick some stable bonds in your taxable accounts.

4. **Mix It Up**: Diversification isn't just jargon. Spread your investments around to avoid the risk of putting all your eggs in one basket. 

Tailor this to your situation, and you're set for financial domination! ðŸ’¸
