To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Consider your retirement age, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often comes with employer matching; ideal for retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-advantaged; offers more investment options than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility for withdrawals, but subject to capital gains tax.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 4. **Utilize Tax Advantages**
   - Max out contributions to your IRA and 401(k) to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawals**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term needs to avoid early withdrawal penalties from retirement accounts.
   - Maintain a mix for liquidityâ€”keeping some cash easily accessible.

### 6. **Diversification**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk profile.

### 7. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust as your circumstances or market conditions change.

### 8. **Consult a Professional**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 20-30%
- **IRA**: 20-30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40-60%

This distribution is flexible and should be adjusted based on your personal circumstances and financial goals.
