Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth) or a traditional IRA (for immediate tax deductions), depending on your income and tax bracket.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have money to invest after maxing out your IRA, continue adding to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate interest or short-term capital gains, which are taxed at higher rates. Also, consider investing in tax-efficient index funds or ETFs in this account.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. Plan your contributions with future tax implications in mind.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contribution strategy to adapt to changes in your financial situation or goals.
