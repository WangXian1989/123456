To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types and Tax Implications
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred contributions; grows tax-free until withdrawal. Often has employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax benefits vary; Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes on earnings, but offers flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
   - **401(k) Matching**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. Consider Your Time Horizon
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for savings that you might need in the near future.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, especially if you won’t need those funds for decades.

### 4. Asset Allocation Strategy
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where gains will have the best tax treatment.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to reduce risk.

### 5. Account Rebalancing
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired level of risk, especially after market fluctuations.

### 6. Tax-Loss Harvesting
   - In your taxable accounts, consider realizing losses to offset gains, which can reduce your tax liability.

### 7. Consult a Financial Advisor
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and retirement goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: Max employer match + up to contribution limit.
- **IRA**: Max contribution limit (consider Roth for tax-free withdrawals if eligible).
- **Taxable**: Invest remaining funds based on liquidity needs and goals.

### Final Consideration
- Always keep an emergency fund aside from these investments to cover unexpected expenses.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts takes careful consideration of tax impacts, growth potential, and your financial goals. Adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement plans.
