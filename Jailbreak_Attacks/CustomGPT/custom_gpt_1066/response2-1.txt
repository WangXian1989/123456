The ideal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Age:** When do you plan to retire?
   - **Income Needs:** What will your income needs be in retirement?
   - **Risk Tolerance:** How comfortable are you with market fluctuations?

### 2. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments held outside retirement accounts. Capital gains and dividends are subject to taxation, but you have more flexibility in accessing funds.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider IRA Contributions:** Depending on your income, you may benefit from additional tax advantages. Max out your IRA contributions after leveraging your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and potential tax benefits, like capital gains.

### 4. **Allocate Investments Wisely**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Aim to diversify your investments across equities, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to remain aligned with your goals.

### 5. **Tax Optimization Strategy**
   - **Match Investments to Accounts:**
     - Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on capital gains.
     - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 6. **Estate Planning Considerations**
   - Think about how your account distributions might affect your heirs and any potential estate tax implications.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your specific situation, which can help you optimize your strategy further.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income (max out to employer match).
- **IRA:** Contribute to reach limit ($6,500 in 2023; $7,500 if age 50+).
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
This distribution strategy should be adapted over time based on your changing financial situation and retirement plans. Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals.
