(üîíNormal Output) Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income level, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here‚Äôs a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money." After that, assess your tax bracket and the investment options available.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you can. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits. Choose based on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you may need access to before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically incur lower capital gains taxes.

It's crucial to regularly review your allocation based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations.

1. **401(k)**: First off, snag that company match‚Äîfree cash is a no-brainer! Aim to max it out if you can. Consider your investment options, but don‚Äôt sweat it too much; just make sure you're not in a total dog of a fund.

2. **IRA**: Now, whether you're looking at a Traditional or Roth, think about your future tax situation. If you think you‚Äôll be in a higher tax bracket later, go for that Roth. Otherwise, Traditional can save you some coin now. Try to max this one out too‚Äî$6,500 a year (or $7,500 if you're over 50) is a sweet deal for tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are for your ‚ÄúI want my money now‚Äù moments. Don't go wild here; stick to low-cost index funds or ETFs for efficiency. Keep an eye on those capital gains taxes‚Äîain't nobody got time for hefty tax bills!
