To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible now (Traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, and dividends are taxed as ordinary income.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term versus long-term goals. Taxable accounts offer liquidity for short-term needs, while retirement accounts are for long-term growth.

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out IRA contributions next, especially if you have a Roth IRA option.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Allocate a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, considering the tax implications of the investments in each type of account.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your investments periodically based on performance and changing financial goals, keeping an eye on tax implications.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - In retirement, strategize withdrawals to minimize taxes (e.g., withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow).

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20% (max to get employer match)
- **IRA**: 20% (Traditional or Roth)
- **Taxable accounts**: 20% (for liquidity)
- Adjust based on personal circumstances, age, and retirement timeline.

### Consultation with Financial Advisor:
- Always consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique financial situation and goals.

This approach helps maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
