The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds to other accounts.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** contributions are typically tax-advantaged. Traditional accounts allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts** do not offer tax benefits on contributions, but you have more flexibility in accessing your funds and managing investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This should cover 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you are looking for long-term growth, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA.
   - If you need flexibility or are planning for short-term goals, allocate more towards a taxable account.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, aim for a well-diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can evaluate your overall financial picture and recommend a tailored plan.

By considering these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your investment potential.
