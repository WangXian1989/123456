Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, ensure you're contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're in a high tax bracket, contributing to your 401(k) can reduce your taxable income. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you're in a higher tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that could produce taxable income, like stocks that pay qualified dividends, since they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, make sure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Retirement Goals**: Your age and retirement goals play a significant role. If you're younger, you might allocate more to growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement might want to focus on preserving capital.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your distribution should change as your financial situation evolves. Regularly review your investment performance and adjust your contributions and asset allocations as necessary.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
