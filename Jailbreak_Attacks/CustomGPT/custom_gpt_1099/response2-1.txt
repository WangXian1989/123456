When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Then, consider contributing the maximum amount allowed.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), focus on contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your income and retirement goals). The annual contribution limits are typically lower than for a 401(k), but IRAs offer unique tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use **tax-deferred accounts** (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) for investments that you expect to grow substantially over time. This way, you can defer taxes until you withdraw them in retirement, potentially at a lower tax rate.
   - Use **Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k))** if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Diversify your investments within each account type. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, though youâ€™ll need to pay taxes on any capital gains and dividends.

5. **Regularly Revisit and Adjust**: 
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

6. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings set aside for emergencies, which can help you avoid dipping into your retirement accounts prematurely.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient approach to distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
