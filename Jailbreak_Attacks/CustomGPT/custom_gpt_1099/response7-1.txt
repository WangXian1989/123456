The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on various factors including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and long-term financial goals. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs are generally beneficial for younger individuals who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs may be suitable for those looking for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investing:** Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which may offer lower capital gains distributions compared to actively managed funds.

4. **Balance Risk and Growth:** Assess the investment options available in each account type. Generally, place your higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to maximize tax benefits on potential gains, and consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on interest or dividends.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Keep an eye on your tax situation. If you're in a lower tax bracket now but expect to be in a higher one in the future, leaning towards a Roth IRA for future tax-free withdrawals may be wise. Conversely, Traditional IRAs may be more beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

6. **Diversification:** Ensure youâ€™re diversifying your investments across all account types to reduce risk and improve potential returns.

7. **Review Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
