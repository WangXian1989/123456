The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeframe for investment. Here's a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), it's usually advantageous to at least contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After taking full advantage of the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit your retirement savings. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax-deductions on contributions.

3. **Additional Contributions to 401(k):** Once youâ€™ve maxed out the IRA contributions (if you can), return to your 401(k) to increase contributions. In 2023, the limit for employee contributions to a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account for additional savings. This can be useful for funds you may need before retirement, and you have more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Regardless of account type, make sure to diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage risk.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:** Understand the tax implications of each account type. For instance, capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed differently compared to distributions from tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or traditional IRA.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your financial situation and make adjustments as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, goals, or tax laws.
