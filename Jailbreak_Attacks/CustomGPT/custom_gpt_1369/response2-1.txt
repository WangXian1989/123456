The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, future goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to help you find a strategy that works for you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **403(b) Plans**: Similar to 401(k) plans, if you're eligible for a 403(b) plan, consider contributing here too, especially if it has an employer match.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum or the percentage that helps you get the full employer match. If you're self-employed, you might want to consider Solo 401(k) options.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA (if eligible). Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. Here, you can invest in individual stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds. Consider tax-efficient investments that are less likely to generate taxable income, such as index funds.

5. **Strategize Withdrawals**: When planning for retirement, consider which accounts to withdraw from first, depending on your tax situation. It's often beneficial to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs) after exhausting tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments to reduce risk, regardless of the account type. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes to balance growth and stability.

7. **Review and Adjust Annually**: Your financial situation can change, so make it a habit to review your investment distribution at least once a year and adjust as necessary based on your goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. They'll consider your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall financial goals to help you craft the best distribution strategy.
