Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money! Depending on your income, you might want to max out your contribution if possible.
   - **IRA**: After handling your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Taxable accounts raise different tax concerns than tax-advantaged accounts. Consider your current and projected future tax brackets to determine the best account type for additional investments.
   - In general, hold investments that generate higher ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing stocks, which are usually taxed at lower capital gains rates, in taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investment types across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial objectives. 
   - Balance the growth potential of your account types according to your age and retirement timeline.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Fund your taxable accounts with investments you may need access to sooner.

By creating a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals, you can effectively manage your investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
