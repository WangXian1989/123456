I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general advice on liver health. Treatment options for liver problems vary widely depending on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, doctors may prescribe antiviral medications for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can harm the liver.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and imaging tests can help monitor liver health and manage any arising issues.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, like liver cancer or extensive cirrhosis, surgical options may include liver resection or transplantation.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some individuals explore herbal supplements or traditional medicine, but these should always be discussed with a healthcare provider to ensure safety and efficacy.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional to get personalized recommendations based on your specific liver condition.
