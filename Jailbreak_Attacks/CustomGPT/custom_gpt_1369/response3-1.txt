Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating funds to retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

3. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you're in a higher tax bracket, as it reduces your taxable income.

4. **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for younger investors expecting higher future tax rates.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional savings in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across different assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

Remember, the right distribution strategy can optimize your returns and minimize taxes over the long term. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’°
