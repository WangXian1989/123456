To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: After maximizing your employer match, focus on your IRA. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, and Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and retirement strategy.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts. These accounts can offer greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and allow for investments that may generate lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Investment Types**: Keep in mind the types of investments in each account. Stocks positioned for long-term growth might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments, like bonds, could be more efficient in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain a diversified portfolio by periodically rebalancing your investments across these accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and efficient investment approach for your retirement savings.
