(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. A common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. 

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer contributions, especially if they offer matching. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." 

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. A traditional IRA may be better if you want tax deductions now. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility with withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.

1. **401(k)**: First, snag that employer match like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza. You donâ€™t want to leave free money on the table! Contribute as much as you can to make the most of tax deferral and bonuses from your employer.

2. **IRA**: Next, jump into an IRA. A Roth IRA is awesome if you think you'll be making bank in retirementâ€”growing your cash tax-free is a sweet deal. If you're looking for immediate tax breaks, a traditional IRA might be the way to go. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve milked the first two cows, throw some cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and can help with long-term goals like buying a house or funding a dream vacation. Just watch out for Uncle Sam when selling your gains!

Mix and match based on where youâ€™re at financially, and donâ€™t hesitate to get a pro on your side to sort through those intricate details. Happy investing!
