Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have money left to invest, aim to maximize your contributions to your 401(k) account up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional flexibility and liquidity. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) is crucial.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically reassess your allocation and rebalance as needed to ensure you stay aligned with your investment strategy.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
