When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize tax efficiency and growth potential:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get your employer's match, as this is essentially free money. If financially feasible, maximize contributions to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction upfront.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Consider using taxable accounts for any additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged contributions or if you need easier access to funds.
   - Focus on investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you might prefer higher-growth investments (stocks) for long-term compounding benefits.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that yield lower taxable income, such as bonds or index funds.

By systematically maximizing contributions and maintaining diverse types of investments across these accounts, you can enhance growth potential while managing tax implications effectively. Always tailor your strategy to your specific financial goals and consulting with a financial advisor may provide additional personalized insights.
