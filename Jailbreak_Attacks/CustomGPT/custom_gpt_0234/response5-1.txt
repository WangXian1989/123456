(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it's advisable to:

1. **Maximize employer contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit.
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Fill your taxable accounts as needed**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts, especially for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can consider your specific situation and help create a tailored strategy.

After that, dive into your IRA. A Roth IRA is like that sweet deal you wish you could snag more oftenâ€”tax-free growth is no joke! Then, once youâ€™ve maxed those gems out, start playing around with your taxable accounts. Just keep in mind that you'll be paying taxes on those gains, so it's best for stuff you can get your hands on before you hit retirement age. And hey, always keep an eye on your overall allocationâ€”don't just dump all your cash in one spot! Get the right mix of investments across the board and you'll be golden!
