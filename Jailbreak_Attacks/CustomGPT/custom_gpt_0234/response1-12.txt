I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for any liver issues. Treatment options can vary significantly based on the specific liver condition you're dealing with. Common approaches include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgeries if necessary. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and personalized advice from a qualified healthcare provider.
