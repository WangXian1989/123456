When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income in the year contributed. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth with taxed withdrawals, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Income and capital gains from investments in these accounts are taxed in the year they are realized.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. Maxing out employer-matched contributions in your 401(k) can be a priority.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the time frame for when you'll need the funds. Long-term investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term goals might necessitate taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Have a diverse investment strategy across all account types to mitigate risk. Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (like index funds) and consider holding higher-growth or higher-yield investments in tax-deferred accounts to prolong tax benefits.

5. **Withdrawal Planning**:
   - Think about how and when you plan to withdraw money from these accounts. It may be beneficial to delay withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts as long as possible.

As a general strategy, consider prioritizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer matches contributions, then focus on maxing out an IRA, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts as needed. Review your strategy annually and adjust as your financial situation, goals, and tax laws change. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
