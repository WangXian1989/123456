When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Compare Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, meaning you won't pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions might be tax-deductible (Traditional) or withdrawals might be tax-free (Roth). Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed yearly on interest, dividends, and capital gains, but they offer more flexibility and no withdrawal penalties.

3. **Consider Your Investment Timeline**: 
   - For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) & IRA), as they allow your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free. 
   - For shorter-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts for their liquidity.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to allow for tax-free or tax-deferred growth. Consider bonds in taxable accounts for preferential tax treatment.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your contributions annually based on changes in income, tax law, and your retirement goals. 

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your personal financial situation and retirement goals.
