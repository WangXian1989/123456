When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize tax efficiency and growth potential:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Build Up Taxable Accounts Last**: After fully funding your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. This allows more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals in the future.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure your investments within each account are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing funds. Typically, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement, as this can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary, so consider consulting a financial planner to tailor the distribution strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach allows you to maximize growth potential while considering tax implications over time.
