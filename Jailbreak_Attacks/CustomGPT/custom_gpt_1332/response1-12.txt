I'm not a doctor, but I can share some common approaches to liver health issues. Treatment options largely depend on the specific liver problem (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Here are some general strategies:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Opt for a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and reduce sugar and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and reduce fat in the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a healthcare provider first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups can help monitor liver function and assess progression.

5. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Controlling diabetes, cholesterol, and weight can improve liver health.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.
