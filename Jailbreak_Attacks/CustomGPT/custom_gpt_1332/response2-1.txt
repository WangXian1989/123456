To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. Then, aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider this for higher tax brackets.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax advantages, but Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement; consider your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes, such as stocks or ETFs.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Generally, place higher-risk, higher-growth investments here since they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments, as you'll pay taxes on distributions and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation as market conditions change and as you approach retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
