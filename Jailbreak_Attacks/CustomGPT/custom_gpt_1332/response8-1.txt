To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—this is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the short term or for investments that generate lower taxes, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

4. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Choose higher-growth investments like stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.
   - Hold bonds or high-yield investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) to avoid higher tax rates.

5. **Diversify**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to balance risk and return.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations in light of changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that suits your specific financial situation and goals.
