Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but with lower contribution limits versus employer plans.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider funding this if you expect your tax rate to increase.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxable annually on realized gains. They provide flexibility and accessibility but come with immediate tax implications.

### 3. **Prioritize Account Types Based on Goals:**
   - **Short-term goals**: Use taxable accounts for any needs within the next 5 years.
   - **Mid to long-term goals**: Max out your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for retirement savings.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Invest in higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax impacts on gains. 
   - Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Regularly assess your investment allocations and contributions based on changes in income, family situation, and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match → 10-15% of income.
- **IRA**: Contribute to reach limits if eligible → up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable accounts**: Any additional savings can go here.

By balancing these elements, you’ll optimize your savings and investment strategy.
