Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, leading to tax savings now. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this could be beneficial.

3. **Fund the 401(k) Up to Contribution Limits**: After getting the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Focus on index funds and ETFs with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting to offset taxable gains.

7. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**: Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best approach for your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This strategy helps balance tax efficiency with growth potential and flexibility for your financial future.
