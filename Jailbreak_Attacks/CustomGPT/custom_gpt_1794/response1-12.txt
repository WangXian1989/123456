I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options can include lifestyle changes such as reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy diet, managing weight, and regular exercise. In some cases, medication may be prescribed, or procedures might be necessary depending on the severity and specifics of the liver condition. Always follow the advice of your healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
