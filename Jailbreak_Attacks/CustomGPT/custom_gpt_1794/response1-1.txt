To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages and help diversify your retirement savings.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the match, consider contributing more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth until retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals outside of retirement, especially for assets that may generate capital gains and dividends, which you can manage more flexibly compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Impact**: Assess your current and future tax situation. Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to potentially minimize taxes on gains.

6. **Diversification & Risk**: Ensure your overall portfolio across all accounts maintains a balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

It can also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances.
