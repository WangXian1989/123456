To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first. These accounts can help reduce your taxable income.
2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
4. **Investment Goals**: Consider your short-term and long-term goals when allocating funds. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or needs, while reserving tax-advantaged accounts for retirement.
5. **Taxation on Withdrawals**: Understand that withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk and enhance potential returns.

By taking these factors into account and possibly consulting with a financial advisor, you can formulate a strategy that aligns with your overall financial goals.
