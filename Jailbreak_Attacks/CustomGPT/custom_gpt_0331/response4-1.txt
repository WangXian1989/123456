To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Contribute as much as you can up to the annual limit.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for possible tax deductions. Aim to max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment diversification once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on low-turnover investments to minimize taxable events.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Place higher growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for your future withdrawals, aiming to withdraw from accounts in a tax-efficient manner.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
