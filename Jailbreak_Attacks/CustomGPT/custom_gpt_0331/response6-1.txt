To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim for the annual contribution limit, if possible.
   - **IRA**: Prioritize maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA. Assess your current tax bracket to decide which is more beneficial.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. This allows for more accessible funds without penalties for early withdrawal.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-risk investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral, while keeping more stable investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Annual Review**:
   - Regularly assess your investment strategy and reallocate assets based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

This approach balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and liquidity.
