Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments, as taxes are deferred until withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Target growth as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changes in financial goals.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider tax implications when planning withdrawals in retirement, and strategize which accounts to draw from first.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
