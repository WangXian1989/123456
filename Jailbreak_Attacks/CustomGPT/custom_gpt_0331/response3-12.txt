I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can greatly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and catch any worsening conditions early.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary for conditions like liver tumors or cirrhosis.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be the best option.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and a treatment plan.
