Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free.

3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you can’t contribute to a Roth IRA or have more funds, put additional money in a Traditional IRA for the tax deduction benefits.

4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, redirected additional savings to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for additional liquidity and to access funds without penalties. This is useful for short- to mid-term goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type, especially when planning withdrawals or selling investments in taxable accounts. 

7. **Diversify Investment Choices**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

8. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
