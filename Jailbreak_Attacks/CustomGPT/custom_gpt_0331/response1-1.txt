Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth), as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options. Choose a diversified mix of funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers more flexibility. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk profile.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable events (e.g., stocks for long-term capital gains). This can be ideal for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you set aside enough in a liquid account for emergencies before heavily investing.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re far from retirement, you might emphasize growth assets. As you approach retirement, shift towards more stable investments.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies when applicable.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation at least annually and adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan specific to your needs.
