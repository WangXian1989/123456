Distributing your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing immediate and long-term needs, tax implications, and investment goals. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to capture the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider traditional or Roth IRAs. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) or for short-term needs. Favor long-term capital gains investments (like stocks) to minimize taxes upon selling.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, strategize withdrawals to minimize taxes (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts).
