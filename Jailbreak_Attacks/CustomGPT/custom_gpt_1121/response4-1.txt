To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first. These accounts allow for tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or income, such as index funds or low-yield assets, to minimize tax implications.

2. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and an immediate return on your investment.

3. **Retirement Goals**: 
   - Align your contributions with your retirement timeline and goals. If you’re younger, focus more on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA. If you’re closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more stable investments.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan how withdrawals will occur in retirement. Typically, it’s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize taxes.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes to mitigate risk.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Monitor and rebalance your distributions as market conditions change and as you get closer to retirement age.
