The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income today but taxes will apply when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made after-tax, providing tax-free withdrawals later. Consider your expected future tax rate when choosing between traditional and Roth options.

### 3. **Focus on Growth:**
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like growth stocks or index funds) since you'll pay capital gains tax on withdrawals.
   - Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on those income streams.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Ensure that your overall allocation matches your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Adjust contributions based on market conditions, life changes, and financial goals.

### 5. **Plan for Cash Needs:**
   - Keep an emergency fund outside of these accounts for immediate access to cash. This should be easily accessible and not tied up in long-term investments.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Every financial situation is unique. A professional can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Allocate 15-20% of your income to your 401(k) until you fully benefit from any employer match.
- Contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your IRA (if eligible).
- Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on retaining tax efficiency.
  
### Conclusion
A well-rounded approach that considers your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications will generally yield the best results.
