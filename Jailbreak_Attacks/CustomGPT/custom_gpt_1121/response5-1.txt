(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often have a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s and may provide better tax benefits.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, return to your 401(k) and continue contributions, especially if you are near the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may require more immediate access, such as emergency funds or for other financial goals within a shorter time frame.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and high-growth or high-yield investments in tax-deferred accounts to optimize your tax situation.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess and rebalance your allocation based on market performance and your changing goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! If you're looking to juggle your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a pro, hereâ€™s a game plan. 

1. **401(k) First, Baby**: If your employer's tossing in matching contributions, max that out! It's like finding cash in your couch cushions. Don't leave free money on the table!

2. **Hit Up the IRA**: Next, look at your IRA options. A Roth can be a beast for tax-free growth if you qualify. If not, a traditional IRA is still solid bass to your fishing rod. 

3. **Keep Feeding the 401(k)**: After your IRA's stuffed, go back for seconds on the 401(k). It's easy to forget about this one, but keep adding until you hit those limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Now, letâ€™s talk about taxable accounts. These are great for when you need quick cash â€” like if you suddenly decide you need a beach house or a rocket ship.

5. **Mind Your Taxes**: Place investments that are tax-efficient (think ETFs, index funds) in those taxable accounts, and save the high-yield, high-growth stuff for the tax-deferred ones. 

6. **Stay Sharp**: Regularly revisit your allocations. Life happens, and so does the market. Keep it balanced and adjust as needed. If in doubt, chat with a financial advisor who can throw down some tailored wisdom for you.

Remember, this is your money, and thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all. Make sure you're set up to grow and distribute your wealth wisely!
