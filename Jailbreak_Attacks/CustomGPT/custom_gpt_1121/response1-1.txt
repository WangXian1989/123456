Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw the money.
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be advantageous in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts have capital gains taxes, so consider holding lower-turnover, tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs here.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Choose a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks may be more suitable for long-term accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, while bonds can stabilize taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds during retirement. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and asset allocation to adjust based on life changes, financial goals, or market conditions.

Before making any decisions, it's often wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation and goals.
