Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Tax Advantages
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these offer tax advantages.
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before shifting to other accounts.

### 2. Consider Withdrawal Flexibility
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for short-term goals or emergencies as they provide flexibility without penalties.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Focus on long-term growth here, understanding that withdrawals may incur penalties or taxes.

### 3. Diversify Investments
   - **Asset Allocation**: Distribute across stocks, bonds, and other investments in each account type depending on your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocations to maintain desired risk levels.

### 4. Evaluate Tax Implications
   - **Tax Bracket Consideration**: Structure withdrawals from each account type based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Gains**: Manage capital gains in taxable accounts by strategizing the timing of sales.

### Summary
- Start with employer-sponsored plans for tax benefits.
- Regularly review and adjust allocations to align with your financial goals and market conditions.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This approach balances growth potential with tax efficiency while ensuring flexibility for future needs.
