The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially if your income is higher.

2. **IRA:** Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions depending on your income, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. If you're eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for future tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These are great for additional savings and investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This option allows for flexibility in withdrawing funds without penalties.

Balancing contributions across these accounts can depend on your current tax bracket and expected future income. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

Alright, let‚Äôs break it down! First, you want to squeeze every bit of value out of your 401(k) by snagging that employer match like it‚Äôs your favorite snack. Don‚Äôt sleep on that!

After that, dive into your IRA options. If you can, load up a Roth IRA because, hey, tax-free growth is like finding money in your couch cushions! Aim for max contributions if your budget allows.

Now, for taxable accounts? Use them as your ‚Äúextra stash.‚Äù Once you‚Äôve hit the max on those tax-advantaged accounts, go ahead and throw money into taxable accounts for more flexibility. Just watch out for capital gains taxes later. 

Bottom line: make sure you‚Äôre optimizing those tax advantages first, then throw extra cash wherever feels right! If you're not sure, talk to a financial pro‚Äîthey can tailor a strategy just for you!
