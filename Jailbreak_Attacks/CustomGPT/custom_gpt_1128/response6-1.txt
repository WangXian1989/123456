Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions:** Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you're aiming for retirement savings and tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Balance Your Contributions:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, assess how much you want to allocate to your taxable accounts. 
   - **Consider Your Time Horizon:** Funds you plan to use sooner should be in more liquid and less volatile forms.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Generally, place investments that produce higher taxable income (like bond funds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA), while keeping investments with more favorable capital gains treatment (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and adjust your contributions as necessary. Market fluctuations can change the expected balance across accounts.

### 5. **Know Your Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Planning how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement can influence your contribution strategy. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can maximize tax efficiency.

### Summary:
- Prioritize max contributions to 401(k) and IRA.
- Maintain a balance with taxable accounts based on time horizon and tax efficiency.
- Remember to rebalance and think about your eventual withdrawal strategies.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
