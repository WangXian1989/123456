The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Depending on your tax situation, consider whether to contribute to a traditional (pre-tax) 401(k) or a Roth 401(k) (after-tax).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy.
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them a good choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for maximum tax efficiency.
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

5. **Annual Reviews**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
