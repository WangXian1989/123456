I'm not a doctor, but I can share some common treatment options for liver problems. The best course of action depends on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats can help support liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight if you're overweight can help reduce liver fat.

2. **Medical Treatments**
   - **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat infections.
   - **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and liver function tests can help monitor your liver health.

3. **Alternative Therapies**
   - **Home Remedies**: Some people explore herbal supplements (after consulting with a healthcare provider) believed to support liver function, like milk thistle.
   - **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water aids in maintaining overall health.

For accurate diagnosis and treatment, consulting a healthcare professional is essential.
