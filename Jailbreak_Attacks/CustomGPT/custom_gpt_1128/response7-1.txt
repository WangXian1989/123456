Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous for tax-free withdrawals if you're eligible.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: After securing any employer match and contributing to an IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need to access sooner or to invest in options not available in retirement accounts. Build a diversified portfolio with considerations for capital gains and dividends, which will be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: For taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate fewer taxable events.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Always ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts. 

7. **Review Annually**: Reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
