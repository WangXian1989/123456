Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met. Choose based on whether you prefer tax benefits now or in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes on investments.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategies**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Place riskier investments in your Roth IRA or taxable accounts for potential tax-free growth or long-term capital gains treatment.
   - **Bonds and Stable Investments**: Consider holding bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk profile.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: As market conditions change, periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your intended risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consulting with a professional can be beneficial.

This strategic approach will help optimize your investment benefits and minimize tax liabilities over time.
