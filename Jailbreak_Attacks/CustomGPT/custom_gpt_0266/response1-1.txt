To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This helps reduce your taxable income.
   - Next, contribute to an IRA. If you're eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement. These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts. Use different asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering the varying tax implications across different accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, have a plan for how and when to withdraw from each type of account, optimizing tax efficiency.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
