To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

3. **Fund 401(k)**: After maxing out the IRA contributions, shift focus back to your 401(k) to maximize contributions, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce capital gains, as they can be more tax-efficient. Consider holding assets like stocks, which benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse asset allocation within each account type to manage risk while targeting growth.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep an eye on your liquidity needs, as funds in retirement accounts often have withdrawal penalties before retirement age.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This diversified approach helps optimize taxes and grow your retirement savings effectively.
