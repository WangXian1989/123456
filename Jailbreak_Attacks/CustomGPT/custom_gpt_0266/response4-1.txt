To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions if you can, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deduction benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This can be useful for short-term goals or if youâ€™ve maxed out retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced allocation among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Reassess Annually**: Review your distribution strategy regularly to adjust based on changes in financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

This approach can help you maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
