I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

3. **Monitor Liver Function**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function can help track the condition.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or obesity can help alleviate liver stress.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver failure, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
