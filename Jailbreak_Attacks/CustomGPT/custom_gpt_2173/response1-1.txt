The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**  
   - **Take Advantage of Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions:**  
   - **Tax Advantages:** Determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is better for your situation. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification:** Use IRAs to diversify your investments and possibly choose more aggressive growth options since you wonâ€™t need to access these funds in the short term.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**  
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals. Consider maintaining an emergency fund and other short-term savings in taxable accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of the tax implications when investing in taxable accounts. Holding investments long-term can minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Allocation Strategy:**  
   - **Balance Risk and Return:** Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market performance.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**  
   - It may be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial advisor who can consider your specific circumstances and help develop a tailored investment strategy.

Always consider your overall financial situation, retirement goals, and any potential tax implications before making decisions on how to allocate your money.
