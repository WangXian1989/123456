The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**  
   If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point for retirement savings.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional Accounts:**  
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, and youâ€™ll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. This might be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is a good option if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation:**  
   Your investment strategy should consider the risk tolerance and timeline for each account. For retirement accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, you might opt for a more aggressive portfolio with stocks, since you have years before you need to access these funds. In contrast, taxable accounts might lean toward more conservative investments due to potential capital gains taxes.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**  
   Place tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts. For example, bonds and REITs that generate regular income may be better suited for tax-deferred accounts, while stock funds that appreciate in value can be held in taxable accounts for favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

5. **Emergency Savings:**  
   Ensure that you have sufficient cash reserves outside of your retirement accounts for emergencies. Consider three to six months' worth of living expenses in a liquid savings account.

6. **Debt Management:**  
   If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before allocating large sums to your retirement accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**  
   If you're uncertain about the best allocation for your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By understanding these factors and tailoring your strategy to your personal circumstances, you can effectively distribute your money amongst your retirement and taxable accounts to meet your financial goals.
