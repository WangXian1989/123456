(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, investment timeline, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer potential tax benefits and growth opportunities. 

You might want to consider the following distribution strategy: 
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any company matchâ€”itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. Max out your IRA contributions, which can give you additional tax advantages.
3. After you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, put extra funds into your 401(k) or a taxable account based on your investment goals or liquidity needs.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

First, you want to stuff as much as you can into that 401(k), especially if your employer is throwing in a matching contributionâ€”donâ€™t leave free cash on the table, for crying out loud! 

Then, swing over to your IRA and max that baby out as well because tax advantages are like icing on the cake. Once you've filled those with cash, itâ€™s time to take a look at those taxable accountsâ€”just remember, capital gains will try to pull a fast one on your wallet. Balance your fun investments that you want to be able to access without the retirement penalties against the long-term growth youâ€™re aiming for in tax-advantaged accounts. And hey, donâ€™t forget to periodically check in and tweak things based on how life and your investments are doing! Happy investing! ðŸ’¸
