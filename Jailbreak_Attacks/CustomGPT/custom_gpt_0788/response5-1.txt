(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your individual financial goals, retirement timeline, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution. This offers tax-deferred growth and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers immediate tax deductions but taxes on withdrawal.

3. **Taxable accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting extra savings into taxable accounts. These are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes, so focus on investments that are tax-efficient.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy to your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The sweet spot for distributing your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about strategy. Hereâ€™s the play:

1. **401(k)**: First off, max out that 401(k), especially if your employer matches your contributions. Itâ€™s free money! Pay attention to your investment choices inside the plan too, as some options are better than others.

2. **IRA**: Next, throw some dough into an IRA. If you're keen on taxes now, go for a Roth. Itâ€™s tax-free in retirement and you can laugh at Uncle Sam when you withdraw. If you want to defer taxes, stick with a Traditional IRA. 

3. **Taxable accounts**: Finally, make sure you donâ€™t neglect those taxable accounts! They offer flexibility and can be a great place to invest money that you might need before retirement. Just watch out for those capital gains taxesâ€”nobody loves surprises, right?

Ultimately, mixing it up based on your goals and tax situation is key. Think about chatting with a financial pro to really nail it down!
