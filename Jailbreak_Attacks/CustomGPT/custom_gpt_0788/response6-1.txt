To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a company match.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Contributions for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for short- to mid-term goals. This gives you flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Asset Location Strategies**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Investment Choices**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to manage risk.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

By leveraging the tax advantages of each account type while maintaining a diversified portfolio, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and flexibility.
