Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) to at least the employer match level. Consider the planâ€™s fees and investment options.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income for the year you contribute.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline, diversifying across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation, especially as you approach retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide tailored advice based on your individual financial situation and goals.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and strategically placing assets based on tax implications, you can optimize your investment portfolio for growth and retirement readiness.
