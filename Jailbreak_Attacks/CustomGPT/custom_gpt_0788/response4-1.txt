Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, and investment growth isn't taxed until withdrawal. Prioritize maxing out these accounts, especially if your employer offers a match on the 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can generate capital gains and dividends, which are taxed in the year they are received. Consider placing investments that generate high dividends or frequent trading in tax-deferred accounts to minimize immediate tax implications.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Consider your expected retirement age and lifestyle. If you plan on early retirement, you might want to focus on maximizing tax-deferred accounts, as they carry penalties for early withdrawals.

3. **Roth Accounts**:
   - If youâ€™re eligible, consider Roth IRAs for tax-free growth. Contributions are made with after-tax money, but qualified withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors might focus on growth-oriented investments in their retirement accounts (which can have higher risk tolerance) while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts to avoid penalties for early access or to access funds if needed.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Across all accounts, ensure your investments are diversified. This might mean holding different asset classes or different types of investments (stocks, bonds, real estate).

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review your goals and the performance of your investments. Adjust your contributions to different accounts as your financial situation and goals evolve.

A common strategy is to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, fully fund the IRA (if eligible), and then allocate any remaining funds based on your investment goals and tax strategies.
