When considering the best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think about your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t provide tax advantages but offer flexibility. Capital gains are taxed, but long-term gains have a lower rate. Consider placing assets with high growth potential here.

3. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. Each account type can hold different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and reward.

4. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit card debt), it may be wise to pay that down before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an accessible emergency fund before locking too much in retirement accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your planned withdrawal strategy in retirement. Typically, you withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in income, expenses, market performance, and life circumstances.
