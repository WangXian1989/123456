Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider for optimal allocation:

### General Guidelines

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out your contributions if possible, especially if you can get the full employer match.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age, and to achieve specific financial goals (like buying a home or funding education).

### Consider Your Tax Situation

- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. This is advantageous for long-term growth.
- **Tax-Free Growth**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These may be subject to capital gains taxes, but they provide flexibility and can be used for short- to medium-term goals.

### Age and Risk Tolerance

- Younger investors might lean more towards aggressive investment strategies in tax-advantaged accounts for growth potential.
- As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### Regular Review and Rebalance

- Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
- Rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

### Seek Professional Advice

- Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your unique situation and goals.

By employing these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, minimizing taxes and maximizing growth potential over time.
