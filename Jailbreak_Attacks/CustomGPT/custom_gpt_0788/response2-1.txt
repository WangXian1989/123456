Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan with potential for matching contributions. Offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax benefits and can be a traditional or Roth IRA. Tax treatment varies.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends, offering greater flexibility but less tax efficiency.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Short-term vs. long-term needs.
   - Risk tolerance and investment preferences.

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). Consider maximizing contributions if your employer allows.
   - **IRA:** Once you've optimized your 401(k), fund an IRA to benefit from tax advantages. If eligible, a Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditionally taxed vs. tax-free growth:** Balance contributions between traditional tax-deferred accounts and Roth accounts based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Withdrawals:** Plan for taxes on distributions from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs.

### 5. **Maintain Diversification:**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.
   - Evaluate the overall asset allocation across all accounts.

### 6. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.
   - Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term holdings to minimize capital gains taxes).

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Monitor your investment performance and reallocate as needed based on market changes and life events.
   - Adjust contributions based on income changes, tax laws, or financial goals.

### Summary:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to capture employer matches, then fund an IRA (Roth if eligible), and finally invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Always consider your tax situation, investment goals, and adjust your strategy as your financial situation evolves.
