   - Diet: Eating a balanced diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - Alcohol: Avoiding alcohol to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Specific drugs to treat conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.
