Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. The 401(k) offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide easier access to funds without penalties and offer capital gains treatment, which can be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
