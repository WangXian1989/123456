I'm not a doctor, but managing liver issues typically involves a few key approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol, saturated fats, and processed sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging.

4. **Avoid Toxins**: Limit exposure to chemicals and toxins that can harm the liver.

5. **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight is essential, especially if you have fatty liver disease.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
