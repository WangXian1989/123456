To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, if available. Aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower tax rates.

3. **Investment Diversification:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify across different asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on higher returns.

Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy to align with changes in your financial situation and goals.
