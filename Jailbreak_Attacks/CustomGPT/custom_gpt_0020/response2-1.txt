To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions (if applicable).

3. **Return Focus**: Allocate remaining funds to your 401(k) and IRA based on their investment options and fees. Favor lower-cost index funds or ETFs for long-term growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and municipal bonds to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for future withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications of each account type.

This balanced approach helps you take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring diversified investments. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
