I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help track liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver tumors or cirrhosis, surgical intervention may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be the only option.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
