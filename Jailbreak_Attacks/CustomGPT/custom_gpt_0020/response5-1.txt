Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility) after the 401(k) match. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your returns.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement age, as withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can incur penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Adjust Based on Income Needs**: If you're approaching retirement and need income, shift investments to taxable accounts that can provide dividends or interest.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing personal circumstances.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
