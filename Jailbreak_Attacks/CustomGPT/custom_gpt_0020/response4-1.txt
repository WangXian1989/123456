Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (traditional or Roth), you can either defer taxes or enjoy tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow without tax until sold but are subject to capital gains tax.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first before putting significant amounts into taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you’re diversifying investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawal strategies based on tax implications. Typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Consider Your Time Frame**: If you're closer to retirement, lean more towards income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
