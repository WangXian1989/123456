Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Max out contributions (up to the IRS limit) if you're not reaching the match. 
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider opening a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Investments here can generate capital gains, dividends, and interest that are taxed differently.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when to withdraw funds for retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Before making decisions, consider consulting with a financial advisor to get personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
