Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income level, you may want to choose between the two based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Balance your contributions between tax-deferred (401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts. This strategy helps manage your tax liability in retirement by providing flexibility in withdrawing funds.

4. **Fill Your Taxable Accounts Last**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing any additional savings in taxable brokerage accounts. These accounts do not have contribution limits, and you can withdraw funds without penalty at any time, although you may incur capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your investment choices within each account according to when you plan to access the funds and your risk tolerance. Longer time horizons can typically afford to take on more risk, while shorter timelines may require more conservative investments.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investment strategy, especially with taxable accounts. Favoring long-term investments can help minimize capital gains taxes compared to frequent trading.

7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Life circumstances change, so itâ€™s crucial to revisit your allocation periodically and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, financial goals, and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
