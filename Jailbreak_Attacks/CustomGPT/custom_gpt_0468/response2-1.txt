Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and may offer employer matching. Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offers flexibility to access funds without penalties but incurs capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Needs:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.
   - **Short-term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need within the next few years.
   - **Diverse Investments:** Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out your IRA contributions if eligible.
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider directing additional funds to taxable accounts.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Contribute to tax-deferred accounts first for maximum tax efficiency.
   - Use IRAs for tax-free growth (Roth) or tax deduction (Traditional).
   - Hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Allocate investments differently across accounts. For instance, consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in Roth IRAs for tax-free growth and safer investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If uncertain, consider getting personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute up to employer match.
- **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA:** Maximize annual contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for additional investing after tax-advantaged accounts are maximized.

The optimal allocation can vary for each individual, so consider your specific financial situation before making decisions.
