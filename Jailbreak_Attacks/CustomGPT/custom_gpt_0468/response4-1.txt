The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment timeline, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to capture the full match first. This is essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k) contribution, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Money here can be used for short-term goals or emergencies. Consider keeping investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.
   - Emphasize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains distributions.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, focus more on taxable accounts where you can access your funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) according to your risk tolerance. Spread out your investments within each account type too.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

6. **Consider Future Tax Rates:**
   - Think about where you expect your income to be in the future. If you believe your tax rate will be higher when you retire, favor Roth accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

In summary, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, consider your tax implications and investment strategy, and regularly review your allocations.
