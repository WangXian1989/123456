Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are a few general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions based on contributions.
  
2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - Contributions to a **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** are often tax-deductible, meaning you won't pay taxes on that income until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. It's generally wise to hold investments with high potential for appreciation in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your comfort level with risk. Generally, younger investors might lean towards stock investments for growth, while older investors may prefer bonds for stability.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversification is key. Ensure a balance of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts instead of concentrating certain assets in one type of account.

5. **Flexibility and Access**:
   - Consider your need for liquidity. Taxable accounts can be liquidated without penalties, whereas accessing 401(k) and IRA funds before retirement age typically incurs penalties and taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice that considers your entire financial picture, helping you optimize your investments per your situation.

Creating a strategic plan based on these considerations will help you efficiently distribute your money among your accounts while keeping your goals in sight.
