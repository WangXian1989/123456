Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax bracket, and investment goals. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**

- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.
- **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two depends on whether you prefer to pay taxes now (Roth) or later (traditional). Max out contributions if possible.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**

- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate frequent income (like bonds) or short-term investments. Taxable accounts can also offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but they might be subjected to higher taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**

- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your comfort with risk. Younger individuals might invest more in stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds or stable investments to preserve capital.

### 4. **Balance Contributions Based on Goals**

- If you have short-term goals (like buying a house or funding education), taxable accounts might be your focus.
- For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for maximum growth potential.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**

- Periodically review your portfolio and make adjustments based on life changes (new job, family, retirement) and market conditions.

### Example Strategy

- **Aggressive (age < 40)**: Max out 401(k) to the match, fully fund Roth IRA, then invest in a taxable account.
- **Moderate (age 40-60)**: Contribute to 401(k) and IRA based on tax implications, then use taxable accounts for additional savings.
- **Conservative (age > 60)**: Focus on preserving capital in IRAs and taxable accounts with lower risk investments.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
