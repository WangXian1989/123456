When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors to maximize your benefits:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Employer matching contributions can also enhance this account's value.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on capital gains and dividends, but they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re investing for the long term (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For short-term goals or emergencies, keep cash or liquid investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you are aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, in 2023, the 401(k) has a limit of $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and IRAs have a limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### Suggested Strategy:

- **Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.**
- **Contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional depending on your income and tax situation) after your 401(k) if you have additional funds.**
- **Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement or for diversifying your portfolio.**

By balancing contributions based on tax implications, investment goals, and limits, you can create an effective distribution strategy that aligns with your financial objectives.
