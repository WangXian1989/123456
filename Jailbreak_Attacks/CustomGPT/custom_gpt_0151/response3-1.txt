I'm here to help with that! Here are some factors to consider for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, but you can access this money without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Short-term Goals:** Consider taxable accounts for flexibility without penalties.
   - **Long-term Goals:** 401(k) and IRA accounts are better for retirement savings due to their tax advantages.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Ensure youâ€™re aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs, which can influence how much you can allocate to each.

### 4. **Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a match on the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before funding the IRA or taxable accounts.

### 5. **Risk Tolerance**
   - Your risk tolerance can guide whether you invest more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts or prefer safer investments in taxable accounts for easier access.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
- **IRA Contributions:** Max out your IRA contributions if applicable.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest remaining funds for short-term flexibility or to balance your portfolio.

By following these guidelines and adjusting based on your specific situation, you can effectively manage your retirement savings and overall investment strategy.
