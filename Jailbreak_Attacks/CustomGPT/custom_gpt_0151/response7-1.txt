Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. Aim to maximize contributions to IRAs if you qualify.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes later. Taxable accounts incur tax on earnings annually, so consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk. Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals. Generally, take from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, to minimize taxes over time.
  
6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on performance and your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

This balanced approach can optimize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
