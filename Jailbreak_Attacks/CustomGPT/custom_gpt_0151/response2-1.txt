To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, focusing on maximizing that contribution. For 2024, the limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if 50+).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold bonds or high-yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a high-yield savings account before investing aggressively.

7. **Review & Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
