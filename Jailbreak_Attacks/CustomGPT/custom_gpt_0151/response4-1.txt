To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically pre-tax contributions; lowers your taxable income now. Consider maxing out employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offers flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement): Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For short-term goals: Use taxable accounts for accessibility.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) (up to $22,500 for 2024, plus catch-up contributions if applicable).
   - Contribute to IRA (up to $6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes in each account to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications based on when you'll withdraw funds, especially from taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on market performance and changes in financial goals.

For a personalized strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor.
