Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. It's effectively free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** The IRS has annual contribution limits; ensure you're within those.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Choose based on your current tax bracket versus expected tax bracket at retirement. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.
   - **Maximize Annual Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals:** For money needed within the next few years, taxable accounts might be more accessible.
   - **Invest Tax-Efficiently:** Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

4. **General Guidelines:**
   - **Emergency Fund First:** Make sure you have an emergency fund before aggressive investing.
   - **Diversify Investments:** Allocate across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations as needed based on market conditions or life changes.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized strategies can help you align your investments with your long-term goals. 

Considerations on age, employment status, and individual goals are also crucial in deciding the right mix.
