To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategic steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Diversify Asset Allocation:**
   - **Stocks in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Higher potential growth; tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Interest taxed as ordinary income; manage tax implications.

3. **Consider Liquidity Needs:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Maintain an emergency fund or access for short-term goals.
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Designed for long-term growth; avoid early withdrawals.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Determine your current and expected future tax rates to strategize contributions accordingly.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and life changes.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-balanced investment strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing tax impacts.
