I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight loss, and abstaining from alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Antiviral drugs (for hepatitis) or corticosteroids (for autoimmune liver diseases).
3. **Supplements**: Certain vitamins and herbs may support liver health.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep track of liver function tests with your healthcare provider.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan.
