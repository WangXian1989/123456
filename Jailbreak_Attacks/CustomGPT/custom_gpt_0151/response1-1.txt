To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employers' Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes; useful for short-term investments.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with your 401(k) to capture the match.
   - If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accountsâ€”stocks in growth accounts, bonds for stability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you'll withdraw from each account during retirement to minimize taxes and maximize longevity.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation can be beneficial as well.
