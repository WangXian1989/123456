I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antiviral Medications**: For viral hepatitis (like Hepatitis B or C).
   - **Liver Support Supplements**: Some may promote liver health but consult a doctor.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - **Regular Check-ups**: Monitor liver function tests and symptoms.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some people find benefit in herbal treatments, though these should be approached with caution and evaluated for safety.
