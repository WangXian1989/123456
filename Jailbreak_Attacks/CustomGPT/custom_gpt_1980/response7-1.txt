Determining the best way to distribute your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Account**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax or after-tax (Roth), reducing your taxable income or allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial as withdrawals are tax-free. If you want to save on taxes now, consider a Traditional IRA.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be sure you’re aware of annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and are useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before allocation.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs).
   - **Age-Based Allocation**: As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting more towards safer assets like bonds.

### Suggested Order of Contribution
1. **401(k) (to the employer match)**
2. **IRA (max out if possible)**
3. **Additional 401(k) contributions if applicable**
4. **Taxable accounts for extra flexibility**

### Periodic Review
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on life changes, financial goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
