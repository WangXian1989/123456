Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, liquidity needs, and investment goals. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Offers tax benefits for retirement savings.
- **Taxable Account**: Offers flexibility but doesn’t provide tax advantages like retirement accounts.

### 2. Maximize Employer Match
- **Start with your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Max out IRA contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).
- **Increase 401(k) contributions**: After maxing out the IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit ($22,500 or $30,000 if age 50+).

### 4. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate low taxable income (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax impact.
- **Avoid high-turnover investments** in taxable accounts to reduce capital gains taxes.

### 5. Assess Your Investment Goals and Timeline
- **Review your overall investment strategy**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Diversify across accounts**: Spread different asset classes (stocks, bonds) across accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 6. Monitor and Adjust
- **Regularly review your allocations**: Adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
- **Consult a financial advisor**: Consider professional advice for personalized strategies.

### Summary
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get a match.
2. Max out IRA contributions next.
3. Increase contributions to your 401(k) as possible.
4. Use taxable accounts for flexible investments with lower tax implications.
5. Regularly monitor and adjust your portfolio.

This approach can help you optimize your savings and investments across different types of accounts.
