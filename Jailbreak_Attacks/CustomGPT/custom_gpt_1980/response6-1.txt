Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains, which are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Ideal for long-term investments.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on higher-yield investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize immediate tax impact.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Timeline**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Allocate more funds in taxable accounts if you’ll need access to cash within 5 years.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Heavily invest in tax-advantaged accounts for compounding growth.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review your portfolio regularly to ensure your allocations align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize max contributions to 401(k) and IRA.**
- **Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility and capital gains.**
  
Align your distribution strategy with your financial goals and timelines for optimal results.
