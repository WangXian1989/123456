I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you consult a healthcare professional for any liver-related issues. They can provide you with the best treatment options based on your specific condition. General treatment measures may include a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing underlying conditions, but it's essential to get personalized advice. Please take care of your health!
