I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general suggestions that may be considered for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health. Reducing alcohol intake and maintaining a healthy weight are also important.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver problem, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests can help track the condition's progression and treatment effectiveness.

4. **Potential Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver biopsy or even liver transplantation might be necessary.

Please consult a healthcare professional for the best treatment options suited to your specific condition.
