When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to keep in mind. Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year they're made. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. If there's an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Consider maxing out contributions to these accounts for tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Although these accounts don’t provide tax advantages, they're more flexible for withdrawals and can be used for short-term goals. Invest for long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Align your investment choices with your goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for each account. Consider more aggressive investments in accounts with long-term growth, like a 401(k) or IRA, while using more conservative investments in taxable accounts to mitigate immediate tax implications.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Consider placing investments with high tax burdens (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs, 401(k)) and investments with lower tax burdens (like stocks) in taxable accounts. This can help optimize your overall tax situation.

5. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically in a high-yield savings account, to cover 3-6 months of expenses. This helps you avoid withdrawals from retirement accounts.

6. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Consider your financial goals (e.g., retirement age, desired lifestyle) and how each account fits into your overall strategy.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) until you hit the employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, contribute to your IRA (preferably a Roth, if eligible).
3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts, focusing on long-term investments to manage tax liability.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, markets, and personal goals.

### Consult with a Professional:
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and circumstances. 

This approach helps create a balanced strategy that leverages tax benefits while positioning you for long-term financial success.
