Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Once employer match is maxed out, consider maximizing your IRA contributions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **traditional IRA** contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made post-tax but grow tax-free, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - If you're younger and a long way from retirement, consider a more aggressive investment strategy in your 401(k) and IRAs.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you’re diversifying within each account to mitigate risks. Different accounts may have different investment options.

5. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically and adjust contributions based on your changing income, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have savings outside these accounts for emergencies to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts, which can incur penalties.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment in these accounts for long-term growth.
