Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing the maximum to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments like stocks.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to within five years.

### 3. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments long enough to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Plan for this in your tax strategy.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Spread different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across your accounts to reduce risk and optimize returns.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust as needed based on performance and changing goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider working with a financial planner.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 40% of total investments
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

Adjust based on your specific priorities and timelines.
