Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions if you're allowed.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in this account for money you might need in the short term or for goals outside of retirement. Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains tax, so consider using tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-free or tax-deferred. More conservative investments (like bonds) can go in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review your distribution strategy periodically. As your income, expenses, and goals change, you may need to adjust your contributions.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts, ensuring youâ€™re not overly concentrated in any one investment type.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide customized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
