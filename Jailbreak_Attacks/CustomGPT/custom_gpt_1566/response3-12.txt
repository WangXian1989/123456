I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit saturated fats and sugar.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare professional to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Stay away from harmful substances and medications that can affect the liver.

5. **Exercise**: 
   - Regular physical activity to help manage weight and improve overall health.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
