To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. The traditional 401(k) and IRA offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for the 401(k) (plus $7,500 catch-up if over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 catch-up if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable brokerage accounts. Use these accounts for investments that may have favorable capital gains treatment or are less time-sensitive.

4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Funds**: Choose tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider holding bonds or other interest-generating securities in tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher tax rates.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in tax laws, investment goals, and retirement timeline.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
