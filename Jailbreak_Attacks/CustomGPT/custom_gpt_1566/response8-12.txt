I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver problems and their treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial, especially for liver diseases like hepatitis or cirrhosis.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, various medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies:**
