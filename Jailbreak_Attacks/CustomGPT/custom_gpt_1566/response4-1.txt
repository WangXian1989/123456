To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

1. **Maximize Employer Benefits**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider maxing it out if possible. Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income now, while Roth 401(k) contributions grow tax-free.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) employer match, contribute to an IRA. Traditional contributions may offer immediate tax benefits, while Roth contributions provide tax-free growth.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once your 401(k) and IRA contributions are maximized, invest in taxable accounts. This provides access to funds without penalties, plus it offers tax diversification, especially if you focus on tax-efficient investments.

4. **Asset Allocation and Investment Choices**: Choose investments based on your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon while maintaining a diversified portfolio across all accounts.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review your contributions and adjust according to changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're uncertain, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique circumstances.

This strategy provides a balanced approach, leveraging tax advantages while maintaining flexibility.
