1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit fatty foods.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Medications to decrease inflammation and slow disease progression.
   - Diuretics for fluid retention.

3. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

Itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized plan tailored to your specific needs.
