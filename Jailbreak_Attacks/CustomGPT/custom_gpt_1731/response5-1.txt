Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a few considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### General Guidelines for Distribution

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**:
     - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match.
     - For the 2023 tax year, the maximum contribution is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're aged 50 and over).
   - **IRA**:
     - Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income level and tax situation. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're aged 50 or over).

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing employer match in your 401(k), consider putting additional funds into your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - If you've fully funded these accounts, allocate excess funds to a taxable account, which provides flexibility in accessing your money.

3. **Consider your Tax Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): These accounts help defer taxes until retirement, allowing your investments to grow tax-free until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Growth** (Roth IRA): Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for investments that may be needed before retirement age or to manage capital gains distributions effectively. 

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals, adjusting allocations according to the tax implications associated with each account type.

### Example Distribution Strategy

| Account Type     | Contribution Priority | Total Allocation % | Notes                             |
|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 401(k)           | 1st (up to match)     | 20% - 30%         | Prioritize employer match.       |
| Traditional IRA  | 2nd (if eligible)     | 10% - 20%         | Tax-deferred growth.             |
| Roth IRA         | 3rd (if eligible)     | 10% - 20%         | Consider your future tax rate.   |
| Taxable Account   | 4th                   | 30% - 50%         | Flexible access; manage taxes.   |

### Tips for Ongoing Management
- **Reassess Allocations Regularly**: Life changes and market conditions may necessitate adjustments.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

This approach balances between maximizing tax benefits and providing liquidity. Make sure to align decisions with your long-term financial goals.
