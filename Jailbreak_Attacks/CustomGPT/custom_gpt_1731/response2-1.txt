When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here's a structured approach to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals** üéØ
   - Determine your short-term and long-term goals.
   - Consider factors like retirement, purchasing a home, or funding education.

### 2. **Understand Account Types** üè¶
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan, often with matching contributions. Great for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, offering tax advantages. Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility but subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation** üßæ
   - Contributions to traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts reduce taxable income, while Roth contributions do not upfront but allow tax-free withdrawals later.
   - Gain clarity on your current tax bracket and future expectations.

### 4. **Distributing Your Funds** üìä
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Make sure to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any company match.
   - **Prioritize Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before focusing heavily on these accounts.
   - **Next, Contribute to an IRA**: Once you maximize your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA (both traditional and/or Roth) as they offer good tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after funding your retirement accounts, taxable accounts can provide liquidity and diversification.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly** üîÑ
   - Monitor your investments and adjust as your financial situation changes.
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
| Account Type        | Annual Contribution (%) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 401(k)              | 15%                     |
| IRA (Traditional/Roth) | 10%                  |
| Taxable Accounts     | 5%                      |

### Conclusion:
Your financial distribution strategy should be personalized based on your circumstances. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
