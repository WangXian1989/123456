Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here‚Äôs a general guideline to help you make informed decisions:

### **1. Understand Each Account Type:**

- **401(k):**
  - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
  - **Employer Match:** Take advantage of any employer match as it's essentially free money.
  - **Withdrawal Restrictions:** Limited access before retirement age without penalties.

- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
  - **Types:** Traditional vs. Roth IRA. Traditional is tax-deductible; Roth is tax-free upon qualified withdrawals.
  - **Contribution Limits:** Lower than 401(k) limits. Keep an eye on income restrictions for Roth contributions.
  
- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - **Flexibility:** No limits on contributions or early withdrawals.
  - **Tax Implications:** Capital gains tax when selling investments for a profit.

### **2. Suggested Distribution Strategy:**
  
- **Prioritize Contributions:**
  1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: At least contribute enough to get the full match.
  2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, especially if you can get a tax deduction or tax-free growth.
  3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If budget allows, contribute the max to your 401(k) to take advantage of the leading tax benefits.
  4. **Use Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for any additional funds, especially for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.

### **3. Consider Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
  
- Use a mix of stocks and bonds suitable for your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- Generally, younger investors can afford more risks (stocks) in their 401(k) and IRA investments, while older individuals may prefer fixed income or conservative investments as they approach retirement.

### **4. Revisit and Adjust:**

- Review your allocation regularly and adjust based on changes in your goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

### **Example Allocation Based on Age:**

| Age Range | 401(k) | IRA | Taxable |
|-----------|--------|-----|---------|
| 20s-30s   | 60%    | 20% | 20%     |
| 40s-50s   | 50%    | 30% | 20%     |
| 60s+      | 40%    | 30% | 30%     |

### **5. Consult a Financial Advisor:**
  
- For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

### **Conclusion:**
This strategic approach not only aims to maximize your retirement savings but also ensures you're making wise choices about taxes and investment opportunities. If you have more specific goals or financial situations in mind, feel free to share! üè¶‚ú®
