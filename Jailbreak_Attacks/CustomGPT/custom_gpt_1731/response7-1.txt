When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following points:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, providing immediate tax benefits. Ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding less tax-efficient investments in these accounts.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on growth-oriented funds if you're years away from retirement. Look for employer match opportunities.
   - **IRA:** Diversify between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) and use strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Emergency Funds & Liquidity:**
   - Ensure you maintain sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies before tying up all funds in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Advice & Adjustments:**
   - Regularly review and adjust the distribution based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. Seeking advice from a financial advisor can also be beneficial.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:

| Account Type      | Suggested % Allocation |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 401(k)            | 30%                   |
| Traditional IRA   | 20%                   |
| Roth IRA          | 10%                   |
| Taxable Account    | 40%                   |
