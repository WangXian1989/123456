When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown to help guide your strategy:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** If you have short-term cash needs (e.g., buying a home or starting a business), consider using taxable accounts for more liquid access.
   - **Retirement Planning:** Focus on maximizing contributions to retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) to leverage tax advantages.

### 2. **Understanding Account Types**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth).
     - Potential employer match; aim to contribute enough to maximize this benefit first.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deduction benefits; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - Contribution limits apply (check the current year's limits).
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No contribution limits; funds are accessible without penalties.
     - Subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 3. **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any company match (this is essentially "free money").
   - **IRA Contributions:** Contribute to an IRA next, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Consider a Balanced Portfolio**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Monitor your accounts regularly and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

| IRA                  | 20%            |
| Taxable Account      | 50%            |
