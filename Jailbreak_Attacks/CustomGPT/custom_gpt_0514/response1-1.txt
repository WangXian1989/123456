Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you're eligible. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) that generate fewer taxable events. Hold investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for diversified, long-term investments (stocks, bonds, etc.). 
   - In taxable accounts, you might keep more liquid or riskier investments, as you can manage your tax exposure more readily.

4. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, your withdrawal strategy will impact tax implications. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may help you let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
