When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize tax efficiency and growth potential:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out your contributions (2024 limit is $23,000, plus an additional catch-up contribution if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA (2024 limit is $6,500, $7,500 if over 50). Choose based on your tax situation (Roth for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, traditional for immediate tax deduction).

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals and can help with short-term goals or emergencies. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

3. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes. Higher-taxed investments (like bonds or REITs) are better placed in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from high tax rates.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a long-term horizon, lean towards more aggressive growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA. For shorter-term goals in taxable accounts, consider more conservative investments.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions across accounts. Adjust based on performance, tax law changes, or shifts in your financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
