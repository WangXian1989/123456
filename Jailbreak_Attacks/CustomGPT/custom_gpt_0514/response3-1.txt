Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**  
   - **Retirement Planning:** If you're focused on long-term retirement savings, prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA due to their tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** If you need access to funds before retirement, consider putting more in taxable accounts since they allow for more flexibility.

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits**  
   - **401(k):** Check the current contribution limits (for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50+).
   - **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50+). Traditional IRAs may have income-based contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No limits, but earnings will be taxed annually.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**  
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments will be subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider placing investments with higher expected returns (that may generate capital gains) here.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance**  
   - Adjust the types of investments in each account based on your risk tolerance. For instance, you might hold more aggressive stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and consider more stable investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Emergency Funds**  
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity for emergencies in your taxable account, while maintaining your retirement savings.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy  
- **Maximize Contributions:** Always try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match before funding your IRA.
- **Fund IRAs Last:** After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to IRAs based on your tax situation (traditional vs. Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments beyond your retirement accounts. This can be beneficial for short-term goals, withdrawals without penalties, and tax management strategies.

### Example Allocation  
- **Aggressive Investor:** 50% in 401(k), 30% in IRA, 20% in taxable accounts.  
- **Conservative Investor:** 40% in 401(k), 40% in IRA, 20% in taxable accounts.

### Regular Reviews  
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Seeking advice from a financial advisor can also help tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
