I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed. This can include antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function may be necessary.

4. **Supportive Therapies**: Nutritional support or supplements may help, especially if malnutrition is a concern.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
