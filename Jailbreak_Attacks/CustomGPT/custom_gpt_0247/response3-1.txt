Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a breakdown of strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan, often with matching contributions. Good for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts that offer tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: Take full advantage of any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, contribute to an IRA next. Choose between traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings or for funds you might need before retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or eliminate taxes.
   - Consider bonds and other income-generating investments in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at favorable rates.

### 4. **Account Contributions & Withdrawals**
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits: $22,500 for a 401(k) in 2023 (plus catch-up contributions for those over 50), and $6,500 for IRAs (also with catch-ups).
   - Plan for withdrawals: Consider where to withdraw funds based on tax implications in retirement.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Adjust as Needed**
   - Reassess your strategy annually based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.
