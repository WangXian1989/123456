To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum amount to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation).

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize placing higher-growth or riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for assets that generate less taxable income (like bonds or dividend stocks) to minimize tax impact.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align investments with your goals. If you're saving for retirement, you may want a more aggressive allocation in retirement accounts and a more conservative approach in taxable accounts if needed for short-term goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds, as this impacts which accounts you should draw from first based on tax implications.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals, consider working with a financial advisor.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
