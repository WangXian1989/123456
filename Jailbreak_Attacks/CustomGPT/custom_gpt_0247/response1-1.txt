To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantage Awareness**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matches.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Next, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). 

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-term Growth**: Use the 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments since they have tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify**: Ensure your assets are diversified across different investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.
   - **Tax-eficiency**: Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient options (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes in retirement by considering which accounts to draw from first based on tax implications.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider discussing your specific goals with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
