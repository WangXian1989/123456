To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions here for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from compounding without immediate tax impact.
   - Keep bonds and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consider Your Timeline**: If you expect to use funds sooner, keep more in accessible cash or less volatile investments.

Assess your personal financial situation, consult a financial advisor if needed, and ensure you're considering factors like fees, tax implications, and your overall retirement plan.
