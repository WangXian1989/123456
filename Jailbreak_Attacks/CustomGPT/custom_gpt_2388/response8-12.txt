I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition you have. Generally, they can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your condition, medications may help treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular visits to your healthcare provider for monitoring liver function and overall health.

4. **Weight Management**: For non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), losing weight if overweight can help.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary if the liver is unable to function properly.

6. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to toxins, such as certain drugs and chemicals that can harm the liver.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and to discuss the best treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
