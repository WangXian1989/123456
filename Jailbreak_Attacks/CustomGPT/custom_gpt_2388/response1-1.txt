The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After getting the employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) if it has low fees and good investment options. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions, while a Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are likely to generate less taxable income (like index funds) and to manage withdrawals for specific goals (like buying a home). This gives you flexibility and can help you manage tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk. This applies to all account types.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute and the market fluctuates, your asset allocation may shift. Regular rebalancing helps you maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in place, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

7. **Financial Goals**: Align your investments with your specific financial goals (retirement, purchasing a home, etc.) and time horizons. Longer-term goals might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance.

Ultimately, your individual circumstances will determine the ideal mix, so it's important to adjust as necessary over time.
