(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, income, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here are a few general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, it's typically best to contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, whether it's traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains or for money that you might need access to before retirement.

Diversifying across these accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawals and tax efficiency in retirement. It may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.

1. **401(k)**: First things first, if your company offers that sweet employer match, dive in and grab that money! It's like free gas for your retirement car. Max that bad boy out next, because who doesnâ€™t want to play the tax-deferred game?

2. **IRA**: After scooping up that 401(k) match, jump over to your IRA. If you can swing a Roth IRA, go for it! Paying taxes now could save you a boatload later if youâ€™re expecting a fat paycheck in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, sprinkle some of your cash into taxable accounts. Just keep in mind the tax implicationsâ€”try to stash investments that you donâ€™t mind paying taxes on or that you might need sooner than later.

In the end, itâ€™s about flexibility and playing the long game. Seriously consider chatting with a financial whiz to carve out a tailored plan that suits your financial vibe!
