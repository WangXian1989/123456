Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here is a general guide to help you decide how to allocate your funds:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**

- **401(k)**: An employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax advantages. Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also offers tax advantages but has contribution limits. There are two main types: Traditional (tax-deductible contributions but taxed upon withdrawal) and Roth (after-tax contributions grow tax-free and are not taxed upon withdrawal).
- **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for more flexible access to your funds but are subject to capital gains tax on earnings.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals and Timelines**

- **Short-term Needs**: If you need access to your money in the near future (0-5 years), prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Mid to Long-term Goals**: For retirement savings (10+ years), focus on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for growth potential.

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**

- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider future tax implications. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for assets that generate capital gains or dividends, as you'll face taxes on those earnings.

### 4. **Determine Your Contribution Strategy**

- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: Try to max out your IRA contributions if you are eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for additional savings above 401(k) and IRA limits or for investments that you may want to access before retirement age.

### 5. **Adjust Your Asset Allocation**

- **Investing for Growth**: In retirement accounts, consider a more aggressive asset allocation (stocks, mutual funds) since these accounts are long-term.
- **Less Volatility in Taxable Accounts**: Keep more stable investments, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 6. **Review Regularly**

- **Reassess Your Strategy**: Life circumstances change (salary increases, family changes, market conditions). Periodically review and adjust your allocations accordingly.

### Example Allocation Strategy:

- **Young Professional** (20s-30s): 
  - 401(k): 15% 
  - IRA: 10% 
  - Taxable: 5% 
- **Middle-Aged** (40s-50s): 
  - 401(k): 20% 
  - IRA: 15% 
  - Taxable: 10% 
- **Pre-Retirement** (60s): 
  - 401(k): 10% 
  - IRA: 30% 
  - Taxable: 15% 

### Conclusion

The best distribution strategy varies based on individual circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation and goals.
