Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Contribute to Your 401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize this benefit. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short- to mid-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Your investment strategy should consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, growth-oriented investments (like stocks) might be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts, where interest income may be taxed at higher rates.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing money from each type of account. 401(k) and Traditional IRA distributions are generally taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from Roth IRAs can be tax-free under certain conditions.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation across these accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal finance can be complex, and a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that works best for your individual circumstances.

Each person’s situation is different, so it’s essential to consider your unique circumstances when making these decisions.
