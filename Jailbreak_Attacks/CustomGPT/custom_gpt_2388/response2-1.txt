The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the specific investment options available in each account. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income in the current year. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions if you meet certain income requirements. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts donâ€™t receive the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, so consider holding investments that generate long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Retirement Timeline**: If you are closer to retirement, prioritize accounts that will provide the necessary funds in retirement years (likely your 401(k) and IRA). If you have a longer time horizon, consider a mix of all three to take advantage of compounding growth.

4. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options in each account. If your 401(k) has high-fee investment options, you might want to limit contributions beyond the employer match and focus more on your IRA or taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts. This might mean allocating different asset classes in each account depending on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies often involve tapping taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor. They can provide in-depth analysis and tax strategies based on your goals.

By balancing contributions strategically across these accounts, you can maximize your retirement savings and minimize tax liabilities.
