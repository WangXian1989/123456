The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guide:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limit**: Max out contributions if possible. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (plus $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Benefits**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Use Traditional IRAs to reduce taxable income if you expect a lower tax bracket.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for shorter-term goals since they allow easier access to funds without penalties.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds).

### **General Strategy**
1. **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**.
2. **Contribute to IRA up to the limit**.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings or short-term goals**.

### **Allocation Tips**
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across accounts to mitigate risks.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
