Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching Contributions (401(k))**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full match** if available, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after taxes, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is advantageous if you believe your income (and tax rate) will be higher in the future.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. These accounts are good for short-term goals, as they allow access to funds without penalties.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - In all accounts, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.
   - Consider placing lower-growth, more stable investments in taxable accounts, as they may incur fewer tax consequences.

### 6. **Ongoing Review**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out employer match, then contribute up to the annual limit.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Max out contributions to the IRA after 401(k).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings here, especially for short-term goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
- For personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, it’s wise to consult a financial advisor. They can help tailor a plan that suits your needs.
