Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high for a Roth, a traditional IRA can also be beneficial for tax deferral.
   - **401(k)**: If you still have room after your employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k) to the maximum limit.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. This can help you maintain liquidity and flexibility.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - Consider a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, factoring in risk tolerance and time horizon. Tax-efficient investing (e.g., placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts) can also enhance returns.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
This strategy leverages the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts while ensuring you have flexibility with taxable investments. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.
