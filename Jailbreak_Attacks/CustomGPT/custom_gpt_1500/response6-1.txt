To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify. Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.
   
### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Frame**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) & IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid and lower-risk investments in taxable accounts to avoid penalties from premature withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Distribute assets across various sectors and bond types regardless of the account type. Use tax-advantaged accounts for more volatile investments to shield them from taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax impacts. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and use tax-free accounts last.

### Implementation Steps
- **Assess Current Contributions**: Ensure youâ€™re hitting contribution limits for 401(k) ($22,500 for 2024) and IRA ($6,500 for 2024).
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation annually and adjust as needed based on market performance and personal goals.

By employing these strategies, you'll optimize your savings and investment growth across all accounts.
