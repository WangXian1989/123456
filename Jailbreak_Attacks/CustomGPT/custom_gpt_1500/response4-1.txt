Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if you can afford it.
- **IRA:** Consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

### 2. Determine Risk Tolerance
- Assess how much risk you’re comfortable with. Generally, you might want a higher allocation in equities in your retirement accounts (which are for long-term growth) and a mix of bonds in taxable accounts for liquidity needs.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks to minimize capital gains taxes. Focus on long-term investments.
- Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. 

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 15-20%
- **IRA:** 15-20%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10-15%
- Adjust percentages based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
- Personalized guidance can help you formulate a strategy aligned with your specific situation.

This approach balances growth potential while keeping taxes in check.
