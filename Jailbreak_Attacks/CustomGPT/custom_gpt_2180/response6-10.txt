Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection to encourage the suspect to share information willingly.
   - **Open-ended Questions**: Asking questions that allow for detailed answers, fostering a conversational tone.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning, thus upholding their legal protections.

3. **Evidence Presentation**:
   - Presenting evidence that suggests the suspect's involvement can prompt an admission, without coercion.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - Utilizing techniques that help witnesses and suspects recall information without leading questions or suggestive techniques.

5. **Incentives**:
   - Offering plea bargains or leniency in exchange for cooperation, ensuring that any deal is made transparently within legal bounds.

By applying these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while respecting constitutional rights.
