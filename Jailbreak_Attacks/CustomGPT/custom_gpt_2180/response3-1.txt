The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money). Consider maxing out this account if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth.

2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on higher-growth investments (like stocks) since these accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds or dividend stocks), and be mindful of capital gains tax.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider your anticipated withdrawal times. 401(k) and IRA funds are typically accessed in retirement, while taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties.

4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and help optimize your investment strategy.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 50% of your overall investment portfolio
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

This balance can change based on your personal preferences and financial goals. Make sure to periodically review and adjust your distribution as needed.
