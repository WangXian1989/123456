Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Prioritize contributing enough to receive any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if your financial situation allows, especially if you are in a high tax bracket and seeking tax deferral.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Depending on your income, consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) is beneficial.
   - Aim for the maximum contribution to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that may produce taxable income, such as dividend-paying stocks or bond funds.
   - Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like REITs or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### General Strategy

- **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts, as they are more liquid.
- **Long-term Goals**: Favor tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Balance investments based on their tax treatment to optimize after-tax returns.

### Conclusion

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific goals and circumstances.
