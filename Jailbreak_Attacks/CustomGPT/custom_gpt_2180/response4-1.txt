The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize your employer match. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or income, as they are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse portfolio to manage risk effectively. 

5. **Investment Horizons**: Match your investment type with your time horizon. Longer horizons can accommodate more aggressive investments.

6. **Regular Reevaluation**: Review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

7. **Consult a Professional**: If you're unsure, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

By considering these aspects, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your accounts.
