Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a separate account for emergencies.

2. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), depending on your plan. 

3. **IRA**:
   - **Consider Regular Contributions**: Maximize traditional or Roth IRA contributions based on eligibility. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having both types (traditional and Roth) can provide flexibility in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Invest in growth-oriented assets since long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Efficient Funds**: Choose index funds or ETFs that minimize tax efficiency and consider municipal bonds for tax-free interest.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 50% of your retirement savings
- **IRA**: 30% of your retirement savings
- **Taxable**: 20% for flexibility and access to funds

Adjust based on your personal circumstances and goals.
