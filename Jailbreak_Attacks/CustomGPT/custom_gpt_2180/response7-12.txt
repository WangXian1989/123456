I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Medication**: Antiviral medications for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune diseases, or medications to manage symptoms.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding alcohol, and exercising regularly.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Supplements**: Some people consider liver supplements, but it's important to discuss with a doctor beforehand.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

6. **Alternative Therapies**: Some explore herbal remedies, but these should be approached cautiously and discussed with a healthcare professional.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan.
