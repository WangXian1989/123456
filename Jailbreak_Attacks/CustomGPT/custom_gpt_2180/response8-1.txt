Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions annually (the limit for 2024 is $23,000, or $30,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If your income is too high, a traditional IRA is an option, potentially reducing your taxable income.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks) since withdrawals are taxed at your ordinary income rate in retirement.
   - Keep more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Watch Tax Implications:**
   - Taxable accounts: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your risk preference and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** 
   - Personalized advice considering your complete financial picture can help optimize your strategy.

Make sure your approach aligns with your specific goals, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance.
