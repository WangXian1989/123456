Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can help maximize your retirement savings and minimize taxes. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). The limit for IRA contributions is $6,500 per year (or $7,500 if you're over 50) for 2023.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on your 401(k) and Traditional IRA for funds that you wonâ€™t need until retirement; these grow tax-deferred.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts**: Use a Roth IRA for contributions you'll want to withdraw tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement. Be mindful of taxes on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally:
   - Stocks for long-term growth (401(k) and IRAs)
   - Bonds for stability (can be in all accounts)
   - Cash or cash equivalents for short-term goals (taxable accounts)

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Take Advantage of Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, consider selling underperforming investments to offset capital gains taxes.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy carefully to minimize taxes. Often, it's advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to manage your tax bracket effectively.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
