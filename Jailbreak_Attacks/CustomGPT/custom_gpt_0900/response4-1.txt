To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key principles:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Start with your 401(k) and IRA contributions. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance growth over time.
   - For a 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k) (with a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Choose investments based on each account's tax situation. Generally, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes as they grow.
   - Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds) and assets that generate short-term capital gains in taxable accounts, as they are taxed at a lower rate when held long-term.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance as needed to maintain your target asset allocation. This helps manage risk and ensures you're on track for your financial goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals carefully. In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. 

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If youâ€™re uncertain, working with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy based on your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced investment approach that optimizes your returns while minimizing tax implications.
