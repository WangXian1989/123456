To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching contributions. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Allows you to save for retirement with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs give tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts where you invest after-tax income. They provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: If you can, aim to contribute to your IRA (Roth or traditional based on your eligibility) after maximizing the match in your 401(k).
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have capacity, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged contributions.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on higher-growth investments here since you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments or those that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Withdrawal Considerations**
   - Plan how and when you’ll access these funds in retirement to minimize taxes. For instance, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-deferred accounts to grow.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Assess your contributions and asset allocation annually. Adjust based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

### Example Allocation
- Start with 401(k): 10% of salary (enough for full match)
- Next, contribute to Roth IRA: up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50)
- Max out the 401(k): increase contributions to $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50)
- Allocate surplus funds to taxable accounts.

By balancing these contributions based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation, you can optimize your overall investment strategy.
