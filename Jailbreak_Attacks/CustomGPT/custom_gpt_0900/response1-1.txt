When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as regular income.
   - **IRA**: Both Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages. Traditional IRAs are funded with pre-tax dollars (taxed upon withdrawal), while Roth IRAs are funded with post-tax dollars (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t have the same tax advantages, but you can use capital loss deductions and pay taxes only on realized gains.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term and long-term goals. If you need access to funds in the near future, prioritize taxable accounts, as 401(k) and IRA funds come with penalties for early withdrawal.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (plus $7,500 catch-up if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up).

4. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributions there up to the match limit to maximize free money.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Suggested Approach:

1. **Max out the 401(k) match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Start with a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth.
3. **Increase 401(k) contributions**: After reaching IRA limits, boost your 401(k) to the maximum limit.
4. **Use taxable accounts for extra savings**: For flexibility or to meet short-term goals.

### Example:
- You earn $80,000. You could contribute $20,000 to your 401(k) (including the match), $6,500 to a Roth IRA, and any additional savings can be directed to a taxable account for emergencies or short-term goals.

### Regular Review:
Reassess your allocations yearly or after significant life events to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance. 

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific situation.
