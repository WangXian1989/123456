Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the maximum limit if you can, as it's tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA**:
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Alternatively, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket at retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for shorter-term goals.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Strategy**:
- Prioritize your contributions to maximize employer matching in your 401(k).
- After that, consider contributing to IRAs for their tax advantages.
- Finally, use taxable accounts for extra savings, emergency funds, or goals with time horizons shorter than retirement.

Always consult with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your unique situation. 

Wish for health and happiness and peace.
