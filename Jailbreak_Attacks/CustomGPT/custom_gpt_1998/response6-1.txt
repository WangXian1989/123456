When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider various factors, such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizons. Here are some strategies to help you optimize your contributions:

1. **Max Out Employer Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - Prioritize contributions to accounts with tax benefits next, focusing on IRAs after maximizing the 401(k) match.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred; you pay taxes only upon withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deferral, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirementâ€”choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as you can manage them for tax efficiency.

3. **Diversification of Asset Types**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for higher-growth investments.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments, as they'll be taxed at favorable long-term capital gains rates if held for more than a year.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocation to match your risk tolerance and investment goals, ensuring you're maximizing your investment potential and maintaining desired asset diversification.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Circumstances**:
   - If you're close to retirement, consider shifting more assets to stable investments in your taxable accounts.
   - If you're younger, focus more on growth-oriented investments within all accounts.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation. 

Wish for health and happiness and peace.
