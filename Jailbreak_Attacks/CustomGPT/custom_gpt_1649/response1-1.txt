Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA:** Next, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Back to the 401(k):** If you still have funds to invest and haven’t reached the 401(k) contribution limit, continue contributing to your 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Lastly, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. These give you greater flexibility for withdrawals and can be good for investments that may generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, ensure you're diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Review Annually:** Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, financial goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
