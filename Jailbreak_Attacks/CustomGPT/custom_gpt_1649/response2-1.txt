Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income year, prioritize maximizing your contributions (up to $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,000 if over 50 in 2023).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If your income exceeds Roth limits, use a traditional IRA, but be aware of potential tax implications upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investing in various assets, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk and potential returns.

5. **Consider Investment Horizon and Goals**: Align your investments with your goals. For long-term goals (like retirement), a more aggressive portfolio may be appropriate, while shorter-term goals may require more conservative investments.

6. **Review Tax Efficiency**: Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and let tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) reside in tax-advantaged accounts when possible.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations among accounts to ensure they meet your objectives as your situation changes.

It's always beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
