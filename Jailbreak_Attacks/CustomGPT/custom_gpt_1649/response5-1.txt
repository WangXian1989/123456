Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to capture that match—it’s essentially free money. Focus on maxing out your contributions if you can afford it, as 401(k) plans often have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out your 401(k) and if you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. Tax optimization strategies, like focusing on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs), can help manage tax liability.

### Example Distribution Strategy:

- **401(k)**: Max out the contribution limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2024) to capture employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50) to a Roth or traditional IRA, focusing on tax strategy based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can be distributed into taxable accounts, where you can choose investments based on your risk tolerance and goals.

Always review your plan annually and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and long-term financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
