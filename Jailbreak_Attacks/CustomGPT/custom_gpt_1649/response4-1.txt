Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to 401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: The 401(k) typically has higher contribution limits compared to an IRA, making it a great option for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs can offer tax-deductible contributions depending on your income, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Having both types of accounts can provide flexibility during retirement in terms of tax planning.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - **Invest for Shorter-Term Goals**: If you need access to funds before retirement, taxable accounts offer liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Tax Planning**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, you may prioritize Roth accounts now to pay taxes at the lower current rates.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - **Younger Investors**: Consider being more aggressive in growth-oriented assets in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Shift towards preserving capital, potentially by reallocating riskier investments from tax-deferred accounts to taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - **Monitor Your Allocations**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances and goals.
