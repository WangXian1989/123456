Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **First Priority:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Tax Advantages:** If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Check the annual contribution limits and potential income phase-outs.

### 3. **Continue Contributing to Your 401(k)**
   - **Beyond the Match:** After maximizing your IRA contributions, redirect additional funds to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After Maxing Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Any extra savings can go into taxable accounts. This is helpful for liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, like using index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:

| Account Type     | Considerations                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **401(k)**       | Max out employer match; then contribute up to the limit. |
| **IRA**          | Contribute fully to Roth or Traditional based on eligibility. |
| **Taxable**      | Invest in low-cost index funds after other accounts are maxed. |

### Factors to Consider:
- **Time Horizon:** Longer time frames may allow for more risk in your investments.
- **Tax Situation:** Understand your current and expected future tax brackets.
- **Retirement Goals:** Align your contributions with your retirement income needs.
