Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; pre-tax or Roth options.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts; tax advantages depend on type.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No special tax advantages, but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**
   - **Short-term** (buying a house, travel): Focus on taxable accounts for easy access.
   - **Medium-term** (major purchases): Use a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Long-term** (retirement): Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions to take full advantage of employer match.
   - Contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits, choosing between traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) based on your current vs. future tax rate.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
| Account Type   | Contribution Priority | Notes                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **401(k)**     | 1st                   | Maximize employer match, defer taxes.  |
| **IRA**        | 2nd                   | Choose between Traditional/Roth based on tax strategy. |
| **Taxable**    | 3rd                   | Allocate extra funds for flexibility; consider tax-efficient investments. |

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
- Regularly review your investment performance and adjust allocations based on life changes (e.g., salary increases, change in financial goals).
