Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Contribute enough to at least get the full employer match, as it’s essentially "free" money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Roth IRA/Traditional IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA next. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions up to the annual limit after the employer match.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement age without penalties.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Consider Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Typically limited to employer-selected funds, often higher fees.
   - **IRA**: More flexibility with investment choices (stocks, bonds, ETFs).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in diversified assets, taking capital gains and losses into account for tax efficiency.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
| Account Type      | Suggested Focus          |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 401(k)            | Maximize employer match, then contribute up to the limit. |
| IRA (Roth/Traditional) | Contribute to max limit after 401(k) match. |
| Taxable Account    | Invest any surplus funds; focus on tax-efficient options. |

### Additional Considerations:
- **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors may lean towards more aggressive growth investments.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Always align your investments with your comfort level concerning risk.
