Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide:

### General Guidelines for Distribution

| Account Type        | Key Features                                     | Best For                                                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **401(k)**          | Tax-deferred; possible employer match            | Maximize contributions, especially if employer matches.     |
| **IRA**             | Tax advantages; wider investment choices         | Supplement retirement savings and potentially reduce taxable income. |
| **Taxable Accounts**| Flexible access; capital gains taxes applicable | Short-term goals or when you need liquidity without penalties. |

### Considerations: 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantage**: 
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth to minimize taxes over time.

3. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term, as they don’t have withdrawal penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Tailor the investments based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. For example, more aggressive stocks in your 401(k) and IRA, while keeping safer investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Planning**: 
   - Be mindful of tax implications for distributions. Retirement accounts typically have penalties if withdrawn early.

### Suggested Strategy

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the employer match.
   - Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.

2. **IRA**:
   - Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest any additional funds here for flexibility and diversification.

### Final Thoughts

- Reassess your strategy annually based on changes in your income, goals, and the overall market conditions.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
