Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the best practices:

### 1. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs are tax-deferred. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed in the year they are sold, plus dividends and interest are taxable in the year they are received.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts First:**
   - After getting the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Assess Your Needs:**
   - If you need liquidity or expect to withdraw funds before retirement, consider more contributions to your taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

### Example Distribution Strategy:

| Account Type  | Contribution Priority | Notes                                      |
|---------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 401(k)        | High                 | Contribute enough to get full employer match |
| IRA           | High                 | Prioritize Roth IRA for tax-free growth   |
| Taxable       | Moderate/Low        | Use for short-term goals or if needing liquidity |

### 6. **Rebalance as Needed:**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
