To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, as they offer tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest additional funds here for flexibility, as these accounts have fewer tax benefits but no contribution limits.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now; taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates. Roth is funded with after-tax dollars, while Traditional offers a tax deduction.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Favor tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Investment Allocation:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since taxes are deferred.
   - Consider placing more conservative assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger investors might favor aggressive growth strategies in retirement accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
| Account Type      | Contribution Priority | Typical Investments     |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| 401(k)            | High (to match)       | Stocks, target-date funds|
| IRA                | Medium (tax benefits) | Stocks or bonds         |
| Taxable Accounts   | Low (flexible access) | Index funds, ETFs, cash |

Regularly reassess your investments based on changes in goals, market conditions, or tax laws.
