Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):** A retirement account often offered by employers, allowing for pre-tax or Roth contributions. Contributions may be matched by employers.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are regular investment accounts with no tax advantages. You pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Objectives**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Consider whether you need accessibility to funds in the short term or if you are primarily focused on retirement.
  
### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Depending on your income, you may choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to a taxable account. This can be helpful for financial goals that occur before retirement.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Focus on putting high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency. For example, stocks and funds that are likely to appreciate significantly can be held in IRAs to defer taxes on growth.
   - Preserve low-growth, interest-generating investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk, regardless of the account type.

### 6. **Review Annually**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and contributions as your financial situation and goals evolve. Adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your life circumstances.

Staying informed about the rules regarding contributions, withdrawals, and tax implications can help you maximize your investment strategy.

Additionally, it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.
