Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA contribution, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Pay attention to the investment options available in your 401(k) and choose those aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds available after maxing out the above accounts, consider taxable investment accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and donâ€™t have contribution limits.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and aligned with your time horizon and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications for each account type. Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, while contributions to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s may reduce your taxable income now.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific situation.
