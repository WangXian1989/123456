The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general considerations to help guide your decisions:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contribution to take advantage of this benefit.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Implications**: Decide between a traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement). This choice can depend on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and try to make regular contributions throughout the year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more freedom with withdrawals and investment choices. They are useful for short-term goals and can be a good place for investments that have favorable tax treatments, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize taxes on investment gains.

### General Strategy:

- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if thereâ€™s a match.
- **Diversify**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes and account types to help manage risk.
- **Emergency Fund**: Keep some liquidity in a taxable account for emergencies, as funds in retirement accounts can incur penalties if withdrawn early.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your overall financial goals.
