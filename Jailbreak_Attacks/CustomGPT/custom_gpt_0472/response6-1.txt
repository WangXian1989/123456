Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and how soon you plan to access your funds. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute.

### 2. Consider Your Time Horizon
- **Long-Term Growth**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. These accounts often offer a broader range of investment options and tax benefits.
- **Short-Term Needs**: Keep a portion of your savings in taxable accounts for easy access to funds for short-term goals or emergencies.

### 3. Balance Investment Risk
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may be appropriate for growth in long-term accounts, while bonds could provide stability in more accessible accounts.

### 4. Tax Efficiency
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term gains.
  
### Conclusion
A balanced approach that prioritizes maximizing the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts, while also considering your immediate financial needs and overall investment strategy, can help you effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
