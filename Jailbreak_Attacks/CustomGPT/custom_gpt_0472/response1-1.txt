Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Max out your contributions if possible to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - Consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It’s a good option for tax diversification.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investment options outside of retirement accounts, particularly if you want more flexibility in withdrawals.
   - Consider holding investments with lower tax implications here, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
- Fund your IRA next, especially if you're considering a Roth IRA.
- Once you’ve contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, invest any remaining funds into your taxable accounts.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Age and Goals**: Younger investors may focus more on tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may lean towards liquidity and tax efficiency.
- **Investment Mix**: Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Tax Impact**: Be mindful of taxes in your taxable accounts and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies if applicable.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances.
