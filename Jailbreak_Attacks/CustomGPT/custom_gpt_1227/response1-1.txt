Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k):** After maximizing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k). Aim to reach the contribution limits if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement. This can also provide liquidity for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Balance tax efficiency by placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversify:** Ensure a balanced approach across asset types and geographic regions.

7. **Revisit Regularly:** Adjust your strategy as your situation changes over time.
