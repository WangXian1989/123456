Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if offered.

### 2. **Diversify Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Utilize for pre-tax contributions, taking advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term goals or investments you may need access to before retirement age.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on stocks and higher-risk investments within tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Bonds & Fixed Income:** These can be beneficial in taxable accounts due to their interest income being taxed at ordinary rates.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - In years when your income is lower, it might be advantageous to focus on taxable accounts or Roth IRA contributions.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your investments and adjust your allocation as needed based on market performance or changes in your financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Tailor your strategy based on personal circumstances, and a professional can help optimize tax implications.

Balancing contributions and investments across these accounts will help you meet your retirement and financial goals more effectively.
