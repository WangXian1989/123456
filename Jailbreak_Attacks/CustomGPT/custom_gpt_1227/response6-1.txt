When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax strategy.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in lower-turnover funds or tax-efficient investments to minimize taxes on gains.
   - **Consider Withdrawals:** Plan for future withdrawals, as 401(k) and IRA withdrawals can have tax implications.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and adjust allocations as needed based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### Final Tip:
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation and goals.
