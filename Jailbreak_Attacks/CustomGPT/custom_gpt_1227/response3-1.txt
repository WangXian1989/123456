Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments:
   - Invest in lower-turnover index funds or tax-efficient ETFs to minimize taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since they provide liquidity without penalties.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications in each account type. 
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals, beneficial for retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on investment performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances, consider speaking with a certified financial planner.

Always consider your overall financial picture and long-term goals when making these decisions.
