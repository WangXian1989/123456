I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition you are facing. General options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications to manage symptoms or complications might be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant or other surgical interventions may be considered.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized approach.
