To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, as they can offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.
  
2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Check the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRAs to ensure you're optimizing your investments.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Taxable accounts can be used for more liquid investments, while retirement accounts can be more growth-focused.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Consider your future need for liquidity. Taxable accounts are easier to access without penalties, whereas retirement accounts have restrictions until you reach a certain age.

6. **Tax Management**:
   - Strategically place investments in the appropriate accounts. For example, it may be beneficial to keep bonds in tax-advantaged accounts where interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.
