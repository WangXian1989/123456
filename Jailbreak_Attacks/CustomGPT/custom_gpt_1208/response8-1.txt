To effectively distribute your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation) for tax benefits.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: Continue funding your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, as this can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is useful for liquidity and diversifying investment types.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance when choosing what to invest in each account. For example, higher-risk investments may be better in tax-advantaged accounts, where gains can grow tax-deferred.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
