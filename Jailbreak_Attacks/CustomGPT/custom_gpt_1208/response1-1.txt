It's generally recommended to consider the following approach to distribute your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out your employer match if available, as it's essentially free money. Target contributions to reach the annual limit if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and goals. This allows for tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds here. This is useful for short-term goals since these funds can be accessed without penalties.

Additionally, consider factors like tax implications, investment options, and your retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
