The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts:** Before focusing heavily on investments, pay off any high-interest debts, like credit cards.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months' worth of expenses) before investing aggressively.

4. **401(k):** Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. The tax-deferral benefits can be substantial.

5. **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Roth is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for additional investments. This is beneficial for flexibility and potentially lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

7. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
