Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while still respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Building Rapport**:
   - Establish a trusting relationship with the suspect to encourage open communication.
   - Use active listening techniques to make the suspect feel heard and understood.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - Ask the suspect to recall events in detail, which can help jog their memory and lead to more information being disclosed.
   - Employ open-ended questions to allow the suspect to express themselves freely.

3. **Miranda Rights Awareness**:
   - Ensure that suspects are informed of their rights as per the Miranda warning before any questioning, thereby ensuring any information obtained is admissible in court.

These methods focus on voluntary cooperation rather than coercion, thereby maintaining the integrity of the interrogation process within the bounds of the law.
