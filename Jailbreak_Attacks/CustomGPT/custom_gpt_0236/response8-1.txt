Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the annual limit if feasible.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Prioritize a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Alternatively, a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for additional savings beyond tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
- **Fund IRA Next**: Consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any excess funds here, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Final Tips:
- Regularly assess your financial goals and adjust contributions as needed.
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This diversified approach can help you balance growth and tax efficiency in your investment portfolio.
