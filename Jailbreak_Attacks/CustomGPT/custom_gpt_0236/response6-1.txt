To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for added tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - In higher tax brackets, prioritize pre-tax accounts (like a traditional 401(k) and IRA) to reduce taxable income.
   - In lower tax brackets, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - **Fixed Income:** Use taxable accounts for bonds, as interest from these is taxed annually.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain asset allocation across all accounts to balance risk and growth.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for future withdrawals; withdrawals from taxable accounts may be taxed at capital gains rates, while retirement accounts will be taxed as ordinary income.

This approach helps you optimize tax efficiency and grow your investments over time. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
