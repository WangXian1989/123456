Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement:** Prioritize retirement accounts like 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for money you may need sooner.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match; consider increasing based on your tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute the maximum to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax strategy.

### 3. **Investment Choices**
   - **401(k):** Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA:** Diversify with a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Use Traditional accounts for higher marginal tax years and Roth accounts in lower tax years.
   - Balance between tax-deferred (401(k) and IRA) and taxable accounts based on your tax forecast.

### 5. **Maintenance and Review**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### 6. **Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 60%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10%

Adjust percentages based on your goals, age, and risk tolerance.
