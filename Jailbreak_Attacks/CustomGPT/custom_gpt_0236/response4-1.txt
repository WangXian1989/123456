To effectively distribute your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing up to the annual limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, since contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions depending on your income.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and timelines.

4. **Tax-Efficient Investing in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Hold investments that generate capital gains in taxable accounts, since long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Consider municipal bonds or index funds to minimize taxes on dividends.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Reassess your portfolio periodically to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your goals, especially as you approach retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a tailored strategy that considers your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This balance can help optimize your retirement savings while managing tax implications effectively.
