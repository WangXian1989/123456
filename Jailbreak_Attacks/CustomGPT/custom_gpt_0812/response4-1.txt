To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can be more beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth, higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Utilize lower-growth, more stable investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - In a taxable account, focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically incur fewer capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy carefully: start with taxable accounts to preserve tax-advantaged growth, then draw from tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investments, focusing on performance, risk tolerance, and life changes, adjusting contributions as needed.

This strategy balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
