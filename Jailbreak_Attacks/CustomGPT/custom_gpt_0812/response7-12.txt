I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol and illicit drugs.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.
4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary if the liver is severely damaged.

Consult a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.
