To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth. Consider maximizing contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also tax-deferred, ideal for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investment flexibility. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Types**: Place high-growth investments (which may generate higher capital gains) in your tax-advantaged accounts and lower-risk or income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced allocation across accounts to meet your long-term investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
