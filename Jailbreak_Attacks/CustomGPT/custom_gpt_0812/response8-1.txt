Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a breakdown to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If you havenâ€™t met the employer match, prioritize this. Contribution limits are higher than IRAs.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free growth) for tax diversification.

### 3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to take advantage of lower tax rates.
   - Keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, you may want to prioritize tax-deferred accounts.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider Roth options.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have liquidity outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Individual circumstances vary, so professional advice can tailor strategies to your specific situation.

Ensure each account serves a purpose in your overall financial plan.
