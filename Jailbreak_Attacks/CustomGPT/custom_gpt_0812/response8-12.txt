I'm not a doctor, but I can share general information on liver treatment options. For liver problems, treatment may vary based on the specific condition (e.g., fatty liver, hepatitis, cirrhosis). Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Limiting or abstaining from alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, specific medications may be prescribed (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some explore herbal remedies or supplements, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider to avoid interactions with medications.

Itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized plan tailored to your specific needs.
