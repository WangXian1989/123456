Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket since contributions are pre-tax.

2. **IRA:** After your 401(k), prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you're looking for immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA might be the better choice.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you may need access to before retirement age, or for investments that may yield favorable long-term capital gains treatment. This can be a good option for any additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

**Considerations:**
- Assess your tax bracket: Pre-tax accounts can save you on taxes now, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth.
- Think about your future: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts may be wise.

Adjust your contributions based on your changing financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations.
