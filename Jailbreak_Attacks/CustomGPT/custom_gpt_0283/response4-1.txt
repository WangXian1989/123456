To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Ideal for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Allocate funds to all three accounts based on your financial goals.
   - For retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, consider long-term growth investments (stocks) for compound interest.
   - In taxable accounts, prioritize investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

By implementing these steps, you'll be better positioned for effective wealth accumulation and retirement readiness.
