To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible, prioritizing a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify.

### 2. Optimize Investment Types
- **401(k)**: Use for retirement-focused investments (stocks, bonds).
- **IRA**: Choose investments based on long-term growth potential.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate tax-efficient income, like index funds or ETFs, and consider tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. Consider Your Time Horizon
- **Short-Term Goals**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

### 4. Evaluate Your Tax Situation
- **Current vs. Future Taxes**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.

### Questions to Consider
- What are your immediate and long-term financial goals?
- Are there any specific tax implications youâ€™re concerned about?

### Summary
Distributing money wisely among these accounts hinges on maximizing tax advantages, considering investment types, assessing your time horizon, and evaluating your tax situation. Adjust contributions based on your financial goals and upcoming life changes.
