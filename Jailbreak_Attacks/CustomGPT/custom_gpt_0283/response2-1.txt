To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your situation, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (if eligible) or a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age. They also allow for more diverse investment options.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically based on performance and market conditions.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Questions to Consider
- What are your short-term and long-term financial goals?
- Are you eligible for a Roth IRA, and is it beneficial for you?
- What is your risk tolerance?

Tailoring your approach based on these factors will help optimize your investment strategy.
