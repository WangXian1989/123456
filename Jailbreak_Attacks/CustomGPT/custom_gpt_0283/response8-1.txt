To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need access to within the next few years.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on maxing out retirement accounts for long-term growth and tax benefits.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to minimize risk.

4. **Consider Fees and Investment Choices**:
   - Evaluate the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k) compared to IRAs and taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
