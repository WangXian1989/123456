Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.

### 2. Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your income. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement; traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

### 3. Taxable Accounts for Additional Flexibility
   - Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investing. This includes stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

### 4. Consider Investment Types
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Hold investments that generate high income (like bonds) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 5. Regular Rebalancing
   - Review and adjust your allocations yearly based on performance and changing life circumstances.

### Key Considerations
- **Tax Bracket**: Higher income might favor traditional accounts for immediate tax benefits.
- **Retirement Age**: Earlier retirement may push for more accessible funds in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
A balanced mix prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first, then taxable accounts for flexibility is often the best strategy. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
