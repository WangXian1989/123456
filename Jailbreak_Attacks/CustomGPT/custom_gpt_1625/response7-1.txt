Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts:** After maximizing your match, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and traditional IRA. These accounts lower your taxable income now, which can be advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties at any age, providing liquidity. Use these accounts for investment opportunities or short-term savings goals.

5. **Asset Allocation Considerations:** Keep in mind the types of investments in each account type. Generally, it's best to hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Periodic Review and Adjustments:** Regularly assess your allocation based on your goals, market conditions, and changes in your personal situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy to your specific circumstances and ensure youâ€™re maximizing your retirement savings.
