Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Balance Contributions
- **Tax Impact:** Consider the tax implications of withdrawals. Traditional accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts aren’t.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a mix of pre-tax (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) assets to manage taxes in retirement.

### 3. Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely
- **Emergency Fund:** Keep liquidity for short-term needs. Taxable accounts can be good for this.
- **Long-Term Investments:** Invest in assets with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Regularly Review and Adjust
- **Rebalance Portfolio:** Adjust allocations annually or after significant market movements to maintain your risk level.
- **Life Changes:** Reassess your distribution strategy as your income, goals, or tax laws change.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
