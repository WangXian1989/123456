(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, here's a balanced approach:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored plans**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Any savings beyond this can be placed in taxable accounts. These offer more liquidity and flexibility, though you'll pay taxes on any gains.

Diversification across these accounts can help balance tax advantages and accessibility based on your retirement goals and needs.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, hereâ€™s how to make your money work for you across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accountsâ€”with a little savvy twist:

1. **401(k) to the max**: First up, if your employer offers a match, snag that free cash! Contribute enough to hit that. It's like finding cash in your jacket every payday. 
2. **IRA time**: Dive into an IRA next. If you want tax-free growth, go for a Roth if you qualify. If you're looking for immediate tax benefits, a traditional IRA can work. Just keep an eye on those income limits!
3. **Taxable accounts**: Once youâ€™ve beefed up your retirement accounts, throw your extra cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and you won't be hit with penalties for withdrawing, unlike retirement accounts. Just remember, youâ€™ll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

Mix it up wisely, and always keep an eye on your long-term goals. Happy investing!
