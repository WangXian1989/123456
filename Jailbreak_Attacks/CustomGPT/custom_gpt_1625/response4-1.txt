Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your workplace offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your growth over time.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For goals within the next 5 years, consider keeping funds in a taxable account, focusing on more liquid, stable investments.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: For retirement, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, but you'll pay tax upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with different rules around contributions and withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay capital gains tax when you sell investments; consider holding assets long enough to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific situation can provide personalized recommendations.

Balancing contributions across these accounts can help you optimize tax efficiency and support your overall financial goals.
