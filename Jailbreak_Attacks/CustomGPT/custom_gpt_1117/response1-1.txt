Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Consider contributing up to the employer match and then evaluate further contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when deciding.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts have no tax advantages, but they offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, make sure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, accessible account.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid, lower growth investments (bonds, cash) where you may want to access funds without penalties.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of your investments within each account type. For instance, placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts may be more beneficial than in taxable accounts due to capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your individual needs and objectives.
