When considering the distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as tax efficiency, investment goals, and potential growth. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match; this is essentially free money. Then, aim to max out your contributions if your financial situation allows.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, a traditional or Roth IRA can provide significant tax benefits. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when choosing between traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxed withdrawals) and Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) IRAs.

### 2. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Once you’ve maximized the contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts. This is especially important for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these will be taxed in the year they are realized.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level and to take advantage of market fluctuations.

This strategy can optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
