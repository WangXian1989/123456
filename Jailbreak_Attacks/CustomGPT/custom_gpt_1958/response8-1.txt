When deciding how to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize funding your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before fully funding taxable accounts, as they provide tax benefits that can enhance long-term growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income level, consider whether to contribute to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on your overall risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you might want to keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so tailor these suggestions to your specific needs and goals.
