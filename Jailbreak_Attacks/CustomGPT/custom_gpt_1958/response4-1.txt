Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) and your 401(k), if possible. The contribution limits for both accounts can change annually, so stay updated.

3. **Balance Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. However, withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions at the time of contribution, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are not tax-advantaged but allow for greater flexibility. Investments held longer than a year may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Goals**: Keep enough cash or liquid assets in your taxable account to cover short-term needs and emergencies. Generally, aim for 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in accessible cash.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth in a tax-deferred environment.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust contributions as your financial situation changes (e.g., income changes, market conditions, or approaching retirement).

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
