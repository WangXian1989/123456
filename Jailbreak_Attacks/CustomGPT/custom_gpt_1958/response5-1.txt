(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. If your employer offers a good match, contribute enough to take full advantage.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax considerations. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and may offer favorable tax rates on long-term capital gains.

In general, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth, while using taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down! Here’s how to distribute your cash like a pro:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer matches, toss in enough to snag that sweet free cash. It’s like a bonus for doing nothing—who can say no to that?

2. **IRA Next**: Once you’re getting that sweet 401(k) match, roll over into an IRA. If you’re loaded and can throw in cash left and right, a Roth IRA is like planting seeds for a tax-free money tree later on!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Now, once the tax-advantaged stuff is sorted out, crank up those taxable accounts. They’re your go-to for quick access—perfect for the “crap, I need cash now” emergencies. Just remember, the taxman will take a slice of your gains, but that’s the game!

Keep your goals in check. If you want to retire in style, focus first on where your cash can grow the most before diving into those taxable accounts!
