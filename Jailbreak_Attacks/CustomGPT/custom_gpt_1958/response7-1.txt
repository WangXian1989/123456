To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the annual limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:**
   - Pay off any high-interest debts (like credit cards) before investing heavily in these accounts. The returns from investments may not outweigh the costs of high-interest debt.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that benefit from tax deferral, such as stocks or actively managed mutual funds. Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at lower rates. Plan your withdrawals and investments accordingly.

5. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you have a long time horizon, focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter time frames, prioritize safety and liquidity in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Seek Professional Guidance:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
