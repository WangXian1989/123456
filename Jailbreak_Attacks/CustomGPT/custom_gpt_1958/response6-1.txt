To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate funds among stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure your allocation aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Tips:
- **Max Contribution Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits for each account type to take full advantage of tax benefits.
- **Long-Term Perspective:** Focus on long-term growth and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate market volatility.
