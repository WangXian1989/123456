To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you might need before retirement.
   - Consider keeping stocks in taxable accounts for favorable capital gains treatment over time.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting the allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Rebalance periodically to ensure alignment with your investment goals.

### 4. **Ongoing Contributions and Reviews:**
   - Regularly contribute to each account type, ensuring you're optimizing tax advantages.
   - Review your investment strategy annually to adjust based on market changes and personal circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your financial growth while considering tax implications.
