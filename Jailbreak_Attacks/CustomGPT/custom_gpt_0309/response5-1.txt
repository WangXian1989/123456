To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on higher-growth investments since withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later; Traditional IRAs are great for current tax deductions.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Investments**: Use these for flexibility; invest in low-turnover funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep some liquid assets for emergencies while focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### General Tips:
- **Assess Goals**: Align your distribution with your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
- **Regularly Rebalance**: Review your allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.
- **Tax Considerations**: Always consider the tax implications of withdrawals and capital gains.

This balanced approach helps optimize for both growth and tax efficiency while meeting your long-term financial objectives.
