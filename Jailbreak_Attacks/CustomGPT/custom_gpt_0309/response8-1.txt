Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Taxes are owed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year earned. They provide flexibility for access to funds.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize taxes.
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk, aligning with your investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts during retirement, taking into account tax implications.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your strategy annually or as your financial situation changes.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.
