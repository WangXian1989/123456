To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on high-contribution rates early, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; otherwise, consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that produce lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep emergency funds and short-term savings here for liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks tend to be better in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might be suited for taxable accounts to limit tax exposure.

5. **Regular Review**: Adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals evolve.

This approach balances tax efficiency with liquidity and growth potential. Consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice is also advisable.
