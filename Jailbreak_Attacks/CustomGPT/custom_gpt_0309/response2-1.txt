The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match** (401(k))
   - **Contribution**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide a tax deduction.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains and qualified dividends, as these are taxed at a lower rate. This includes holding individual stocks or tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in these accounts since the growth will be tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider placing bonds or high-yield investments here, as they can be more tax-efficient.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across these accounts to balance risk and return.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, consider speaking to a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth while minimizing tax liability over time.
