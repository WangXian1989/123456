Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax-advantaged growth. A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits, but Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for short-term goals and offer flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess your allocations and adjust based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Balance is key to optimizing growth while managing your tax exposure effectively!
