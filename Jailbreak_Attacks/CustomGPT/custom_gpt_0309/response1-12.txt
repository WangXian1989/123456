I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight management, and avoiding alcohol can help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis), antiviral medications or corticosteroids might be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine tests to check liver function and monitor any progression.
4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
