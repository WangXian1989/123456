Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you can still contribute after getting the match, consider contributing the maximum allowable amount, especially if you have a Roth option.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term goals and provide flexibility. However, they don’t offer the same tax advantages. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Stocks may go in taxable accounts since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate, while bonds could be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts due to their interest income being taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance, contributions, and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, it may be beneficial to consult a professional. 

This strategic approach balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential tailored to your financial situation.
