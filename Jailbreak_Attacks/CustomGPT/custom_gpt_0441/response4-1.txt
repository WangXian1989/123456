Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income in the current year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible. Withdrawals are taxable.
     - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments produce capital gains that are taxable when sold. Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If your goal is long-term growth for retirement, prioritize accounts that offer tax advantages first (like maxing out a 401(k) and IRA), then invest in taxable accounts.
   - If you might need access to funds before retirement, consider allocating more to taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across your accounts. This might mean holding different types of investments in each account based on their tax implications.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. You may want to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts, depending on your tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
