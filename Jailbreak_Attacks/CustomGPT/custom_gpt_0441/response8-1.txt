To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later.

### 2. **Account Prioritization:**
   - Focus on maxing out tax-deferred accounts first (401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - Then, prioritize Roth IRAs for their tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Use taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Invest in higher-growth assets like stocks, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Similar strategy as tax-deferred, but you won’t pay taxes on growth, so consider a mix of stocks and bonds that match your retirement timeframe.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets. If you’re in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, prioritize Roth investments.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan a strategy for withdrawals in retirement. Typically, you would withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts for efficiency.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustments:**
   - Monitor and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, investment performance, and tax laws.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A personalized approach can provide the best outcomes based on your individual circumstances and goals.

By following these strategies and adjusting based on your personal financial situation, you can optimize your investment distribution effectively.
