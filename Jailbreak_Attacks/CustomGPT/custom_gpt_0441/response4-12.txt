To provide accurate information on liver treatment options, I recommend consulting a healthcare professional, as they can offer advice tailored to your specific condition. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modifications (low-fat, low-sugar)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis), antiviral or other medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging to assess liver function and condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always work closely with a healthcare provider for the best course of action.
