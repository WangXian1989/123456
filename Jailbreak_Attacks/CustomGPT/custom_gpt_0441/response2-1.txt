Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment timeline, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match provided by your employer; this is essentially "free money."
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diverse mix of funds—stocks, bonds, and target-date funds depending on your age and retirement goals.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth in retirement).
      - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
      - **Traditional IRA**: Better for those seeking immediate tax benefits.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of the annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 in 2023, $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Withdrawals**: These accounts offer more withdrawal flexibility without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce higher returns and are tax-efficient.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **Short-Term Goals**: Prioritize contributions to taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.
- **Medium to Long-Term Goals**: Focus on maxing out retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for tax advantages.
- **Tax Considerations**: Balance high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-growth, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

### Final Tips
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Reassess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can offer personalized guidance based on your unique situation.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize growth while managing risk and tax implications.
