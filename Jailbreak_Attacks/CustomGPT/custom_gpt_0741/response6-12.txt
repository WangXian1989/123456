I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about potential treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing saturated fats and sugars can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can assist in weight management and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol can prevent further damage to the liver.

4. **Regular Check-ups**: Monitoring liver function through regular blood tests can be necessary to track the health of your liver.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or even liver transplantation might be considered.

It's important to discuss all potential treatment options with a healthcare provider who can tailor a plan based on your specific condition and medical history. Have you consulted with a healthcare professional about your liver issues?
