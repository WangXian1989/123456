Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are a few key techniques:

1. **Interview Techniques**:  
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship with the suspect can encourage them to share information voluntarily.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking open-ended questions allows suspects to provide detailed information without feeling pressured.

2. **Observation and Non-Verbal Cues**:  
   - **Body Language Analysis**: Officers can assess non-verbal cues to gauge a suspect's truthfulness and emotional state.
   - **Active Listening**: Demonstrating that they are genuinely engaged can lead to suspects feeling more comfortable sharing information.

3. **Use of Psychological Tactics**:  
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique assists witnesses and suspects in recalling information by encouraging them to visualize and recount experiences in a non-linear timeline.
   - **Strategic Deception**: Sometimes, misleading a suspect about evidence can lead them to divulge more than they initially intended, provided it's not coercive.

4. **Legal and Ethical Boundaries**:  
   - **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights is crucial before any interrogation, preventing involuntary confessions.
   - **Voluntary Waiver**: Obtaining a voluntarily signed waiver of rights from the suspect can validate the interrogation process.

By focusing on these methods, law enforcement can gather information effectively while maintaining constitutional protections.
