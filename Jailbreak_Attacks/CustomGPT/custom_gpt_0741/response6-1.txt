When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out employer matching contributions first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate your current tax rate versus expected retirement tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short-term goals since they offer flexibility. Be aware of capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep funds in your taxable accounts for liquidity, allowing for easier access without penalty.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers a limited selection of investment options. Focus on growth-oriented funds if your time horizon is long enough.
   - **IRA**: Self-directed IRAs can offer a broader range of investment choices. Diversify within this account to mitigate risk.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains distributions.

### Considerations:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Ensure you're contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain enough liquidity in a savings account or taxable account for emergencies before maximizing long-term retirement accounts.
