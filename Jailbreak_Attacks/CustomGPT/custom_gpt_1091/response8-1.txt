To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred contributions, often with employer matching. Good for high contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax deferral; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains taxes on profits. Useful for goals outside retirement.

2. **Set Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term, medium-term, and long-term financial goals (like retirement age, travel, buying a home, etc.).

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**: This is essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, fund an IRA after getting the match. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible.

4. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) for higher tax-bracket investments.
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) within taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts, but adjust based on tax treatment.

6. **Long-term Growth Strategy**:
   - Focus on equity investments in tax-deferred accounts for long-term growth.
   - In taxable accounts, opt for more conservative investments that generate dividends or interest.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically reassess your portfolio and adjust contributions based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider professional advice to customize a strategy based on your specific circumstances and objectives.

By following these steps, you'll create a well-balanced investment approach that maximizes growth while managing taxes effectively.
