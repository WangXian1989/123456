Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your income level, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** If you have maxed out your contributions to retirement accounts, consider setting aside funds in taxable accounts. These can be more flexible and allow for quicker access to funds without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains:** Be mindful of potential capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Long-term investments may incur lower tax rates.

### 3. **Balance Growth and Stability**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your investment choices reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon. A more aggressive approach might suit younger investors, while those closer to retirement may prioritize stability.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your financial goals.

### 4. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically review and adjust the allocation to maintain your desired risk level as markets fluctuate.
   - **Stay Informed:** Keep track of changes in tax laws and investment opportunities.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice specific to your situation.
