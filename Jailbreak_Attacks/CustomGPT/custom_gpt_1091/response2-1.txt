To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement; otherwise, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income. Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Investment Strategies**
   - **401(k):** Focus on a diversified mix of funds, often offered as target-date funds if you're unsure.
   - **IRA:** Consider alternative investments or low-cost index funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement for tax efficiency, often starting withdrawals from taxable accounts first.

### 6. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If in doubt, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your financial picture.

By strategically distributing your funds among these accounts, you can optimize for growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
