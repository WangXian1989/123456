Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Treatments**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for higher earners anticipating a lower tax rate in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Both Traditional (pre-tax contributions) and Roth (post-tax contributions) IRAs offer tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you’ll face capital gains taxes on any investment growth, but they offer more liquidity and flexibility without contribution limits.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have adequate savings in a high-yield savings account for emergencies before directing funds into retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes within each account to balance growth and risk. 

5. **Adjust Contributions Over Time**: As your income or expenses change, revisit your contribution strategy. You might need to shift more funds to tax-efficient investments based on your situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help align your investment strategy with your financial goals and tax situation.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money among your retirement and taxable accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
