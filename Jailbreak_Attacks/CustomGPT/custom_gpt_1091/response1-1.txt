Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match first. Then, aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible. This helps reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Once you’ve maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and eligibility.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) or IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income. Taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may produce high capital gains or income. Be mindful of tax efficiency (consider tax-loss harvesting and investing in index funds).

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses, ideally in a high-yield savings account or similar.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and geographies in all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to adjust for changes in the market or your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

Balancing your investments wisely can lead to optimal growth while minimizing taxes over time.
