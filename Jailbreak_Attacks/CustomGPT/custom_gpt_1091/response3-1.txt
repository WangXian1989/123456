To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand account types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, useful for tax-advantaged savings. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investment accounts subject to capital gains tax when you sell assets.

2. **Assess your goals**:
   - Determine your time horizon (short-term vs. long-term).
   - Identify your risk tolerance (conservative vs. aggressive).

3. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - If eligible, max out contributions to your IRA (consider Roth vs. Traditional based on current and expected future tax rates).
   
4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, and cash) within each account to reduce risk.
   - Consider using a target-date fund in retirement accounts for a set-it-and-forget-it approach.

5. **Tax efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate less taxable income.

6. **Regular review and rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation as your goals, market conditions, and account balances change.
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired risk levels.

7. **Consult a financial advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help align your distribution strategy with your financial goals and tax situation.

By following this approach, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
