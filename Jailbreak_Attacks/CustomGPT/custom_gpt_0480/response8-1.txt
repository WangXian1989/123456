To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial for growing your investments tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, with taxes due on withdrawals.
     - Roth IRAs allow for after-tax contributions, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income (dividends, interest, capital gains) is taxed in the year it is realized.

2. **Investment Horizons**:
   - Longer-term investments (e.g., stocks, index funds) are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) because you can defer taxes on their growth.
   - Shorter-term savings (e.g., bonds, cash) might be better suited for taxable accounts due to lower tax rates on capital gains.

3. **Account Limitations**:
   - Understand contribution limits: 
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50 in 2023).
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - Take full advantage of employer matches in your 401(k) before contributing heavily to IRAs.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts for risk management.

5. **Contribution Strategy**:
   - If maximizing tax benefits is your goal, start by maxing out contributions in your 401(k) (especially if there's a match), followed by your IRA, and then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when to withdraw funds in retirement, considering the tax implications of each account type.

It's generally advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
