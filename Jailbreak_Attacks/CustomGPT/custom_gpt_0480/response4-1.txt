To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth. Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, but withdrawals are taxed; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals on qualified distributions. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you might need access to in the short term. Consider tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs.

2. **Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices, such as mutual funds. Focus on low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Offers a broader range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs. This flexibility can help optimize returns.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for higher-risk investments since you can manage capital gains and losses more flexibly.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for when and how you will withdraw from each account type during retirement. For example, start with taxable accounts to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive growth investments in accounts with a longer time horizon, like your 401(k) or IRA, while reserving safer investments for your taxable accounts if you plan to access them sooner.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts up to their limits. For 2024, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 catch-up for those 50 and older) and $7,000 for IRAs (plus $1,000 catch-up).

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target asset allocation as different accounts may grow at varying rates.

7. **Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. 

Implementing these steps can help create a balanced and effective distribution strategy among your retirement accounts.
