I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Medication**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Medications to reduce liver inflammation.
   - Supplements like milk thistle, discussed for liver health (though consult your doctor first).

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol, high-fat, and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgical Options**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific situation.
