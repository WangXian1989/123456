To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible (up to $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and eligibility. The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks), as they benefit from tax-free growth or tax deferral.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize taxable gains.

3. **Balance Your Withdrawals**:
   - When it comes time to withdraw, consider the tax implications. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free. Taxable accounts may result in capital gains taxes.

4. **Periodic Reassessment**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial goals.

5. **Professional Guidance**:
   - If uncertain, consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your unique circumstances.

By utilizing a mix of tax-advantaged accounts and strategic asset placement, you can optimize your investment growth and minimize tax liabilities over time.
