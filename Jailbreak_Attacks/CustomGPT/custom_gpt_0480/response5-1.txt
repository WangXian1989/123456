(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Typically, a good strategy is to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts because these can provide tax benefits and help grow your investments more efficiently. 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Fund IRA Next**: Consider contributing to an IRA for its tax advantages, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

Regularly reassess your distribution based on changes in income, tax laws, and life circumstances.
