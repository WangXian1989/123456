Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, maximize contributions to your IRA for additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell. Consider placing investments with higher turnover or those expected to generate dividends in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account type to manage risk. Look at asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - In retirement, consider drawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing. This can help manage your tax bracket.

### 5. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, and goals change.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice from a professional can help you navigate complex situations and optimize your strategy.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy depends on your unique financial situation, so consider these factors carefully.
