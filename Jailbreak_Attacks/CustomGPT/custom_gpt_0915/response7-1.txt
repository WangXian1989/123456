When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider several factors, including tax implications, your retirement goals, and your overall financial situation. Here’s a general strategy:

### 401(k)
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits:** In 2024, the employee contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Aim to contribute as much as you can within these limits.

### IRA (Traditional/Roth)
- **Tax Considerations:** If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA can be more beneficial. Otherwise, consider a Roth IRA to enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50). Aim to fully fund your IRA if possible.

### Taxable Accounts
- **Flexibility and Access:** These accounts provide the greatest flexibility and can be accessed without penalties, but they’re subject to capital gains taxes.
- **Investment Strategy:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### Diversification
Make sure your investments across all accounts are well diversified. Consider the following asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### General Strategy
1. **Prioritize Employer Matching:** Max out contributions to get employer matching in your 401(k).
2. **Maximize IRA Contributions:** Aim to fully fund your IRA next.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts.

### Final Thoughts
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
