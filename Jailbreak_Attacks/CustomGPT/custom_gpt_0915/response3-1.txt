To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps and strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax advantages; often includes matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Personal retirement account that can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on gains and dividends.

2. **Set Your Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement age, lifestyle expectations, and any other financial goals (e.g., purchasing a home, education).

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to obtain any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you prefer tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not fit into tax-advantaged accounts or as a source of liquidity.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for high-growth investments to defer taxes.
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Risk Assessment**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is adequately diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Seek Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution to meet your long-term financial goals while managing tax implications effectively.
