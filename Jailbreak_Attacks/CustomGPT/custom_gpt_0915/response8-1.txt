Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, maximize contributions up to the IRS limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account or other liquid assets before heavily investing.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth will be sheltered from taxes. 

5. **Rebalance**: Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Long-Term and Short-Term Goals**: Match the investment accounts to your financial goals. Use 401(k) and IRAs for long-term retirement savings while using taxable accounts for more liquid, short-term needs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

Always consider your individual circumstances, including your tax bracket and retirement goals, when making these decisions.
