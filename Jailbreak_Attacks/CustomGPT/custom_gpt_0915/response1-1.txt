Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if youâ€™re getting match benefits. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you max out tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for flexible withdrawals and investing in assets like stocks and bonds without tax penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance:
   - Long-term investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Short-term investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for market fluctuations.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
