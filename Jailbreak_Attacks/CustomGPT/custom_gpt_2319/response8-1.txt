Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts can provide tax deductions or tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in the long run.

3. **Diversification of Investment Options**: Each account type may offer different investment options. Consider how they work together to create a diverse portfolio across different asset classes and sectors.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your future withdrawal strategy. Withdrawals from taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Plan out how and when you might need to access these funds in retirement.

5. **Age Considerations**: If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to be more conservative with investments in your 401(k) and IRA, focusing on preserving capital while still aiming for growth. If you’re younger, you may want to take on more risk for higher potential returns.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Review your asset allocation regularly or at least annually to adjust for changes in the market, your lifestyle, or your financial goals.

7. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**: If you have complex financial needs or goals, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

It's essential to have a strategy that aligns with your financial objectives and risk tolerance while taking advantage of the benefits of each account type.
