The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and REITs) into tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA since you wonâ€™t pay taxes on dividends and interest until you withdraw the funds. Conversely, place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in your taxable account since they incur lower capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over age 50).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit for traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over age 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no limits on how much you can invest, but keep in mind the tax implications of each transaction.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified. This means looking at the combined asset allocation across all accounts rather than treating them separately.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your future withdrawal strategy. Withdrawals from taxable accounts are typically taxed differently than withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts. Planning this ahead of time can help minimize tax burdens in retirement.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Your situation can change due to income fluctuations, changes in retirement goals, market conditions, or tax laws. Regularly review and adjust your allocation as needed.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals. They can help create a tailored strategy that considers your risk tolerance, time horizon, and other personal factors.
