Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After the employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its limit, especially if you want to reduce your taxable income.

### 3. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Rates**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions to lock in your tax rate now.
   - If you think you’ll be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA could be more beneficial.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Keep in mind tax efficiency; opt for investments that generate lower short-term capital gains, like index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Balancing your contributions among these accounts thoughtfully can help you optimize your growth potential and minimize tax liabilities. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
