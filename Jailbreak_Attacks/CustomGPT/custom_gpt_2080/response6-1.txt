Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations related to your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if your income allows, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep liquidity needs in mind. Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments**: Favor stocks or equity-focused funds in retirement accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Income Investments**: Bonds or income-generating assets may be better suited for taxable accounts, where interest is taxed annually.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Withdrawals**: Be strategic about withdrawals. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
   - **Capital Gains**: Manage investment turnover in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Summary
- **Maximize contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- **Diversify investments** according to your risk tolerance and time frame.
- **Regularly reassess** your distribution strategy as financial goals and tax laws evolve.
