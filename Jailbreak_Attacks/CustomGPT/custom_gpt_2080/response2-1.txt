Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fully Fund an IRA**: Consider prioritizing contributions to an IRA, especially if it offers tax advantages (traditional or Roth).

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and contribute as much as you can, up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This way, you have more liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Balance your investments based on tax implications. For instance, place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
