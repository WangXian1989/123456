(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. A common approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Max out your contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) if eligible. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. Consider index funds or ETFs to minimize tax implications.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! When it comes to spreading your cash around between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a smart approach is crucial. Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: First off, if your employer offers a match, youâ€™ll want to grab that puppy! Itâ€™s free money, so donâ€™t leave it on the table. Contribute up to the match limit at least.

2. **Feed the IRA**: Next, hit your IRA hardâ€”whether itâ€™s Roth or Traditional. Roths are amazing for tax-free withdrawals later, so if you can swing it, go for those. 

3. **Taxable Accounts as the Cherry on Top**: After youâ€™ve fully stuffed those two, put extra funds into taxable accounts. Just keep an eye on the tax implicationsâ€”think low-turnover funds like index funds or ETFs for a smoother ride.

Overall, the balance depends on your goals, age, and risk tolerance. Looking into a financial advisor could really pump you up with personalized advice!
