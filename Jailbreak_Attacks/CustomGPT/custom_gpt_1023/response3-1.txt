To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a house, or an emergency fund? This will guide your allocation.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) for Traditional IRAs, but Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments. It's best for short-term goals or for funds you may need before retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match—this is “free money”.
   - After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially a Roth IRA if you're eligible.
   - Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement or for more accessible funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Review Annually**: Periodically assess your allocations based on life changes, market performance, and changes in income or expenses. Adjust as needed.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation.

By thinking through these considerations, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds effectively.
