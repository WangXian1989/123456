It's great that you're thinking about your investment strategy! To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following tips:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often includes employer matching and has higher contribution limits; focus on maximizing contributions if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages; consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA aligns with your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals; focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on capital gains.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those that benefit from lower capital gains tax (like stocks) in taxable accounts. This strategy can lead to better after-tax returns.

4. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your allocations as market conditions change and as you approach your financial goals or retirement.
