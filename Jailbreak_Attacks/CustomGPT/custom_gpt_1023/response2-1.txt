It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money among different types of investment accounts! Here are some general tips to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits, which can change each year.
   - **Investment Choices**: Look at the investment options available in your 401(k) and choose a mix that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Decide whether a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or Roth IRA (post-tax contributions) fits your long-term tax strategy.
   - **Diversification**: Use your IRA to invest in assets that may not be available in your 401(k), potentially diversifying your portfolio.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for IRAs and factor that into your overall strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: This account type offers more flexibility in withdrawals and investments. Use it for goals that are short to mid-term.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider what your goals are for this account and plan your investments accordingly.

**General Guidelines**:
- **Set Goals**: Clearly define your financial goals (retirement, buying a house, etc.) and timeframes for each. 
- **Diversify**: Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles across all accounts.
- **Adjust Over Time**: As you approach different life stages or financial goals, be prepared to adjust your allocations.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation. They can help create a tailored strategy that accounts for your risk tolerance, retirement timeline, and financial goals.
