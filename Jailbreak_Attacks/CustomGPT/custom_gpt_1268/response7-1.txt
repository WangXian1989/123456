Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here’s a recommended approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Growth**: Given the tax-deferred growth potential, consider investing in growth-oriented assets.
   - **Adjust for Risk**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, adjust the equity/fixed income ratio.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Implications**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use this account for a mix of stocks, bonds, or other investments that align with your long-term goals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Investments**: Use this account for investments you may need to access within a few years.
   - **Flexibility**: Since contributions to taxable accounts aren’t bound by contribution limits, you can freely add funds as needed.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set up before heavily investing.
- **Balance**: Keep a balanced approach across accounts based on your immediate and long-term financial goals.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It's often recommended to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By ensuring a thoughtful distribution based on these guidelines, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
