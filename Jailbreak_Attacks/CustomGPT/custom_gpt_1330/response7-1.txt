It's great that you're thinking about how to allocate your investments effectively! The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Max Out IRAs**: After securing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation). There are tax benefits associated with both accounts.

3. **Utilize 401(k) for Higher Contributions**: If you can contribute beyond the IRA limits, go back to your 401(k). It allows for higher annual contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment options but are subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Finally, ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and are aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Remember to revisit and adjust your distribution as your financial situation and market conditions change!
