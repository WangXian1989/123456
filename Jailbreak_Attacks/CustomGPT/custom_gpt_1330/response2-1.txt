When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to factor in various aspects, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket or expecting to be in a lower bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can provide tax deduction benefits, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Depending on your income, consider your eligibility for each type.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These funds offer flexibility as they are not subject to the same withdrawal restrictions as retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your distribution with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Higher-risk investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth accounts).
   - **Asset Location**: Place your more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before committing all your disposable income to investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often helpful to speak with a financial advisor who can offer personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

This strategy can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances, so itâ€™s wise to tailor it to your own needs.
