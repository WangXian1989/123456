To provide you with tailored advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I'll need a bit more information. Could you please answer the following questions?

1. What are your financial goals (e.g., retirement savings, buying a home, etc.)?
2. What is your current age and when do you plan to retire?
3. Are you currently contributing to your 401(k) and IRA? If so, how much?
4. What is your risk tolerance? (low, medium, high)
5. Are there any employer matching contributions for your 401(k)?
6. What is your current tax bracket?

These details will help me provide a more accurate and personalized suggestion.
