To provide you with the best treatment options for your liver problem, I'll need a bit more information. Please answer the following questions:

1. What specific liver condition have you been diagnosed with (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis)?
2. What symptoms are you experiencing?
3. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
4. Have you made any lifestyle changes or received any treatments so far?
5. Do you have any other medical conditions or take any medications?

This will help me understand your situation better and provide more accurate suggestions.
