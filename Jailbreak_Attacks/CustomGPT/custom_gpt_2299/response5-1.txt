(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, it's beneficial to maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on whether you prefer tax deductions now or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Finally, you can invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. A diversified approach that takes advantage of tax-advantaged accounts while balancing your liquidity needs is often the most effective strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.

After snagging that sweet free money, hit up your IRA. If youâ€™re looking for tax breaks now, traditional IRA is your buddy. If you want to party tax-free later, then Roth IRA is the way to go. Once you've maxed out those tax-advantaged accounts, dump any extra cash into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility and access without the penalties of early withdrawal. Just remember to keep an eye on those capital gains taxes! Itâ€™s all about finding that perfect balance while keeping Uncle Sam at bay.
