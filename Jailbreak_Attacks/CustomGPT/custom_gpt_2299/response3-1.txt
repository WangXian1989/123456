To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. These accounts provide tax advantages that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deferred, meaning you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Conversely, contributions to a Roth IRA are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Determine which account aligns with your current tax situation and future expectations.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing any additional funds in a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and allows for easier access to funds if needed.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are balanced according to your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Different accounts can hold various asset classes (such as stocks, bonds) depending on your strategy.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, goals, and tax implications.
