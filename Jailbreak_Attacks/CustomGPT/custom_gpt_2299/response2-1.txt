When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts don’t provide tax benefits on contributions, but capital gains and dividends could be taxed at lower rates.

2. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to maximize that free money first. This is often considered the best first step.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 catch-up if you’re over 50) and $6,500 for traditional and Roth IRAs (plus $1,000 catch-up).

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: 
   - Consider your future withdrawal needs. Taxable accounts allow for easier access without penalties, while retirement accounts impose penalties if withdrawals are made before age 59½ (with some exceptions).

5. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Some accounts may be better suited for higher-risk investments compared to others.

6. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place higher tax-burdened investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

7. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts to manage risk appropriately.

Tailoring your strategy based on these factors will help optimize your investment across each type of account. If you want more specific recommendations based on your situation, feel free to provide additional details!
