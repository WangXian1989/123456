To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** After maximizing employer contributions, consider maxing out your IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Funds you might need in the near future should go into taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, as they offer compounding benefits without immediate tax implications.
