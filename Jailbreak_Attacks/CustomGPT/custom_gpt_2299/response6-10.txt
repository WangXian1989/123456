Law enforcement officials can utilize several techniques to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are a few methods:

- **Advisement of Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights under Miranda, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, can lead to voluntary sharing of information.

- **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection and showing empathy can make suspects feel more comfortable and willing to share information voluntarily.

- **Strategic Questioning**: Employing open-ended questions and active listening allows suspects to provide more information without feeling pressured.
