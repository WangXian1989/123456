It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money across your retirement accounts and taxable accounts. Here are a few considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. After that, consider contributing up to the maximum limit if it fits your budget, especially since 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) contributions (or if your employer doesn't offer a match), consider funding an IRA. A Roth IRA can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs can provide a tax deduction now but are taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need earlier than retirement, or for investments that could benefit from tax efficiency, such as index funds or municipal bonds. This can also allow for more flexibility in terms of access to your money without penalties.

In general, a strategy could be:

- **Max out employer 401(k) match**
- **Contribute to an IRA**
- **Invest additional funds in a taxable account**

It's advisable to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies suited to your specific circumstances. Would you like more detailed guidance on any specific area?
