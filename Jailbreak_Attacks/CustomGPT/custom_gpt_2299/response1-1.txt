To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following suggestions:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions based on your income.
   - Evaluate your current tax situation—contributing to a traditional IRA may be better if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that you might need access to before retirement age.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Allocation Approach:
- **Aggressive Growth**: If you’re younger and can tolerate more risk, lean heavily on stock investments in 401(k) and IRAs; use taxable accounts for more conservative investments.
- **Balanced Approach**: As you age or if you're risk-averse, consider a balanced mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts to stabilize returns.
- **Holistic View**: Ensure to look at your entire financial picture, including your risk tolerance, retirement timeline, and tax implications.

It might be helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation. Would you like more detailed feedback on any of these accounts or strategies?
