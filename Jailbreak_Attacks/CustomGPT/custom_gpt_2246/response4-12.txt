I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on common treatment options for liver problems. However, it's crucial that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver function.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and blood tests may be necessary to monitor liver function and adjust treatments as needed.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation might be considered, especially for end-stage liver disease.

5. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: If your liver problem is related to conditions like diabetes or obesity, managing those conditions effectively can improve liver health.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment for your specific condition.
