Determining the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) regarding taxation on contributions and withdrawals. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits, and interest/dividends are taxable as income.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Benefits:**
   - Contribute enough to your **401(k)** to get any employer match. This is effectively free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - Consider maxing out your **IRA** contributions ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older) next, especially if you can contribute to a Roth IRA.
   - After maxing out your IRAs, go back to your **401(k)** up to the contribution limit ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).

### 4. **Diversification of Accounts:**
   - Hold more growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments, as they allow for better tax management.

### 5. **Assess Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep liquid funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as withdrawals from retirement accounts often come with penalties before age 59½.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, financial goals, and market conditions.

**Final Note**: It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure you’re making informed decisions.
