Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often lowers your taxable income. Consider maxing this out first, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts. This provides security and reduces the need to pull from accounts prematurely.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible in terms of withdrawals and investing options. Invest here after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Allocate funds appropriately across the accounts, keeping in mind the specific tax implications of each.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
