Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, try to maximize the contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be advantageous in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are earned, but long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. Consider holding investments with high growth potential in these accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts due to their lower turnover and capital gains distributions.
   - Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in 401(k) or IRA accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

4. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**:
   - Younger investors may focus more on growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement might prioritize maximizing income and minimizing taxes.
   - Reassess your strategy periodically to reflect changes in your career, income, and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, helping you optimize your investment strategy across all accounts.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
