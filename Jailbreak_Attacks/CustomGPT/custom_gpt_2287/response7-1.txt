When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, focus on this first. The contributions reduce your taxable income, and the money grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth but may offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.
   - Be mindful of tax implications when selling investments in these accounts, focusing on long-term capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. Different accounts can hold various asset types (e.g., stocks, bonds) based on tax efficiency.
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) are better suited for taxable accounts, while tax-inefficient (like bonds) may be better in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Plan contributions and withdrawals based on your current and expected future tax brackets. 

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances and goals.
