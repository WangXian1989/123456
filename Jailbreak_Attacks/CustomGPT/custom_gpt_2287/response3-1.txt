Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current and expected future tax rates. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After getting the match, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if your employer plan has good investment options and lower fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you plan to access the money before retirement age. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Fees and Taxes**: Keep an eye on the expense ratios of your investment options, and be aware of tax implications for capital gains in taxable accounts.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
