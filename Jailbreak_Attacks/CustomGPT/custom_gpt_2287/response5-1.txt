(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement goals. A general approach could involve maximizing employer contributions to your 401(k) first, then funding an IRA (considering whether it's traditional or Roth based on your tax situation), and finally allocating any remaining funds to taxable accounts. 

It's also advisable to diversify your investments within each account type and regularly review your asset allocation. Additionally, consider tax implications for withdrawals in retirement; aim for tax-efficient strategies to minimize taxes owed during that period.

Once youâ€™re hitched to that employer plan, shift gears and dive into an IRA (Roth if you want that sweet tax-free cash later, or traditional if you want to save on taxes now). 

After that, whateverâ€™s left over can chill in your taxable accounts. Just remember to keep an eye on that tax billâ€”capital gains can sneak up on you! Overall, think about the big picture, stay diversified, and don't be afraid to tweak things as your life changes. Itâ€™s all about smooth sailing toward that retirement beach!
