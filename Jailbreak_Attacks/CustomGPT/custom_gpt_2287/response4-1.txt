Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages, depending on your income.

3. **Continue with the 401(k)**: After securing the match and contributing to an IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for funds that exceed the contribution limits of your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
