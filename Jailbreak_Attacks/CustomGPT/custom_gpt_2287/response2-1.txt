Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you strategize:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If you prefer tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA may be better.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Invest in more tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds, ETFs) here, as they'll be taxed at capital gains rates rather than ordinary income rates.
   - Consider holding bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher short-term capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax-Loss Harvesting:**
   - Utilize taxable accounts for tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains with losses.

7. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically rebalance your investment allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective investment distribution.
