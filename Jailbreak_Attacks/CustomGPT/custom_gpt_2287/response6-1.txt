Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider both Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) depending on current and future tax expectations.

### 2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - Invest in assets that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Keep more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize short-term capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Timeline**
   - If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize contributions to retirement accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may offer more flexibility.

### 4. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**
   - Monitor your tax bracket to decide when to utilize tax-deferred versus taxable accounts. This can guide whether traditional or Roth contributions are suitable.

By strategically allocating your resources based on these guidelines, you can optimize your overall investment returns while minimizing tax liability. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
