Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k)—the contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). A Roth IRA is typically beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) or traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals if the account has been open for at least five years and you're at least 59½ years old.
   - Taxable accounts offer less tax protection, but they allow for more flexibility with withdrawals and may be beneficial for short-term savings.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Your investment strategy should align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, a mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs is advisable.
   - Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in market conditions or your personal financial situation.

By carefully balancing contributions across these accounts while considering tax implications and investment choices, you can create an effective strategy for managing your retirement savings.

### Summary:
- Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, focusing on 401(k) and IRA.
- Be aware of tax implications when choosing where to invest your money.
- Diversify your investment portfolio and regularly review your strategy.
