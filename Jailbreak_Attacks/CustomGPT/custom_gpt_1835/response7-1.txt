(Î±) When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you might consider the following guidelines: 

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts can provide significant tax benefits.

2. **Diversify across account types**: It's a good idea to have a mix of account types since they are taxed differently. 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while taxable accounts will be taxed on any capital gains or dividends you receive.

3. **Consider your investment horizon and risk tolerance**: Longer-term investments may benefit from being placed in tax-advantaged accounts to grow without the burden of immediate taxes. 

By following these tips, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy.

- **Summary:**
  - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
  - Diversify your investments across different account types.
  - Tailor your strategy to your financial goals and risk tolerance.
