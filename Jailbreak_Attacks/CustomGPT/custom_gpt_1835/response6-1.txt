Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money). Aim to max out your contributions if you can. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings to taxable accounts. This allows more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Keep lower-growth or more tax-efficient investments (like bonds or index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Summary:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings after maxing tax-advantaged options.
- Strategically place different assets to optimize tax efficiency.
