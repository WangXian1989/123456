Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you:

1. **401(k) Accounts:** 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket since contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts:** 
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRA contributions can be tax-deductible, making them beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket currently.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** 
   - Use these for any additional investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, for long-term growth.

4. **Consider Your Timeline:**
   - If you're closer to retirement, focus on 401(k) and IRA accounts for tax benefits.
   - For younger investors, taxable accounts can be great for building wealth that isn't tied up until retirement.

5. **Diversification is Key:**
   - Allocate funds based on diversification strategies suitable for your risk tolerance, ensuring your portfolio is balanced across all three account types.

As financial situations are unique, consulting with a financial advisor is often beneficial to create a personalized strategy.

### Summary:
- Prioritize employer-matched contributions in your 401(k).
- Max out IRAs for tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for extra investments and wealth building.
