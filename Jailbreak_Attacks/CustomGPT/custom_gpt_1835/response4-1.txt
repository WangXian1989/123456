Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial depending on your projected income.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts provide flexibility but come with tax implications for capital gains and dividends. Consider utilizing these accounts for investments that produce dividends or gains that you can manage for tax efficiency, like tax-exempt bonds or long-term investments.

4. **Invest for Growth vs. Income**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, decide how much to allocate to growth-oriented investments in your retirement accounts (like stocks) and how much to allocate to income-generating investments in your taxable accounts (like bonds).

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as your financial situation, risk tolerance, or market conditions change.

### Summary:
- Maximize employer contributions to your 401(k) for free money.
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs after your 401(k) match.
