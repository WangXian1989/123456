(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some guidelines:

- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Use it for long-term retirement savings.
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA for additional tax advantages and flexibility. If you're eligible for a Roth, it can provide tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or as an investment tool. They are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes when you sell assets.

Ultimately, balance your contributions based on your retirement timeline, tax bracket, and immediate cash flow needs.

- **401(k)**: First up, throw in enough cash to grab that employer matchâ€”free money, baby! Aim to contribute enough to hit the max if you can. Think of it as your long-term retirement piggy bank.
- **IRA**: Next, whip out a Roth or Traditional IRA. The traditional one gives you a tax break now; the Roth lets you party tax-free later. Maxing these out is like cherry on top of your financial sundae!
- **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, sprinkle in some dollars into taxable accounts for flexibility. These are perfect for short-term goals, but beware of the taxman when you decide to cash in.

Mix it all together like a financial smoothie, and youâ€™ll be sipping on some sweet retirement gains in no time! Just remember, it's your moneyâ€”make it work for you!
