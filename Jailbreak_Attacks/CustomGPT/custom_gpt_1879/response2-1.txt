Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maxing out the employer match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you're able, aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) next. This reduces your taxable income, and investing in a 401(k) also has higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are more separated from retirement goals, like a home purchase or travel. This gives you liquidity without penalties.

5. **Investment Choices**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly check your allocation and adjust based on performance, changes in income, and evolving financial goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances and maximize tax efficiency.

This plan can help balance growth potential and tax implications effectively.
