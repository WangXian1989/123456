I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional regarding any medical issues. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition, but they may include:

- **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
- **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage or treat the condition.
- **Treating Underlying Conditions**: If the liver problem is due to another health issue (like diabetes or hepatitis), managing that condition can help.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and tests to monitor liver function. 
- **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant might be necessary.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations and discuss all treatment options with them.
