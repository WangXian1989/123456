Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you can follow:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more suitable. Conversely, if you expect your tax rate to increase, a Roth IRA could be advantageous.

4. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, although they are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk and optimize returns.

6. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

7. **Consider Professional Advice:**
   - If unsure, consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

This strategy helps balance growth, tax efficiency, and flexibility in managing your investments.
