Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribute enough** to get the full employer match in your 401(k). This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Great for current tax savings but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals (including gains) are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **After Tax Contributions**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for additional savings and flexibility. You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but they're more accessible for non-retirement goals.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk—stocks in growth accounts, bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw from each account type in retirement to minimize taxes. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then focus on tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Roth IRA**: If eligible, prioritize funding this for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or if you're already maxing out IRA/401(k).

### Conclusion
Tailor your contributions based on goals, tax implications, and employer offers. Regularly reassess your strategy as your financial situation changes. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights.
