Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your goals, current income, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a guide to help you decide:

### General Guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributing to a **traditional IRA** or 401(k) can provide immediate tax benefits by reducing your taxable income.
   - Use **taxable accounts** for money you'll need in the short term or to have more flexibility.

3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re saving for retirement, focus more on the 401(k) and IRA.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might incur frequent buying/selling, like real estate or stocks, as capital gains taxes could apply.

4. **Balance Risk and Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments between accounts. Don’t put all your high-risk assets in one account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:

- **401(k):** 15-20% of income (max out employer match).
- **IRA:** Contribution limits (current limit is $6,500 per year for individuals under 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts; use for short-term goals or specific investments.

### Final Considerations:

- Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and to stay updated on tax laws.
- Monitor your investment performance and make adjustments as needed.

Doing this will help you create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
