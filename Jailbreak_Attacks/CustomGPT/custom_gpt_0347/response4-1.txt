Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - Next, contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth), up to the annual limit.
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for assets that may grow significantly, such as stocks or high-growth mutual funds.
   - Consider holding bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep cash or highly liquid investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs.
   - Long-term growth investments work better in retirement accounts where they can compound without immediate tax implications.

### Example Allocation
1. **401(k)**: 50% (maximize match)
2. **IRA**: 20% (up to limit)
3. **Taxable Account**: 30% (after maxing tax-advantaged accounts)

### Regular Review
- Reassess your allocation annually based on changes in income, tax laws, or life circumstances.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
