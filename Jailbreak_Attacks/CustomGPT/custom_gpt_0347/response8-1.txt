Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred growth, possible matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement account, tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth) growth, contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals, subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
   - **Max Out IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA after your 401(k) match, especially if it’s a Roth (for tax-free growth).

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - Use **tax-deferred accounts** for higher-income investments (bonds, REITs) to avoid immediate income tax.
   - Invest in **tax-efficient funds** in taxable accounts (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 4. **Diversification & Risk**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Adjust risk based on your timeline and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically assess your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions. Rebalance as needed.

This strategy can help you maximize tax efficiency while preparing for retirement. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
