Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic considerations. Hereâ€™s a guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match. This is effectively free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Taxable Investments**: Once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, invest additional funds in taxable accounts. Use tax-efficient investment strategies, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts. Your risk tolerance and investment horizon should guide this distribution.

### 6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your specific situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your salary (up to company match).
- **IRA**: $6,500 (2023 limit for those under 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds after maxing out above accounts.

Adjust percentages based on your financial goals and time horizon.
