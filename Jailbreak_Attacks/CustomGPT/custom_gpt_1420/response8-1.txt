Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a general strategy to help guide you:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - After maximizing your employer match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - Once you’ve contributed to your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit, especially for pre-tax or Roth options, depending on your tax strategy.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement, such as for emergencies or significant purchases. Be mindful of tax implications from capital gains.

### 5. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes, while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments.

### 6. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - Be aware of the tax implications of each account type. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as income, while capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at a lower rate.

### 7. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Regularly review your strategy and adjust according to changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

Each person’s financial situation is unique, so it’s important to tailor the distribution to fit your needs and objectives.
