To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income and tax situation, prioritize IRA contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - **Tax-inefficient Investments:** Place bonds and REITs in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on interest or dividends.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments:** Keep stocks or index funds in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Ensure you're aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and prioritize funding to maximize growth opportunities.

### 4. **Review Your Investment Goals:**
   - Align your asset allocation in each account based on your time horizon, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

Regularly review your strategy and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations.
