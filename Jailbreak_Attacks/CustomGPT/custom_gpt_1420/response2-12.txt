I'm not able to provide personalized medical advice. However, I can share some general treatment options for liver issues, which may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight loss, and regular exercise can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In cases of severe liver disease, surgical options such as liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Avoidance of Alcohol and Toxins**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol consumption and exposure to harmful substances.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
