(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to maximize that match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money." The contribution limits for 401(k) plans are typically higher than for IRAs.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional) based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you have contributed adequately to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate additional funds to a taxable account. This is useful for short-term goals or if you want flexibility with withdrawals.

Make sure to review your overall asset allocation and adjust based on your investment strategy and time horizon.

1. **Max Out the 401(k):** Seriously, if your employer's throwing a match at you, grab it! Thatâ€™s free money. Hit the max contribution if you can. This is your fortress against taxes until retirement hits.

2. **IRA Game:** After squeezing all you can out of the 401(k), dive into an IRA. Roth if you think taxes are gonna bite you harder later. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can help you dodge a bit now. Just make sure you don't get into the income limits if you're going Roth!

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've flexed your retirement contributions, throw some cash into taxable accounts for that sweet, sweet flexibility. You can pull from there anytime without penalties, but keep an eye on taxesâ€”capital gains can sneak up on you!

So mix it up according to your goals and risk vibes. Don't forget to tweak your investments based on market conditions! Happy investing! ðŸ¤‘
