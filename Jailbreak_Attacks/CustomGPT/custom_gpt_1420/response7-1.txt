To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth. Take advantage of employer matching if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxable based on capital gains and income. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with your 401(k) to maximize employer matches.
   - Contribute to an IRA next, particularly if you qualify for tax deductions with a Traditional IRA or want tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Choose a diversified asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

4. **Rebalance and Monitor**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Monitor changes in tax laws and contribution limits to adjust your strategy as needed.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial goals and situation.

By taking these steps, you'll be in a better position to manage your retirement savings effectively.
