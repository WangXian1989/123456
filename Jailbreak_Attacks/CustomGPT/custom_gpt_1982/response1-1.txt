Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors like your goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, ensure you’re contributing enough to get the full match first.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Roth IRA contributions are after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRA contributions may provide immediate tax benefits but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   
3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses saved in a liquid account to cover emergencies.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments that may generate capital gains or income.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more towards growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may favor stability.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and generate returns, ensure your allocation stays aligned with your goals.
