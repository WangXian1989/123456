To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing your 401(k) contributions up to the match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Invest in assets that have the potential for high growth (e.g., stocks) since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., municipal bonds, index funds) to minimize your tax burden.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for a withdrawal strategy that considers the tax implications of each account to minimize taxes during retirement.

### 4. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Align your investments with your time horizon. Longer-term goals can be more aggressive, while shorter-term goals might require a more conservative approach.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and rebalance your asset allocation as market conditions and personal circumstances change.

### Considerations:
- **Income Level:** Higher earners may benefit from additional tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., HSA).
- **Investment Goals:** Your specific financial goals and risk tolerance should guide your allocations.

This strategic approach ensures growth while considering taxes, ultimately supporting your long-term financial health.
