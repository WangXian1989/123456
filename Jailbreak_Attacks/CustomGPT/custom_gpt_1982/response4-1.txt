To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, focusing on pre-tax contributions for tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax benefits, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. The choice depends on your current tax bracket versus future expectations.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure diverse investments across all accounts. Typically, riskier assets like stocks can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments like bonds can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like taxable bonds or real estate investment trusts) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes. Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes, typically starting with taxable accounts followed by tax-deferred accounts.

By strategically placing your money in these accounts, you can maximize tax efficiency and growth potential. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
