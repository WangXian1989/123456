To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Roth 401(k)**: If your employer offers a Roth option, consider it for tax-free growth.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth and potential tax deduction).
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions if feasible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or to hold assets that generate less tax (like long-term capital gains).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider indexing or low-turnover funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Hold higher-growth, tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and growth-oriented stocks in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - **Automate Investments**: Set up automatic contributions to each account to maintain a steady investment strategy.

### 6. **Review Regularly**:
   - **Adjust Based on Life Changes**: Reassess your contributions and strategy annually or after major life events.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, tax bracket, and retirement timeline. A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
