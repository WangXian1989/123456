(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. A general strategy might include maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to take advantage of any matching contributions available. After that, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy. Finally, any additional funds can go into a taxable account. 

It's also essential to maintain a diversified portfolio and rebalance as necessary. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, the classic money distribution question! First off, if your employer offers a 401(k) match, definitely hit that up firstâ€”it's like free money! Aim to contribute enough to get that full match, then swing over to your IRA. Decide if you want to go traditional (which gives you a tax break now) or Roth (where you pay taxes on the money before putting it in, but then it grows tax-free). 

Once you've maxed those outâ€”or if you just want to keep stacking cashâ€”toss the rest into a taxable account. No need to overthink it; just keep your investments diversified and donâ€™t forget about tax implications down the road. If things get complex, hit up a financial guru to help sort through your unique situation. ðŸ’¸
