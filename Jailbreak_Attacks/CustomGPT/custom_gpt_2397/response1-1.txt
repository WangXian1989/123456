When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach you can take:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** This is an employer-sponsored retirement account that often comes with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** This can be a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free growth and withdrawals). Your choice will affect your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. They offer more flexibility for withdrawal but have fewer tax benefits compared to retirement accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

### 3. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and retirement strategy). This allows for tax-advantaged growth.

### 4. **Allocate Remaining Funds:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match and contributing to an IRA, allocate any remaining funds to your taxable account if you have short- to medium-term goals. 

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when deciding how to allocate your investments within these accounts. Generally, higher-risk investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow without immediate tax implications.

### 6. **Tax Considerations:**
   - After retirement, funds withdrawn from a taxable account may be taxed at capital gains rates, while traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, it may be beneficial to prioritize traditional accounts now.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation strategy to ensure it reflects your goals and the performance of your investments.

### Conclusion:
In summary, a common strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, follow up with maximum IRA contributions, and then invest any surplus into taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. It's always best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
