When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy will depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), start by contributing enough to take full advantage of this match. This is essentially "free money" and a great first step in your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. However, you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you have a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA, contributions are made using after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**: 
   - If you’re younger and have a longer time until retirement, you might want to prioritize a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth potential. 
   - If you’re closer to retirement, focusing on tax-deferred accounts might be more beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**: Consider the types of investments you hold in each account. For example, it might make sense to hold higher-growth investments (which might generate more taxable income) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), while IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Adjust your contributions accordingly to maximize your savings.

6. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for accessing funds (without penalties) compared to retirement accounts. Consider keeping some funds in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds.

7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Your financial situation and goals will change over time, so it’s important to regularly review and adjust your allocation. Meeting with a financial advisor can also be a wise choice to tailor a strategy that’s right for you.

By following these guidelines and adapting based on your specific situation, you can create a balanced strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
