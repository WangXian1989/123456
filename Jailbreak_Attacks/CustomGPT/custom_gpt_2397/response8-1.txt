When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your current financial situation, your retirement goals, tax implications, and your investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to help guide your decisions:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**

- **401(k):**
  - Offers tax-deferred growth.
  - Many employers match contributions.
  - Contribution limits may be higher compared to IRAs.

- **IRA (Individual Retirement Accounts):**
  - Traditional IRA: Tax-deductible contributions. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
  - Roth IRA: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains.
  - Offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
- **Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After receiving the match, consider maxing out your IRA—especially if you are eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
- **Growth Needs:** If you're looking for growth, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA for higher growth potential through equity investments.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize tax liability. Use your tax-advantaged accounts for less tax-efficient investments.

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Timeline:**
- If you’re far from retirement, lean towards stocks in tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
- As you near retirement, begin shifting towards more stable investments or bonds, keeping tax implications in mind.

### 5. **Tax Implications:**
- Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, so consider when and how much you may need in retirement.
- With a Roth IRA, qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 6. **Maintain Flexibility:**
- Ensure that you maintain a balance between your accounts to have access to funds where needed, especially in emergencies.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
- Re-evaluate your financial situation and goals regularly, adjusting your distributions as needed.

### Conclusion:
A common strategy might be to contribute enough to your 401(k) for the employer match, then max out your IRA, and finally contribute any remaining funds to your taxable accounts. However, your specific situation may require adjustments based on income levels, tax situations, and investment goals.

### FAQs:
1. **What happens if I exceed contribution limits?**
   - Excess contributions can result in penalties, so it’s important to stay within the limits.

2. **Can I withdraw from my IRA before retirement?**
   - Withdrawals before age 59½ may incur a penalty, but there are exceptions.

3. **What are the tax implications of selling investments in a taxable account?**
   - You pay capital gains tax on profits made from selling assets.

4. **Is it better to roll over a 401(k) to an IRA?**
   - It depends on your investment goals and options in your 401(k); consult a financial advisor.

5. **How often should I rebalance my investments?**
   - Generally, it’s a good practice to review and rebalance your portfolio at least once a year or when significant market changes occur.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.
