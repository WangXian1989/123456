While I cannot provide personalized financial advice, I can suggest a general strategy to consider when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. 

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: First, if your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). If you qualify, a Roth IRA may be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Depending on your financial situation, aim to max out contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA for the tax advantages they offer. This includes understanding the limits set by the IRS for contributions annually.

4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts to the fullest, allocate excess funds to taxable accounts. This gives you more liquidity and flexibility, though you'll face taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified and regularly rebalance them to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Donâ€™t forget about having a liquid emergency fund separate from these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

For tailored advice, itâ€™s best to consult with a financial advisor who can consider your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
