Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, your investment goals, and your financial situation. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductibility depending on your income.

### 2. **Optimal Contribution Strategy**
   - **Max Out Contribution Limits**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts for Additional Growth**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account for additional investment flexibility.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust your portfolio according to your age, risk tolerance, and time until retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts. Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - **Annual Review**: Reassess your contributions and asset allocations annually based on changes in income, expenses, or life circumstances.

Following this structured approach will optimize your investment growth while considering the tax implications associated with each account type.
