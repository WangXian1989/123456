To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts but consider the tax implications:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-free.
   - Consider placing income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to use lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you'll need in the near term or for investments that are best held there (like tax-efficient index funds). This gives you flexibility without penalty.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on your goals, market conditions, and changing financial situations.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
