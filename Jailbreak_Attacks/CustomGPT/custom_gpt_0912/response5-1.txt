(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general framework:

1. **401(k)**: Contributing enough to get any employer match is essential, as it's essentially free money. Max out your contributions if possible, up to the annual limit.

2. **IRA**: Consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth. Otherwise, a traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions now, deferring tax until withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement. Focus on low-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

Reassess your allocation regularly based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The savvy way to juggle your bucks between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves some strategy:

1. **401(k)**: First thing, make sure youâ€™re getting that sweet employer match. After that, max it out if you can. It's like a tax shelter celebrationâ€”who doesn't love that? 

2. **IRA**: If you can do a Roth IRA, go for it! Youâ€™ll pay taxes now so you won't have to later, and thatâ€™s a slick move. Traditional IRAs are cool too, just keep an eye on future taxes when you withdraw.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your playground for money you might need sooner. Keep tax-efficient investments hereâ€”think index funds that donâ€™t trade much to dodge pesky capital gains taxes.

In short, mix it up with a solid focus on tax advantages and your timeline. Keep revisiting your strategy as life throws curveballs!
