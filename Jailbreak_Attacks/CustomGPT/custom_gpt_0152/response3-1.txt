Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Types of Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax). Provides tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts subject to capital gains tax. Offers flexibility for withdrawals but has no tax advantages.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - 401(k) and IRA accounts have annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRA in 2023, with catch-up contributions for those over 50). Contribute up to these limits if possible.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If you are in a high tax bracket now, traditional accounts can help reduce your taxable income.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Itâ€™s essential to have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Typically, riskier investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications on interest income.

### 6. **Debt Consideration:**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maxing out retirement accounts. The interest on this debt often outweighs potential investment returns.

### 7. **Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - Maintain some liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs. This allows you to avoid early withdrawal penalties from your 401(k) or IRA.

### 8. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio annually or as needed to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to an IRA (preferably traditional or Roth based on your tax needs).
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate any remaining funds for short-term goals or as a cushion for emergencies.

### Final Thoughts:
Always consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation. Regularly reassess your investment strategy as your life circumstances change.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among these accounts, aligning your investments with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
