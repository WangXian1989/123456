Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing your investment goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here's a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**

- **401(k):** 
  - Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions.
  - Contributions are pre-tax or after-tax (Roth options) depending on your plan.
  - Taxes are deferred until withdrawal in retirement.

- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
  - Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
  - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Invested money isn't tax-advantaged.
  - Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
- Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxable income.
- If your employer offers a match in the 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
- For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), especially if you are years away from retirement.
- For shorter-term goals, consider utilizing taxable accounts for liquidity, keeping in mind the tax implications of selling investments.

### 4. **Diversification:**
- Allocate investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
- Ensure that your overall asset allocation is aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
- Periodically review and adjust your allocation to ensure it remains in line with your investment strategy and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
- A professional can personalize your strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and market condition.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **Aggressive Growth:** 60% 401(k), 20% IRA, 20% Taxable
- **Moderate Growth:** 40% 401(k), 30% IRA, 30% Taxable
- **Conservative:** 30% 401(k), 30% IRA, 40% Taxable

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your unique circumstances and objectives. ðŸŽ¯
