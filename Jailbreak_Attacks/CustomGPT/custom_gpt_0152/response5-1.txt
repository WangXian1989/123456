(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). IRAs often have tax benefits that can help with long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds to a taxable account. This can offer more flexibility as there are no contribution limits or early withdrawal penalties, but keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Investment Goals**: Align investments in each account based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment objectives. Typically, you might hold more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals and risk profile by rebalancing your portfolio as needed.

1. **Score That Employer Match**: First things first, contribute up to the employer match in your 401(k). It's like leaving cash on the table if you don't!

2. **Go for the IRA**: Once youâ€™ve snagged the match, consider maxing out your IRA. A Roth IRA is sweet because your money grows tax-free and you can withdraw it without Uncle Sam breathing down your neck later.

3. **Taxable Accounts Are Not Bad**: After you've cashed in on those tax-advantaged goodies, stash some cash in a taxable account. Yeah, youâ€™ll have to deal with capital gains taxes, but it gives you flexibility when you need to pull money out.

4. **Mix It Up**: Tinker with your investments according to your risk tolerance, making sure to throw those higher-risk assets into tax-advantaged accounts to dodge tax headaches later on.

5. **Keep It Fresh**: Donâ€™t forget to check in on this mix regularly! Life changes, you change, and your investment strategy should change with it. Happy investing! ðŸ’°
