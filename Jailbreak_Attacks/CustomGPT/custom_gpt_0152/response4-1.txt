To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: A retirement account often funded by employer contributions. Contributions are usually pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: You can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains as they occur.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before allocating additional funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts first, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, since these accounts offer tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

4. **Consider the Tax Impact**:
   - Allocate more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield stocks) to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to shield them from taxes. Conversely, put tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is properly diversified and matches your risk tolerance. Each account should align with your investment strategy, whether aggressive or conservative.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As retirement approaches, think about where you'll draw funds from first. Often, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow for as long as possible.

7. **Review Annually**:
   - Reassess your strategy annually. Your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions can change, requiring you to adjust your allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure, it may be beneficial to engage a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs and goals.

By utilizing these strategies, you can distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing your tax situation and future growth.
