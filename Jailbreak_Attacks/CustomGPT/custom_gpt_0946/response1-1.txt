When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to think about:

1. **Employer Match First**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're not maxing out your contributions, consider putting in more to take advantage of tax deferral. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The 2023 contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional savings. These are more flexible in terms of withdrawals and investment options but don’t offer the same tax benefits.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Your allocation between these accounts can depend on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Usually, it’s advisable to hold more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Roth Conversions**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider strategies like a Roth conversion to take advantage of lower tax years.

6. **Keep an Eye on Taxes**: Monitor your tax situation regularly to determine if changes in contributions might be beneficial depending on your income or expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since everyone's financial situation is unique, it may be prudent to speak with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy that fits your individual needs.
