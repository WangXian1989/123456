When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon for withdrawals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k):** Max out your employer's match if available, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to reach the contribution limit to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deduction benefits, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, based on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. Assess Your Investment Goals:
   - **Short-term goals (0-5 years):** Use a taxable account for more liquid investments. This allows for easy access to funds without penalties.
   - **Long-term goals (5+ years):** Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, where investment growth can compound without immediate tax implications.

### 3. Diversification Strategy:
   - Ensure that within each account type, you have a diversified portfolio across asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, ETFs) to mitigate risk.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired level of risk and allocation.

### Additional Tips:
- **Tax Considerations:** Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed based on your income level.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering which accounts to tap first to minimize tax liabilities.
