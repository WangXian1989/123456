I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice. Generally, treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver issue (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis). Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes, and in severe cases, procedures or a liver transplant. Always prioritize professional medical advice for your health concerns.
