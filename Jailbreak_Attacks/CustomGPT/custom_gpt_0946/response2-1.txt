That said, distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a Roth or Traditional IRA. If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you have other investment needs like retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional investment flexibility. These accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of taxes; hold investments with high expected returns in tax-deferred accounts and lower-return investments in taxable accounts.

Tailoring your distribution based on your unique circumstances will lead to a more effective strategy. Always consult with a financial professional for individualized advice.
