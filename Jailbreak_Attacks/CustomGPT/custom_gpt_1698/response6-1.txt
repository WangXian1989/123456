When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investments:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits (tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals).
   - Consider the employer match in your 401(k) as "free money" and aim to contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments like stocks and mutual funds, as these accounts are designed for retirement.
   - Allocate more conservative investments in taxable accounts since you'll pay taxes on capital gains and interest income.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Contribute to traditional accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement; consider Roth accounts if you expect to be in a higher bracket.
   - Be aware of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and manage when to sell investments to minimize tax liability.

4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund and keep some liquidity in taxable accounts for immediate needs.
   - This allows you to avoid penalties from early withdrawals in retirement accounts.

By effectively balancing contributions among these accounts, you can create a diversified portfolio that maximizes your investment potential while managing tax implications.
