The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your personal financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have maxed out the employer match, consider contributing further based on your current tax bracket. Traditional 401(k)s lower your taxable income now, while Roth 401(k)s allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA if you need the tax deduction now. The contribution limit for IRAs is typically lower than 401(k)s, so contribute up to the maximum allowed.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts can offer more liquidity and flexibility, but they come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: When distributing your investments across these accounts, maintain a balanced asset allocation that reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals. 
   - **Tax-efficient investing**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your targeted asset allocation strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual financial situations, it’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

By following these guidelines and adjusting based on your specific circumstances, you can create a well-diversified strategy for your retirement savings across different account types.
