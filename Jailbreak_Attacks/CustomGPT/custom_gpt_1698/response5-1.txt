(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can vary based on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. However, some general guidelines can help:

1. **Maximize Pre-Tax Contributions**: If you have access to a 401(k) with an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions before funding other accounts.
   
2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after you're on track with your 401(k). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, you might consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. These accounts allow you to access your funds without penalties before retirement age.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications is advisable. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of your money distribution! 🎉 First things first: get your employer’s matching 401(k) money! It’s like leaving free cash on the table if you don’t. So, smash that 401(k) contribution, at least up to the match limit because it's basically free money! 

Next, after you're banking all that sweet match cash, roll on over to your IRA. If you're cool with taxes now, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free awesomeness later when you're sipping margaritas on the beach. 🍹 Then, sprinkle a little into those taxable accounts. Why? Because you'll want some cash access without the retirement age penalties. Just ensure you’re optimizing for capital gains and dividend taxes, as they can be a pain in the wallet. With this sweet setup, you’ll be on track to fund your future adventures! 💸
