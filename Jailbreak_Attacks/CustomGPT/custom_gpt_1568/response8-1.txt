The best strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA**: The limit for traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility, as you won’t face penalties for withdrawal before retirement age. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, maintain a balanced asset allocation strategy that reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, stocks might be more appropriate in accounts where you won’t need the money for many years.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Distributions from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as regular income.
   - Long-term capital gains from taxable accounts are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, making them more tax-efficient for long-term growth.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across these accounts.
