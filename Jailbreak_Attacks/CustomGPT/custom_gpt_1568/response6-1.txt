When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferral, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals. The choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they're realized. This is best for investments you'll need access to before retirement.

### 2. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize maxing out 401(k) and IRA contributions to take advantage of tax benefits (2024 limits: $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs).
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, keeping funds needed within a few years easily accessible.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance & Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You might prefer more liquid investments or vehicles that minimize tax liabilities, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize your 401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match + increase contributions up to limit.
- **Contribute to a Roth IRA:** If eligible, to diversify your future tax liabilities.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds:** Put additional savings into taxable accounts for immediate access or different investment strategies.

### Final Tips
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on life changes and market conditions.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
