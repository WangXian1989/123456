It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems, but some common treatment options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Following a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol, high-fat foods, and added sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed. Antiviral medications are common for viral hepatitis.

3. **Supplements**: Some people may benefit from specific vitamins or supplements, but it's crucial to discuss this with a doctor first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and any progression of the disease.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications and chemicals.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options might be considered.

Itâ€™s essential to get a thorough diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific needs from a healthcare professional.
