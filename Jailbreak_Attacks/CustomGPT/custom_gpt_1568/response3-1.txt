Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. Ideal for long-term savings, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k), with potential tax deductions depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility without contribution limits but are less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in cash or a liquid account before heavily investing.

4. **Diversification**: Balance high-growth investments in your taxable account with bond or income-generating investments in tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and IRAs to minimize tax impact.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term goals (retirement) and taxable accounts for short-term goals (buying a house, travel).

6. **Reassessment**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changing financial situations, market conditions, and approaching retirement.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
