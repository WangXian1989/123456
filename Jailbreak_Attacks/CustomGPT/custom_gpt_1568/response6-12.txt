I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are commonly recommended for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some potential options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Modifications:** Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Reduce saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence:** Avoid alcohol completely, as it can exacerbate liver issues.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Liver Protectants:** Supplements like milk thistle may provide some liver protection, but consult a doctor before starting any supplements.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Routine Check-Ups:** Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and overall health.

4. **Specialist Care:**
   - **Hepatologist Consultation:** A liver specialist can provide tailored treatment plans and advanced therapies if necessary.

Make sure to discuss these options with your healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment for your situation.
