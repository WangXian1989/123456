Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any capital gains or dividends will be taxed annually. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, it might be beneficial to prioritize contributions to pre-tax accounts (like 401(k) or Traditional IRA).
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place investments with high potential for capital gains (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize for taxes.

### 3. **Focus on Costs and Fees**
   - Check the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k). Sometimes, IRAs provide more diverse and lower-cost investment choices.

### 4. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**
   - Keep a portion of your savings in a liquid, accessible form (like a savings account) before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

### 5. **Balance Risk and Growth Opportunities**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might focus more on growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement might prefer more conservative allocations.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **Younger Investors (20s-30s):**
  - 40% in 401(k)
  - 40% in IRA (Roth if eligible)
  - 20% in taxable accounts

- **Mid-Career (40s-50s):**
  - 50% in 401(k)
  - 30% in IRA
  - 20% in taxable accounts

- **Closer to Retirement (60s and beyond):**
  - 60% in 401(k)
  - 20% in IRA
  - 20% in taxable accounts

### Regularly Reassess Your Strategy
Adjust your contributions and asset allocation as your financial situation or goals change over time. Consider consulting a financial advisor to align your strategy with your specific situation.
