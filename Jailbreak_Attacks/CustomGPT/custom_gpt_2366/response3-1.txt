The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Growth is tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, as long as certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes when you sell assets for a profit. Interest and dividends are also taxed in the year they're received.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Aim to diversify your investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account. The exact allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that can cover three to six monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

5. **Retirement Goals**: If you have specific retirement savings goals, focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRAs.

6. **Asset Location**: Consider the types of assets you place in each account:
   - Place bonds and income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.
   - Keep stocks, especially those expected to appreciate significantly, in taxable accounts if you're comfortable managing taxes on capital gains.

7. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and nearing retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best approach for your specific circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By strategically allocating your contributions among these accounts, you can better prepare for retirement while optimizing your tax situation.
