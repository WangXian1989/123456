I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver issues. It's really important to consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Common treatment options for liver problems often focus on the underlying cause and may include lifestyle changes, medications, or other interventions. Here are some general options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Many liver problems can improve with lifestyle modifications. This includes maintaining a healthy diet, losing weight if overweight, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), your doctor may prescribe medications to help manage the conditions.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: For chronic liver conditions, regular monitoring through blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to assess liver function and manage the condition effectively.

4. **Procedures**: In some cases, medical procedures (such as endoscopy for varices or surgery for tumors) may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a transplant may be considered if the liver is too damaged to function properly.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
