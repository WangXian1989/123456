Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older). Consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diversified mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA can be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Diversification**: Like a 401(k), focus on a diversified investment portfolio. A Roth IRA may be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: These accounts provide easier access to funds without penalties, which is advantageous if you have short-term financial goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **High Growth Potential**: You can invest aggressively since there are no contribution limits, but ensure you're considering your overall tax liabilities.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Make sure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Asset Allocation**: Determine an overall asset allocation strategy that spreads your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash).
- **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, it may be beneficial to seek input from a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your personal financial situation, so it's important to evaluate your specific goals, risk tolerance, and timeline when making these decisions.
