Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA, either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and eligibility. This can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Withdrawals Impact:** Keep in mind that distributions from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, whereas capital gains (from taxable accounts) can be taxed at a lower rate if held long enough (over one year).
   - **Roth Option:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA could be beneficial as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Accessibility:**
   - **Long-Term Growth in Retirement Accounts:** Focus more aggressive growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA since they are for retirement and will have more time to recover from market fluctuations.
   - **Stable Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Utilize your taxable accounts for investments you may need to access earlier or for more conservative holdings to manage risk.

### 4. **Diversification and Rebalancing:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account type.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Considering your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon can help you make a more tailored decision. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation is also advisable.
