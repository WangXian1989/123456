Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation:
   - **Traditional IRA:** Great if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later or want tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Retirement Goals:** If you have significant retirement savings already, consider using a taxable account for short- to medium-term goals, as it offers more flexibility.

4. **Tax Considerations:** 
   - Interest, dividends, and short-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at ordinary rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-yield investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
