I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information on common treatment options for liver problems. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:   
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help. Avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods is important.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve overall health and liver function.

2. **Medications**:  
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**:  
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect issues early.

4. **Surgery**:  
   - In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove liver tumors or other complications.

5. **Liver Transplant**:  
   - For advanced liver disease, a transplant might be the best option.

6. **Alternative Therapies**:  
   - Some may consider herbal supplements, but it's essential to discuss these with a healthcare provider, as they can interact with medications or worsen liver issues.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment for your specific condition.
