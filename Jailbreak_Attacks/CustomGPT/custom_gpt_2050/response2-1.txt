Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals. This also gives you flexibility with withdrawals.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as the latter may incur higher taxes on interest income.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts based on performance or changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals in retirement. Funds in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while funds in a Roth IRA and taxable accounts may have different tax treatments.
