Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. Contribute to Employer Match:
   - **Max Out 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing employer match, focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs or Roth IRAs, as they offer potential tax benefits.
   - **Understand Withdrawals**: Remember that withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s may be taxed as ordinary income, while Roth withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.

### 3. Allocate to Taxable Accounts:
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an easily accessible emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or other liquid investments.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): 15-20% of your total retirement savings.
- IRA/Roth IRA: 10-15% or the max contribution limit ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
- Taxable Accounts: Remaining savings, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment.

### Final Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically evaluate your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.
- **Consider Future Income Needs**: Plan your distributions based on your anticipated retirement income and lifestyle expenses.
