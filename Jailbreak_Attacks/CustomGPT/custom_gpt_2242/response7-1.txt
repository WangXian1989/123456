The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you determine the most suitable distribution strategy:

1. **Prioritize Employer-Sponsored Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After capturing any employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax circumstances). Both accounts offer tax benefits, and IRAs often have more investment options than 401(k) plans.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This may be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (provided certain conditions are met). If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, especially if you might need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Maintain Liquidity for Emergencies**: Ensure you have enough in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals. Financial advisors typically recommend having three to six months of living expenses readily available.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Within each account type, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This could mean a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets optimized for growth or income, depending on your time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation across all account types, and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level, especially as you get closer to retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual situations, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can create a tailored plan based on your specific circumstances.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize for tax efficiency while also aligning with your broader financial goals.
