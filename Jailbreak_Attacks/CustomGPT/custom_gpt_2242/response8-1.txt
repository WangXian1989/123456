Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money and can provide a solid foundation for your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA/ROTH IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between the two often depends on your current versus expected future tax rates.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional savings. These are beneficial for liquidity and flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties, though you need to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, aim for a diversified investment strategy (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, the value and performance of your investments can shift your original asset allocation. Rebalance your portfolio at least annually to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific financial situation.

Always tailor your approach to align with your unique circumstances, and remember to review your strategy periodically as your financial situation and goals evolve.
