Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some tips on how to approach this distribution:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you're receiving a match. This account is often tax-advantaged, delaying taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: If you can afford it, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider funding these accounts after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for savings that you may need access to before retirement age.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income in the year made but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains tax on dividends and realized gains, so consider this in your investment choices (e.g., tax-efficient funds).

### 3. Align Investments with Goals:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments, such as stocks, while keeping more conservative investments in taxable accounts if you might need quick access to the funds.
   - Consider using index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts as they tend to have lower turnover and fewer tax implications.

### 4. Regular Reviews and Adjustments:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on market performance and your changing financial situation or retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your gross salary (up to match limit)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions after 401(k) match
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after leveraging tax-deferred options

### Conclusion:
The balance in these accounts varies based on individual circumstances. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your needs while considering tax implications and future goals.
