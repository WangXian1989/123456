To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching contributions. Focus on maximizing this benefit first.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-advantaged (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These have no tax advantages, but gains are taxed at capital gains rates. Use these for short-term goals or liquidity needs.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to IRA**: Next, fund your IRA up to the maximum allowable contribution. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, depending on your income level.

3. **Allocate by Investment Goal and Timeline**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on stocks or stock funds in 401(k) and IRA accounts.
   - **Income Needs**: Bonds can be better placed in taxable accounts where interest income is taxed at your ordinary rate.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Invest more tax-efficient assets (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Adjust with Life Changes**:
   - Regularly review your allocations as you approach retirement or experience significant life events (job changes, marriage, etc.).

6. **Seek Professional Guidance**:
   - Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your specific goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers tax efficiency, investment goals, and your financial situation will be the best way to distribute your money.
