To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. This will influence which accounts you prioritize for funding.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match initially—it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible (the limit for 2024 is $23,000).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer a traditional IRA, you get a tax deduction occasionally, depending on income limits.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) in all accounts for balanced risk. Each account can have a different focus based on tax implications and when you plan to access the funds.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may be taxed at a lower rate, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. This account can also provide liquidity for short-term needs without penalties.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Monitor your overall portfolio. Adjust the allocations periodically based on performance and changes in financial goals or market conditions.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have adequate savings for emergencies (3-6 months of living expenses).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized approach based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and tax considerations can provide tailored strategies.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment distribution across these accounts, enhancing your financial growth while managing risks and tax liabilities.
