When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to focus on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some tips for effective allocation:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but earnings are subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts allow for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth Options**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that benefit.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize accounts with tax advantages.
   - For medium-term goals (home purchase, education), consider taxable accounts where you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Adjust your asset allocation as you approach retirement to reduce risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset distribution and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing tax efficiency.
