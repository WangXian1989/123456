To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Timeline**: How far are you from retirement?
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Are you comfortable with market fluctuations?

### 2. **Utilize Tax Advantages**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your IRA and 401(k) before considering taxable accounts. 

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on diversified funds or target-date funds tailored to your retirement date.
   - **IRA**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments to balance risk, with a tilt based on your age and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains tax, and consider holding assets longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Contribution Limits & Penalties**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each type of account (e.g., 401(k) and IRA) and potential penalties for early withdrawals.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to adhere to your asset allocation strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If in doubt, consult a financial planner to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and efficient approach to distributing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
