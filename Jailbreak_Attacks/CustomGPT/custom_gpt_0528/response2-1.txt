Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here's a general strategy you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify based on income limits. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial for tax deferral.

### 3. **Continue Funding 401(k)**
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k). The 2024 limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds beyond your tax-advantaged retirement accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be useful for shorter-term savings or goals.

### 5. **Consider Asset Location**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize tax impact.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Regularly Rebalance Your Portfolio**
   - Monitor and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 7. **Review Your Tax Situation Annually**
   - Adjust your contributions based on any changes in tax legislation or your personal tax situation to optimize your overall tax efficiency.

### Conclusion
Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation and to ensure you’re making the most tax-efficient decisions regarding your investments.
