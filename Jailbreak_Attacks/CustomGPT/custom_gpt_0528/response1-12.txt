For liver problems, treatment options depend on the specific condition diagnosed (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis). Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt is recommended. Foods rich in fiber, fruits, and vegetables are beneficial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and improves liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferon and direct-acting antivirals may be prescribed.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.
   - **Insulin Sensitizers**: For non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any progression.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**:
   - Complete abstinence from alcohol is crucial for liver health.

5. **Weight Loss**:
   - If overweight, losing weight can significantly improve liver health.

6. **Surgery/Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.
