I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet (low in fat and sugar), regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying causes (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Weight Management**: Losing weight can improve liver function, especially in conditions like fatty liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track your liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
