To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes until withdrawal, usually during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), but offers more investment flexibility. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. This account is more flexible but can incur higher taxes.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first.
   - Contribute the maximum allowable to your IRA (traditional or Roth).

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider placing higher-growth, riskier assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to avoid annual taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments, like bonds, which may have lower capital gains implications.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals:**
   - Short-term needs may require more liquidity, suggesting a higher allocation in taxable accounts.
   - Long-term growth might lead you to heavily invest in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

By balancing between tax advantages and your financial goals, you can create an optimal distribution strategy.
