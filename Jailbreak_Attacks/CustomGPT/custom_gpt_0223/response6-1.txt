To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Max out tax-advantaged accounts** first (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Place investments with high expected returns or frequent trading (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
  
2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible form before allocating large amounts to retirement accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account to optimize your savings strategy.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across different asset classes in each account to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
