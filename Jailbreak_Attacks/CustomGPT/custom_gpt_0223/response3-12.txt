It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver issues. However, common treatment options may include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may help manage symptoms and improve liver function.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt can be beneficial. Foods rich in antioxidants and fiber are often recommended.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoid or limit alcohol consumption, as it can exacerbate liver problems.

3. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure should be managed effectively.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider for liver function tests and imaging studies to monitor liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as for liver tumors or cirrhosis, surgical options may be considered.

Always discuss with your doctor to develop a treatment plan suited to your specific condition.
