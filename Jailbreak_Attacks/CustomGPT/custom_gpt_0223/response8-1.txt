Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions available for those 50 and older).

4. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment choices in your 401(k); if they are limited or have high fees, additional contributions to an IRA or taxable account may be preferable.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement age. They can offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

6. **Diversify Asset Locations**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and more tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

7. **Reevaluate Annually**:
   - Review your portfolio regularly and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
