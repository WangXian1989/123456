Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens (e.g., long-term capital gains and qualified dividends).
   - Keep high-growth investments (which may generate high short-term capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. Maxing these out can significantly boost your retirement savings.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Ensure you’re not over-concentrated in one asset class.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Rebalance as necessary.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re young, focus more on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts. As you near retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments.

7. **Work with a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve!
