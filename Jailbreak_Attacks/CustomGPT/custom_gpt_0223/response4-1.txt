Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth or more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate dividends or interest, since you may want to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan your distributions early in retirement to minimize tax impacts, keeping in mind required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 401(k) and Traditional IRA accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help align your strategy with your specific financial situation and goals.

For a detailed plan, consider your current situation and future needs.
