Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**:
     - Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
     - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions if possible (as of 2023, $6,500 per year, $7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties, making them useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize contributions to accounts with the best tax advantages first** (401(k) match, IRA).
- **Diversify investments** across all accounts to balance risk.
- **Reassess regularly** to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your changing goals and market conditions.

### Resources:
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
- Tools like investment calculators can help project future growth based on different allocation strategies.

This approach enables you to leverage tax benefits while preparing for both short- and long-term financial needs.
