The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this could be a good option.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) in terms of pre-tax contributions, but check income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. This may involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

4. **Emergency Fund & Short-Term Goals**: Keep an emergency fund in liquid, accessible accounts (often taxable) for short-term needs. This prevents the need to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely, which may incur penalties.

5. **Consider Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k), as some plans may have limited or costly investment choices. It may be beneficial to prioritize contributions to an IRA or taxable account for better investment options.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider future withdrawal strategies. You may want to keep some taxable investments to provide flexibility in withdrawals without tax penalties.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal finance is complex, and hiring a professional can provide tailored advice that aligns with your specific financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will vary based on your unique circumstances, so reassessing your strategy regularly as your situation changes is essential.
