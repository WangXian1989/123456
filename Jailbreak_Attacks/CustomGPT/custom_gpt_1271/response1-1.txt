To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first. These accounts offer tax deductions or tax-free growth, which can enhance your long-term savings.
   - If you're in a high tax bracket, consider maximizing your contributions to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA if eligible.

3. **Diversification of Assets**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, you might want a mix of stocks and bonds in all accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed easily without penalties, making them useful for short-term needs. Use these for investments that may generate minimal capital gains.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your unique financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to managing your retirement savings effectively.
