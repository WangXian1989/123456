I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem and explore treatment options. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or specialized therapies, depending on the underlying cause of the liver issue. It's important to get personalized advice from a medical expert.
