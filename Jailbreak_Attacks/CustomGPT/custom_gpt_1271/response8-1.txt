When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies aimed at balancing tax efficiency, growth potential, and access to funds:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your **401(k)**, especially if your employer offers a match. Contributing enough to receive the full match is essentially free money.
   - After optimizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a **Traditional IRA** or a **Roth IRA** depending on your eligibility. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts** (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) allow for tax-free growth, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable accounts** do not have the same tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age, and you only pay capital gains taxes on realized gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth assets (stocks) that would benefit the most from tax deferral.
   - Consider holding more stable investments (like bonds) in your taxable accounts because they typically yield taxable interest income.

4. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies, as withdrawing from retirement accounts can incur penalties and taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider a strategy that balances withdrawals between these accounts to optimize taxes, potentially withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts last.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
