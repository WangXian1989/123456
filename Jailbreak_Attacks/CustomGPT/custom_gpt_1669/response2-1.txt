The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Tax-Advantaged Account**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA if you qualify. These accounts offer tax advantages that can help your investments grow more efficiently over time.
   - If you're eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for its tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**: Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs each year. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, start investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: If you have a longer time until retirement, you might allocate a higher percentage to stocks in your 401(k) and IRAs. For taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of where you hold certain assets. For example, keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize your tax burden.

7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals may change over time, so periodically reassess your contributions and allocations.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your specific situation, ensuring it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
