Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Max out any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Focus on high-growth investments, as your contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Contribute to an IRA, especially if you qualify for tax deductions (Traditional) or if you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
   - Consider your tax situation when choosing between Traditional and Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for money you might need in the short to medium term.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to accounts with the best tax advantages (e.g., 401(k) and IRA).
- Balance your risk across accounts based on your timeline for needing the funds.
- Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor is often beneficial for a personalized strategy.
