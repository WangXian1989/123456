I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on treatment options for liver problems. Treatment often depends on the specific liver condition you have, but here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet Modification**: Adopt a balanced, low-fat diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables. Avoid alcohol and reduce salt intake.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight can help reduce liver fat and inflammation.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the type of liver disease (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms and slow disease progression.
   - In the case of autoimmune liver diseases, immunosuppressants may be used.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - If the liver disease has progressed, procedures like liver biopsy or imaging tests may be necessary to assess damage and treatment effectiveness.
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. It's important to address liver problems promptly to prevent complications.
