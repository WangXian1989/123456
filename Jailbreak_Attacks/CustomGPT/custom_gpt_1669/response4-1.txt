Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing any 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income levels and tax preferences. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

5. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. For example, income from a 401(k) and traditional IRA is taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, while long-term capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates.

6. **Financial Goals**: Align your allocation with your personal financial goals, whether itâ€™s saving for a home, funding education, or retirement.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to create a distribution plan tailored to your specific situation.
