I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information regarding liver problems and treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. 

Treatment options depend on the specific liver condition, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some common treatment approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Modifying your diet to include healthy foods, losing weight, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat specific diseases (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Ongoing assessments through blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as with liver tumors or cysts, surgical options may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For irreparable liver damage, a transplant may be considered.

Make sure to follow up with your healthcare provider for guidance tailored to your specific situation.
