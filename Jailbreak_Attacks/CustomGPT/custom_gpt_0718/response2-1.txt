To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following aspects:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow for pre-tax contributions, but Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have the tax advantages of retirement accounts, but they provide more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure that you're aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. Max out employer matching contributions in your 401(k) if available.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you need access to funds in the near term, keep more in taxable accounts since you can access them freely without penalties.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across different types of accounts to manage risk. Use some accounts for more aggressive growth investments and others for stable income.

6. **Age and Timing**:
   - Your age can influence how aggressively you should invest. Younger individuals may lean towards growth in taxable accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on stable investments across accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k)** contributions to take advantage of employer matching, if available.
- Once you reach the employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify; otherwise, continue contributing to a traditional IRA.
- Any additional savings can be allocated to your taxable account for more immediate or flexible investment opportunities.

### Example:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (up to employer match)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Max out contributions based on eligibility (currently $6,500/year or $7,500 if you're 50 or older)
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after maximizing retirement accounts; this could be around 10-20% of your income.
