To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here's a general approach to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great first step.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, it might be wise to pay that down before allocating too much into retirement accounts.

3. **Contribute to Your Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize your employer's match, then consider increasing your contributions based on your budget. Remember that 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you have the ability to save beyond your 401(k), contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA can provide tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but have income limits.
  
4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties before retirement age and can be helpful for your short-term and medium-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts according to your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. Generally, younger investors might allocate more towards higher-risk assets like stocks, while those closer to retirement may want more stable investments.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep in mind that different investments are taxed differently. For example, consider placing bonds and high-dividend stocks in tax-sheltered accounts (like IRAs) while holding more tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your distribution strategy and make adjustments as needed, especially as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your unique circumstances and goals.
