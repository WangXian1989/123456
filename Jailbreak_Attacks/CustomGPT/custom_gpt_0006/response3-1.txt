The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment options available in each account. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

1. **Assess Your Retirement Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement age, lifestyle expectations, and how much money you’ll need during retirement.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s ($20,500 for individuals under 50, $27,000 for those 50 and older for the tax year 2022) and IRAs ($6,000 for individuals under 50, $7,000 for those 50 and older).

3. **Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money and provides a good return on investment.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement, which could be beneficial depending on your tax bracket.
   - Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals and offer more flexibility, but you will pay capital gains taxes on any profits.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk and potential taxes efficiently. For example, place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocations across all three accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Adjust contributions based on performance and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations.

In summary, prioritize employer matches in your 401(k), consider a Roth IRA if it aligns with your tax strategy, and use taxable accounts for additional flexibility. Regularly review and adjust your distribution based on performance and changing financial circumstances.
