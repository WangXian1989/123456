(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment time horizon, and tax situation. Generally, here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term savings.

3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but come with tax implications on gains.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Investing in a mix of tax-deferred (401(k) and IRA) and taxable accounts may help you manage your tax liability better in retirement, as you'll have different types of accounts to pull from.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance. Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

1. **401(k) First**: Smash that 401(k) with contributions up to the employer match! If theyâ€™re tossing in free money for every dollar you saveâ€”hell yes, grab it like it's going out of style! Youâ€™d be a fool not to. 

2. **IRA Time**: Once youâ€™ve snagged that sweet match, dive into your IRA. Whether itâ€™s traditional or Roth, this is where the magic happensâ€”tax breaks galore! Think of it as your tax-advantaged playground. If you're going for Roth, remember that tax-free withdrawals in retirement are the beeâ€™s knees.
