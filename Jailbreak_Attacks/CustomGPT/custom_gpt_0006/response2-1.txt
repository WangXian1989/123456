Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute the maximum amount allowed, especially if you are closer to retirement. The contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The contribution limits for 2023 are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Contributions to a 401(k) or Traditional IRA are made pre-tax, meaning you won't pay taxes on them until withdrawal. This can be beneficial for high-income earners who want to lower their current tax burden.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement, or for investments with favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends).

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressively investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a safe and accessible location.

5. **Investment Timeline**:
   - For long-term investments (like in your 401(k) and IRA), you can afford to take on more risk since you have time to recover from market downturns.
   - For shorter-term needs, prioritize safer, less volatile investments in your taxable account.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio as needed to align with your financial goals and changing market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure of the optimal strategy for your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.

Remember, everyone's situation is unique, so consider your personal financial goals and consult with a professional if necessary.
