Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money. The contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides a tax deduction now.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals and doesn’t have the same restrictions as retirement accounts.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts; consider low-turnover strategies or tax-efficient funds.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term Goals**: For goals within 5 years (like buying a home), consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easy access.
   - **Long-term Goals**: If focused on retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts where your investments can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.
   - **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize tax implications.

### Conclusion
The best strategy is to balance between these accounts based on your individual circumstances. Regularly reassess your distribution as your income, goals, and market conditions change. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
