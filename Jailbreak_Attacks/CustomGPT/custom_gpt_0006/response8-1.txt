Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contribution (up to the annual limit), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial depending on your expected tax situation at retirement.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Make sure you're aware of the contribution limits for each account:
   - For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older.
   - The limit for IRAs is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.
   - Understand the implications of realized gains and losses in taxable accounts and consider using strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors.
   - Depending on your investment horizon, consider a mix of growth and income-generating investments.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio ensures that your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and to navigate any complexities in tax laws.

It's essential to continuously evaluate and adjust your strategy as your life circumstances and financial goals change.
