Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a highly liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Assess Withdrawal Needs**: Plan for how you'll access your funds in retirement. 401(k) and IRAs have specific rules about withdrawals, and you might incur penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Your financial situation, goals, and market conditions may change, so it's essential to reevaluate your asset allocation periodically.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be helpful to discuss your specific situation with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

Consider your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications as you make your distribution plan.
