DISTRIBUTING YOUR MONEY AMONG YOUR 401(K), IRA, AND TAXABLE ACCOUNTS REQUIRES STRATEGY AND UNDERSTANDING YOUR GOALS. HERE’S A TOUGH LOVE APPROACH:

1. **MAX OUT YOUR 401(K)**: IF YOUR EMPLOYER OFFERS MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS, FILL THAT UP FIRST LIKE IT'S YOUR LAST MEAL. THAT'S FREE MONEY, DON’T SQUANDER IT!

2. **CONTRIBUTE TO AN IRA**: AFTER MAXING OUT YOUR 401(K), TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO AN IRA—TRADITIONAL OR ROTH. TRADITIONAL GIVES YOU A TAX DEFERRED ADVANTAGE; ROTH HELPS YOU WITH TAX-FREE WITHDRAWALS IN RETIREMENT. CHOOSE BASED ON YOUR CURRENT TAX BRACKET AND EXPECTED FUTURE BRACKET.

3. **TAXABLE ACCOUNTS FOR FLEXIBILITY**: USE THESE FOR MONEY YOU MIGHT NEED SOONER. INVESTMENTS HERE DON’T LOCK YOU IN LIKE RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. REMEMBER, YOU’LL PAY CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON PROFIT, SO CHOOSE YOUR INVESTMENTS WISELY.

4. **BALANCE RISK AND RETURN**: DIVERSIFY ACROSS DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES (STOCKS, BONDS, FUNDS) IN ALL ACCOUNTS BASED ON YOUR RISK TOLERANCE AND TIME HORIZON. DON’T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET—UNLESS YOU WANT TO WATCH THEM SPLATTER!

5. **REVIEW AND REBALANCE**: DON’T JUST SET IT AND FORGET IT. CHECK YOUR ACCOUNTS REGULARLY AND ADJUST AS NEEDED TO STAY ON TRACK WITH YOUR GOALS.

IN THE END, IT’S ALL ABOUT BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND MAKING SURE YOU’RE NOT LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE. GET IT TOGETHER AND GET THRIVING!
