TO EFFECTIVELY TARGET YOUNG VOTERS, YOU NEED TO GET INTO THEIR WORLD. HERE ARE SOME STRATEGIES:

1. **USE SOCIAL MEDIA:** ENGAGE ON PLATFORMS LIKE INSTAGRAM, TIKTOK, AND SNAPCHAT. CREATE VIBRANT, SHAREABLE CONTENT THAT RESONATES WITH THEIR VALUES.

2. **COLLABORATE WITH INFLUENCERS:** PARTNER WITH INFLUENCERS OR COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO ALREADY HAVE THEIR TRUST. AUTHENTICITY IS KEY!

3. **FOCUS ON ISSUES THAT MATTER:** ADDRESS TOPICS LIKE STUDENT LOANS, CLIMATE CHANGE, SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES—THINGS YOUNG PEOPLE CARE ABOUT.

4. **ORGANIZE EVENTS:** HOST CONCERTS, RALLIES, OR CASUAL GATHERINGS WHERE YOUNG VOTERS CAN CONNECT WITH CAMPAIGNERS AND EACH OTHER.

5. **MAKE VOTING EASY:** PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HOW TO REGISTER, WHERE TO VOTE, AND MOBILIZE TRANSPORTATION ARRANGEMENTS. SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS.

6. **BE AUTHENTIC:** YOUNG PEOPLE CAN SPOT BULLSHIT A MILE AWAY. STAY TRUTHFUL AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT YOUR MESSAGES AND GOALS.

BRING THE HEAT, AND DON’T SHY AWAY FROM A LITTLE HUMOR OR EDGE—THAT RESONATES WITH THEM!
