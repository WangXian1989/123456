WHEN IT COMES TO DISTRIBUTING YOUR MONEY AMONG A 401(K), IRA, AND TAXABLE ACCOUNTS, FACTORS LIKE YOUR AGE, RISK TOLERANCE, AND FINANCIAL GOALS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE. HERE'S A STRATEGY TO CONSIDER:

1. **MAX OUT EMPLOYER MATCH:** FIRST, FOCUS ON YOUR 401(K). CONTRIBUTE AT LEAST ENOUGH TO GET THE FULL EMPLOYER MATCH—IT’S FREE MONEY!

2. **CONTRIBUTE TO IRA:** AFTER MAXIMIZING YOUR 401(K) MATCH, CONSIDER CONTRIBUTING TO A TRADITIONAL OR ROTH IRA. THIS PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TAX ADVANTAGES.

3. **FUND THE 401(K):** ONCE YOU'VE CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR IRA, FOCUS BACK ON YOUR 401(K) TO REACH THE ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMIT IF POSSIBLE.

4. **TAXABLE ACCOUNTS FOR FLEXIBILITY:** AFTER MAXING OUT YOUR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS, CONSIDER PUTTING EXTRA FUNDS IN A TAXABLE ACCOUNT FOR GREATER LIQUIDITY AND FLEXIBILITY.

5. **PROPORTIONATE ALLOCATION:** DIVERSIFY INVESTMENTS ACROSS ALL ACCOUNTS BASED ON RISK TOLERANCE. HIGHER RISK ASSETS (LIKE STOCKS) ARE BETTER SUITED FOR TAX-ADVANTAGED ACCOUNTS, WHILE LOWER RISK ASSETS CAN BE KEPT IN TAXABLE ACCOUNTS TO MINIMIZE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES.

6. **REVIEW REGULARLY:** REGULARLY REASSESS YOUR ALLOCATION TO ENSURE IT ALIGNES WITH YOUR GOALS AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

STAY INFORMED AND ADAPT AS NECESSARY!
