Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach for optimal tax efficiency and growth. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that’s essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that produce lower tax burdens (like long-term capital gains) or for money you might need before retirement. Be mindful of when you sell assets to avoid unnecessary taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Allocate investments based on risk tolerance. Typically, stocks are better in tax-advantaged accounts due to higher potential growth and tax rates on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Bonds and Dividends:** Consider holding bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest and dividends.

### Conclusion:
   - Prioritize maxing employer-sponsored plans and IRAs, then focus on taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Recommended Approach:
- **Allocate around 15-20% of your income to your 401(k)**
- **Contribute to your IRA (up to the maximum allowed)**
- **Invest any remaining funds in your taxable accounts, focusing on long-term strategies** 

This method can help ensure long-term growth and tax efficiency.
