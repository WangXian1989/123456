(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. A general recommendation would be to maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider fully funding an IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. If you've maxed out those options and have additional funds, you can invest in taxable accounts. It is often advisable to keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (such as IRAs and 401(k)s) while keeping more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability. Itâ€™s always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s talk strategy! First off, if your 401(k) has a company match, throw as much as you can at that thingâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table, that's just silly! Once thatâ€™s maxed out, jump into your IRA for some sweet tax-deferred action, where your investments can grow without the government snooping on you until you withdraw. 

After you've milked those two options dry, dive into those taxable accounts. Hereâ€™s a nifty hack: keep your high-growth stocks in taxable accounts because they get taxed at the capital gains rate rather than your ordinary income rate. Meanwhile, stuff those tax-inefficient investments like bonds into your IRAs. Get fancy with it, consider your risk level and how soon you want to access the money. And hey, donâ€™t hesitate to grab a financial advisor if you want a proâ€™s edge!
