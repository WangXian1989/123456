Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a strategy you could consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice here depends on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account. This provides liquidity and flexibility since you can withdraw from it at any time without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure that your investments are diversified appropriately based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Typically, you may want to hold higher-risk investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or deferred, while holding more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired level of risk and alignment with your financial goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy tailored to your specific financial situation.
