The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax benefits**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your 401(k) offers a Roth option, consider how your current tax rate compares to your expected future tax rate.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Account type choice**: A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions upfront, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice depends on whether you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution limit**: Keep track of the contribution limits for IRAs, and ensure that youâ€™re taking full advantage of these accounts before directing funds to taxable accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts do not have contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, making them a good option for shorter-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider keeping investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

### General Strategy:

- **Prioritize accounts**: Start by ensuring you are contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA before funding a taxable account.
- **Diversify investments**: Across all accounts, aim to diversify your investments to spread risk while achieving your growth objectives.
- **Rebalance periodically**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): 15-20% of your income until you reach the employer match.
- IRA: Up to the maximum annual contribution limit (e.g., $6,000 for individuals under 50 in 2023).
- Taxable accounts: Any additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts, focusing on short-term goals.
