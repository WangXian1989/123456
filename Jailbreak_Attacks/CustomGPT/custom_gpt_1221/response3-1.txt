The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Type of Account:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are typically pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars but offer tax-free qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains annually.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, favor a Roth IRA or taxable accounts.
   - If your tax rate will likely be lower in retirement, prioritize traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions to take advantage of tax deferral.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any available employer matching contributions, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 4. **Focus on Retirement Accounts First:**
   - Try to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts typically have higher growth potential due to tax advantages.

### 5. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider higher growth investments, such as stocks.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to manage capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:**
   - Review your asset allocation in each account regularly based on your risk tolerance, market conditions, and life changes (like marriage, children, or new jobs).

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy (Hypothetical):
1. **401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
   - Aim for 15-20% of your salary if possible.

2. **IRA:**
   - Max out annual contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
   - If contribution limits are reached, move to taxable accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Any remaining funds after maxing out retirement accounts can be invested here.
   - Use this for short-term goals or additional investing.

### Conclusion:
The ideal distribution often involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, especially with employer matching, and then considering your taxable investments last. Regular reassessment ensures your strategy remains aligned with changing financial landscapes.
