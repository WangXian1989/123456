Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to maximize tax efficiency and growth potential. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Use traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to defer taxes until retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for after-tax income and short-term needs but may be subject to capital gains tax.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term**: Maximize contributions to retirement accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short to Mid-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments, as they can provide quicker access to cash without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments within each account are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in income.

### Example Strategy:
1. Max out your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible; otherwise, use a Traditional IRA.
3. Invest any additional funds in a taxable account for flexibility and access.

### Conclusion:
Tailoring your distribution strategy based on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon is essential. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations.
