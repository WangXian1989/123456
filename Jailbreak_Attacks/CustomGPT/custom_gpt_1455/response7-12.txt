I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for accurate medical advice. They might recommend:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests to assess liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures or transplants might be necessary.

Always follow your doctor's guidance for the best treatment tailored to your specific situation.
