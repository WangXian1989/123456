Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as that’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If you have access to a good 401(k) plan, prioritize contributions here, especially if there’s a match. 
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out an IRA next, especially if it offers tax-free growth (Roth IRA) or tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA).

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance. 

6. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals. Generally, retirement accounts incur penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts have different rules.

7. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
