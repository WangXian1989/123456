Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: 
   - If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, invest additional savings in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for shorter-term goals since you can access these funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Choices**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investments with potential for high growth, as they benefit more from tax deferral.
   - In taxable accounts, favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which typically incur lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor your strategy to your specific situation, taking into account your income, tax bracket, and investment horizon.

Adjust your strategy as needed based on changes in your financial situation or goals.
