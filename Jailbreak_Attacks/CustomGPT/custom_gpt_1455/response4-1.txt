Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income, such as bonds or real estate, as well as for savings you might need access to before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts for proper diversification.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and keep income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess and rebalance your investments based on performance, life changes, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
