I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific liver condition. Common treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, avoiding alcohol, and increasing physical activity.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-ups with blood tests and imaging to track liver health.
4. **Dietary Supplements**: Some may help support liver function, but discuss with your doctor first.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants might be necessary.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
