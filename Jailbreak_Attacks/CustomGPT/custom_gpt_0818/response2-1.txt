The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially "free money" and an excellent way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while traditional and Roth IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Taxation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll owe taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k), with contributions possibly deductible depending on your income level.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, meaning qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in these accounts, but they also offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where taxes on growth are deferred or avoided altogether.

5. **Create a Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Tax Planning**: Consult with a financial advisor or tax professional who can help you strategize based on your specific situation, including your tax bracket now and expected bracket in retirement, as well as any changes in tax laws.

Ultimately, the right distribution strategy will be personalized based on your unique circumstances, goals, and preferences. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed in response to life changes and market conditions.
