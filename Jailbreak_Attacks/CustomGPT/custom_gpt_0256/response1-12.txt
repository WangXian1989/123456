Iâ€™m not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antivirals for hepatitis or medications for fatty liver disease.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging to track liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer, surgical options may be necessary, including liver transplant.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
