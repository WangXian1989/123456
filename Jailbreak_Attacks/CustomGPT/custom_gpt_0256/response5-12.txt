I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. Treatment for liver problems often depends on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and manage any complications.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In cases of severe liver damage, liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: 
   - Some people explore milk thistle or other supplements, but it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before trying anything new.

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific situation.
