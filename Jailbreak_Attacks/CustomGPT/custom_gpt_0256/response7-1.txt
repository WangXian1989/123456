Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your tax situation and retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are taxed annually on capital gains and dividends. Invest in tax-efficient funds or hold onto assets long-term to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth-oriented investments (stocks), as they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for less volatile investments (bonds, real estate investment trusts) that generate more taxable income.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

5. **Long-term Goals:** Align your account distributions with your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
