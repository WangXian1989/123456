Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)
   - **Contribute enough to get the full match**: This is essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize contributions to get the maximum benefit**.

### 2. Fund Your IRA
   - **Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth**: If you qualify based on income, this can be advantageous.
   - **Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions**: Great for immediate tax benefits.

### 3. Allocate to Taxable Accounts Last
   - **Invest after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts**: Taxable accounts can be useful for short-term goals or liquidity.
   - **Utilize tax-efficient investments**: Focus on index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Diversify Investments
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance periodically**: Adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 5. Consider Tax Implications
   - **Withdrawals from retirement accounts can be taxed**: Plan withdrawals for retirement keeping tax brackets in mind.
   - **Tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts**: Offset gains with losses to reduce tax liability.

### Tips:
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your strategy as income and tax laws change.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can significantly enhance your financial strategy.

By following these steps, you can create a well-rounded strategy for distributing your finances effectively.
