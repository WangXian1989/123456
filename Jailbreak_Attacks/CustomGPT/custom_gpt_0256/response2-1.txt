Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If possible, max out your contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax preferences.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains are taxed when realized, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement in 20+ years), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - For shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a house in 5 years), consider taxable accounts for more liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate riskier assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Place lower-risk assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough for the employer match, then prioritize IRA contributions.
- **IRA**: Max out if you're eligible for a Roth; otherwise, use a traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds, focusing on long-term holdings to minimize tax impact.

Remember to adjust this strategy based on your personal situation and consult with a financial advisor if needed.
