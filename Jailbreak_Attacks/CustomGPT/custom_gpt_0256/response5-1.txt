To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money." Aim to max out the contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute up to the limit. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, so consider it if you're eligible based on income.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks), where they can benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Bonds/Income Generating Assets**: Consider placing these in taxable accounts, as interest income can be taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Choose investments with lower turnover (like ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid immediate tax hits.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw funds. Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first to manage your tax bracket effectively.

5. **Rebalancing and Review**:
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
