To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax contributions which reduce taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions if your plan has high-quality investment options.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for funds you may need before retirement. They have fewer tax advantages but offer flexibility. Use for investments that generate lower capital gains or have tax-efficient strategies.

4. **Consider Investment Goals**: Align asset allocation with your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This strategy aims to balance tax efficiency, liquidity, and growth potential.
