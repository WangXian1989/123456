Balancing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing growth and minimizing taxes. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Fund a Roth or Traditional IRA, prioritizing contributions based on your current versus expected future tax rates.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in a variety of assets that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income, such as index funds or ETFs, to optimize for lower tax rates on long-term gains.

### Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the investment types (stocks, bonds) based on your comfort with risk.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can typically afford more risk in growth-oriented assets.

### Example Allocation Goals:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses set aside in a liquid account.
- **Retirement Focus**:
  - 401(k): 50%
  - IRA: 30%
  - Taxable Accounts: 20%

Assess your financial goals regularly and adjust contributions as needed.
