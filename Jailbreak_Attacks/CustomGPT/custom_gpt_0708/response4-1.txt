To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**: After securing the match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed. For 2023, the standard limit is $22,500 (plus $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for 2023 is $6,500 (plus $1,000 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits, but taxes are due upon withdrawal.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, but interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. 

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Periodically review your allocation. As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice to align your strategy with your financial goals and current tax situation.

By following this plan, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while ensuring liquidity and growth potential.
