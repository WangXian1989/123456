I can't provide specific medical advice, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional to discuss treatment options for liver problems. They can offer guidance based on your condition, medical history, and overall health. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or more advanced therapies, depending on the issue. Always prioritize professional medical advice.
