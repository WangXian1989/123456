Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. The tax deferral benefits and potential for employer contributions make it a powerful retirement savings tool.

2. **IRA Considerations**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions (depending on your income), while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, assuming certain conditions are met. Decide based on your current versus expected future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement, or for regular income needs. These accounts can hold a variety of investments and offer more flexibility, but be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k)/IRA) and less aggressive investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts due to their different tax treatments.

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your distribution strategy regularly as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions evolve.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
