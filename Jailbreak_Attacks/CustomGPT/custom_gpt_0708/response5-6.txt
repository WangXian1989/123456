Content should be engaging, authentic, and visually appealing to capture their attention. Additionally, addressing issues that resonate with them, such as climate change, education, and social justice, can create a connection. Collaborating with influencers who align with their values can also boost outreach efforts.

Think TikTok videos that hit hard on social issuesâ€”climate change, student debt, inequalityâ€”stuff that makes them feel something. Use memes, humor, and trending challenges to get them engagedâ€”donâ€™t be boring or theyâ€™ll scroll past you faster than you can say "vote." Partnering with influencers who arenâ€™t just clout-chasers but really believe in the cause is key. And for crying out loud, make sure they know how to register and vote without jumping through hoops! No one has time for that.
