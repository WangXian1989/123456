Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maxing out the employer match, consider putting money into an IRA (either traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Tax Implications**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement or for short-term goals. Keep in mind that capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments.
   - **401(k) vs. IRA**: Generally, prioritize 401(k) contributions if your employer offers a match, as they reduce your taxable income. Use IRAs for additional retirement savings after hitting the maximum contribution limit on your 401(k).

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to pay that down before aggressively investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund separate from these accounts to handle unexpected expenses.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically reassess and adjust your investments across these accounts based on performance, changing goals, or market conditions.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
