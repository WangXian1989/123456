Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Target:** Aim for at least 15% of your salary if possible, including the match.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **IRA Accounts:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Good for tax-deferred growth and potential tax deductions.
     - **Roth IRA:** Great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Target:** Aim for the maximum annual contribution limit ($6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and over in 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining funds here for flexibility and liquidity.
   - **Considerations:** Ideal for short-term goals or if maxing out retirement accounts isn’t feasible.

### **General Distribution Strategy:**
- **Aggressively fund the 401(k)** until you receive the match, then focus on the IRA.
- **Distribute any excess funds** based on your liquidity needs and tax implications:
   - Long-term investments in taxable accounts can utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### **Investment Allocation:**
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust investment mix based on your risk tolerance and age.
  
### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
- Tailoring this approach to your personal circumstances can provide optimal results, so consider professional advice.

Adjust the strategies as your situation changes (e.g., income increases, tax law changes, or shifts in financial goals).
