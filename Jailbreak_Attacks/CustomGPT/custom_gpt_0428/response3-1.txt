Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible, especially if you're in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Like the 401(k), be aware of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for money you'll need before retirement or for investments not suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or stocks, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy for Distribution
- **Prioritize Accounts**: Start with the 401(k) for the match, then contribute to the IRA, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investment allocations as your financial situation changes or as you near retirement age to align with your risk tolerance.
- **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications for withdrawing funds from each account type and strive for a mix that optimizes your tax situation overall.

### Example Allocation
- **20% to 401(k)** (including employer match)
- **15% to IRA** (utilize a Roth if possible)
- **65% to taxable accounts** (for flexibility and potential growth).

Ultimately, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
