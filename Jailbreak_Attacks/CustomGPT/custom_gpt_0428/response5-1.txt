(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation according to market changes and your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to slice your money pie into a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on the flavor of tax benefits you want and when you plan to dig into those funds. Hereâ€™s a spicy take:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, go hardâ€”get that free cash! Put enough in to snag the full match and then stop stressing about it.

2. **IRA Next**: If you can swing it, toss some dollars into a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on whether you want to pay taxes now or later. Roths are sweet because they get tax-free withdrawalsâ€”who doesn't love that?

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've maxed out retirement stuff, throw some cash into taxable accounts for flexibility. Just be smartâ€”these are taxed, so stick to investments that wonâ€™t sting too much, like index funds with low turnover.

4. **Check-In Regularly**: Life changesâ€”your investments should too. Rebalance based on market shifts or when your goals change.

And hey, if all this feels like too much, holla at a financial advisor to get tailored advice. You got this!
