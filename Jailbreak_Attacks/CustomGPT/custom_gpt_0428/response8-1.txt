To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has specific contribution limits. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

2. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Consider this account for higher-income years.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you can either receive tax benefits now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth). Evaluate your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility and are taxed differently. Capital gains tax on investments held for over a year is usually lower than ordinary income tax.

4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since the funds will be tied up until retirement. Consider diversified index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider holding investments long enough to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically based on performance, risk tolerance, and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Your Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your short-term and long-term financial goals, such as retirement, home purchase, or education funding.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.

This approach ensures a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy tailored to your retirement goals.
