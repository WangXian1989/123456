Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed ($22,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023, or $30,000 for those 50 and over).

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing here for the tax deduction now.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth where your withdrawals will be tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 in 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After Tax Savings:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from long-term capital gains (which are taxed at a lower rate) or tax-efficient index funds.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** These accounts should hold funds readily available for shorter-term goals or emergencies.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts first (401(k) and IRA)**
- **Diversify your investments** across accounts while considering the tax implications of each.
- **Reassess regularly:** Your situation may change, so adjust contributions based on income fluctuations, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.
