Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - The 401(k) typically provides tax advantages that can help grow your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. 
   - A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you've maxed out these retirement accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account.
   - This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA or 401(k) might be more beneficial. A Roth option could be better if you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be balanced according to your risk tolerance and investment time frame.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and allocations, especially as your financial situation changes or as you near retirement.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
