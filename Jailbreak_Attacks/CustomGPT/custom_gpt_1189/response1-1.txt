Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Contribute to Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**
   - After securing the match, consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA each year. As of 2023, the limits are:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older)
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older)

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider a Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer more flexibility and liquidity. They’re ideal for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out retirement accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like Roth IRAs) to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Be mindful of tax implications to minimize your tax burden.

### 6. **Reassess Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

### Summary
A common approach is to focus first on getting the employer match in your 401(k), then maxing out retirement accounts, and finally using taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. Tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation and future plans. Consulting with a financial advisor might also be beneficial for personalized advice.
