The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general framework to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before allocating to retirement accounts.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are pre-tax and reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), but check income limits for deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for goals not tied to retirement, or for investments you may want to access sooner.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Adjust the types of investments in each account. For example, consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where you can defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments and for income-generating investments like bonds or REITs, since interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting contributions as necessary based on performance and changing goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances can significantly enhance your strategy.

This approach balances short-term needs with long-term growth and tax efficiency.
