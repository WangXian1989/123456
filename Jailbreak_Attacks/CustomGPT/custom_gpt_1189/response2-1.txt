Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions:** If eligible, max out traditional or Roth IRA contributions. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly impact long-term growth.
   - **Contribute Above Match to 401(k):** After maxing the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) if you can, especially if your tax bracket is higher.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts provide liquidity and flexibility, allowing for withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Strategies**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Municipal Bonds:** If you’re in a higher tax bracket, consider municipal bonds in taxable accounts for tax-free interest.

### 5. **Investment Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, regardless of account type. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets should align with your goals.

### 6. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**
   - Revisit your strategy annually or as your financial situation changes. Adjust contributions based on tax law changes, retirement goals, or market conditions.

### Summary
1. Maximize employer match in 401(k).
2. Contribute to IRAs (traditional or Roth).
3. Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility.
4. Use tax-efficient strategies for taxable accounts.
5. Diversify your investments across all account types.
