To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from their tax advantages. The choice between a traditional or Roth IRA depends on your current versus expected future tax rates.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: These are ideal for holding investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) or for long-term growth investments that you donâ€™t plan to sell for many years.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) or for money you may need access to before retirement without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before aggressively investing. Typically, 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account can provide a safety net.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep a diverse portfolio within each account type, balancing risk across your investments according to your age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Stocks are generally preferred in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while bonds may be better suited for taxable accounts due to their interest income.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure about your strategy or specific investments, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial situation.

This balanced approach can help maximize your potential growth while optimizing your tax situation over time.
