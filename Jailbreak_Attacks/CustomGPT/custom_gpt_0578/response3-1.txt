Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**:
   - If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Debt**:
   - If you have high-interest debt (like credit card debt), focus on paying that down first, as the interest can outweigh investment returns.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you've contributed adequately to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable brokerage accounts. They provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be good for intermediate-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts according to your risk tolerance—consider stocks, bonds, and other asset classes to balance growth and risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investment portfolio regularly and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Think about your current and expected future tax brackets. In some cases, it might make sense to focus on tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

8. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs last.

Every individual’s situation is different, so consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific financial circumstances and long-term goals.
