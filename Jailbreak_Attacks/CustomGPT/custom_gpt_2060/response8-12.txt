I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver issues that might be helpful. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Supplements**: Some people find benefits from supplements like milk thistle, but you should discuss this with your doctor first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track your condition.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or transplantation may be necessary.

Always seek advice from a healthcare professional for any liver issues.
