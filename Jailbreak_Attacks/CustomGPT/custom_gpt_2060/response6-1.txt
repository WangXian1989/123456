To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Tax Implications
- **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred; ideal for higher-income years.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax; best for short-term needs.

### 2. Assess Your Goals and Timeline
- **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first for long-term growth.
- **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and cash based on risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 4. Maximize Contributions
- **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Annual Limits**: Contribute to IRAs and Roths up to the annual limits to enhance tax advantages.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50% of retirement savings 
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: 30% for tax-free growth
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% for immediate access 

### Conclusion
Balance your contributions based on tax strategies and financial goals while ensuring proper diversification. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing circumstances.
