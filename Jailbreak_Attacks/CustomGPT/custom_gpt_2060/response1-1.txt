Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Retirement Accounts First**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Then, max out your IRA contributions if eligible.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax or tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now but may be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These give you flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: If you’re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, taxable accounts may be more accessible.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor is also a good idea to tailor the strategy to your specific situation!
