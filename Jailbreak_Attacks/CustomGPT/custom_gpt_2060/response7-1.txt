Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) (especially if it has a match) and IRA due to their tax benefits.
   - **Types of IRAs**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 3. **Diversify Investment Options:**
   - **401(k)**: Often limited in investment choices. Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, or funds that match your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers a broader range of investment options, such as ETFs and real estate. Use this flexibility to diversify further.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or qualified dividends for more favorable tax treatment.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity aside from retirement accounts. An emergency fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it’s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

### 7. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20%
- **IRA**: 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-20%

Adjust these percentages based on your income, age, and financial goals.
