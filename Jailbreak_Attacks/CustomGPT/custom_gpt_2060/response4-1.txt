Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the tax implications of each account. Here's a breakdown of the best strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max out contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Focus on growth**: Since 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, investments can grow tax-deferred. Consider a mixture of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Prioritize funding**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can benefit from Roth IRA tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Using both a Traditional and a Roth IRA can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-tax savings**: Use these for short- to mid-term goals. They offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.
   - **Tax-efficient investments**: Focus on long-term capital gains investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-term needs**: Keep sufficient funds in a taxable account.
- **Retirement savings**: Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
- **Long-term growth**: Use a diversified mix of stocks in your retirement accounts and maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation.
