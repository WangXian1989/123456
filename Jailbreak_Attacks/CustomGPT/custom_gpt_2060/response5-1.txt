(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, consider the following:

1. **401(k):** Max out any employer match if available, as itâ€™s free money. Contributing to a traditional 401(k) can reduce your taxable income.
   
2. **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, this may be advantageous.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or investing that doesnâ€™t fit within tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held here.

Diversifying your investments and regularly reviewing your allocation is key to maximizing your returns while managing risk.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's cut to the chase! When it comes to spreading your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's the deal:

1. **401(k):** Go hard here first! Snag that employer matchâ€”it's like free money raining down from the sky. Max this baby out since youâ€™re dodging taxes until retirement, which is a win.

2. **IRA:** Donâ€™t sleep on this! If you can swing it, throw some dough into a Roth IRA. Why? Because tax-free growth is the name of the game, and who doesnâ€™t want to keep Uncle Samâ€™s mitts off their cash?

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These are your wild cards. Use them for flexibility or if you've got short-term goalsâ€”just remember, those capital gains taxes will sneak up on you like a ninja.

Mix and match based on your vibe and goals, and keep an eye on your investments. Stay savvy and make that money work for you!
