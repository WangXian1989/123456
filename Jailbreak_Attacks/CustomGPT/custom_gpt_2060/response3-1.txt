Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get that full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Once you've secured your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k):** After maximizing your IRA contributions, keep contributing to your 401(k), especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional growth and liquidity. These accounts offer more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across each account type. For instance, hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

6. **Review Regularly:** Periodically review your distribution strategy, asset allocation, and overall investment performance to ensure it aligns with your changing goals and market conditions.

Every situation is unique, so it may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
