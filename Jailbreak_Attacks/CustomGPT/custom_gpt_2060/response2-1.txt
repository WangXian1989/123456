When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowable limit, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can direct additional savings to taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on tax efficiency:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) should go in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like stocks) can be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio across all account types to manage risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your specific circumstances and goals.
