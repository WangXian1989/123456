To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual maximum if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to both Traditional and Roth IRAs. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth. Use bonds and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable tax treatment on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Consider Risk Tolerance:** Balance your portfolio according to your risk appetite and investment horizon. Younger investors may lean more toward stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds.

### 3. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking advantage of market fluctuations.

### Conclusion:
- By strategically allocating funds among these accounts, you can enhance growth potential while minimizing tax burdens. Adjust your approach as your financial situation and market conditions change. 

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
