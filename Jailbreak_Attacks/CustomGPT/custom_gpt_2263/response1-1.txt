Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key factors. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, consider paying off any high-interest debt, as the returns from investment may not outweigh interest costs.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Focus on bonds or high-dividend stocks here to avoid immediate tax liabilities. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold assets that generate less taxable income (like growth stocks) for long-term growth.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account to balance risk while considering your investment timeline.

6. **Revisit Your Strategy**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, life circumstances, or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
