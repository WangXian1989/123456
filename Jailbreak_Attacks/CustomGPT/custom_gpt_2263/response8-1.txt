Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general tips:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute the maximum to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) for tax advantages.
  
2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on higher-income and volatile investments in 401(k) and Traditional IRA accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments likely to generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Investment Types:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Consider holding bonds and other income-generating assets here, as withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor long-term growth stocks or ETFs to minimize turnover and tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan withdrawals based on your tax situation, utilizing tax-advantaged accounts first to minimize overall tax burden in retirement.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks.
