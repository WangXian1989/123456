Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet, reducing fats and sugars.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Limit or eliminate alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Liver Supplements**: Some may recommend supplements like milk thistle, but consult with a doctor first.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Follow-up Tests**: Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, surgical options like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek medical advice for the best course of action tailored to your specific condition.
