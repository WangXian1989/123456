To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approaches:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, fully fund a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Risk and Liquidity**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or emergency funds. Consider lower-risk investments (e.g., bonds or dividend stocks) to avoid high tax implications.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon, ensuring a mix of stock, bonds, and other assets across all account types.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Aim for higher-growth investments, as taxes on withdrawals will apply later.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

By strategically distributing your funds and optimizing for growth while managing tax implications, you can enhance your long-term retirement savings.
