It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver health. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition, but common approaches include lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, surgical interventions. A healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and managing underlying conditions like diabetes or obesity are often recommended. Always seek medical advice from a licensed practitioner for the best course of action.
