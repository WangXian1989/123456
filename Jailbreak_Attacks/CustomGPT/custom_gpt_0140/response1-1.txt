The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax benefits upfront.

3. **Balance Tax Implications**: Fund your accounts based on tax efficiency:
    - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Good for high-income years since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
    - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
    - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for better tax treatment.

4. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Ensure your investment allocations align with your risk tolerance and time horizon in each account.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review your accounts regularly to ensure they stay aligned with your goals and adjust contributions as needed.
