To optimize your investment strategy using a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers matching contributions in the 401(k).

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, this is the best place for high-income investments since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for potentially tax-free growth, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income. 

3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your asset allocation needs in each account. For example:
   - Place more aggressive investments (higher risk, higher return potential) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable, lower-risk investments that generate qualified dividends.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, develop a withdrawal strategy that maintains tax efficiency. This might involve prioritizing withdrawals from taxable accounts first.

5. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investment performance and rebalance your portfolios as needed, ensuring you're aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while minimizing tax implications and aligning with your long-term financial goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
