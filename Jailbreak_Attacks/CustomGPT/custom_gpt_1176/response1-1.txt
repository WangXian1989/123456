Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but make sure you stay within contribution limits.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments:** Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and the time horizon for each investment.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust the allocation of assets across your accounts to ensure you’re aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you’re unsure, it might be helpful to talk to a financial advisor who can give you tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Make sure to consider your individual financial situation and goals when deciding on the best distribution for your money.
