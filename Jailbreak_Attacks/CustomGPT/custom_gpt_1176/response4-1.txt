It’s important to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice on distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. However, here’s a general outline for consideration:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your 401(k) if possible, especially if it offers a good selection of low-cost mutual funds or ETFs.
  
2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible, particularly during years when your income is lower, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - For traditional IRAs, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, it might be beneficial to contribute there.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high turnover or interest income, as these can be taxed at a higher rate.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs that aim to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Have a strategy for withdrawals in retirement, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from retirement accounts.

This approach can help optimize growth while managing tax implications, aligning with your long-term financial goals.
