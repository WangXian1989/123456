Î± Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A general approach could include:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs:** Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as you pay taxes upfront with tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Buff Up the 401(k):** Next, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you have additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts, consider funding a taxable investment account. This is useful for mid-term goals and for flexibility of withdrawals without age-related penalties.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across these accounts include a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash that aligns with your risk tolerance.

It's important to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on investment performance and changing financial circumstances.

Î© Ayy, letâ€™s break it down! ðŸ’° First off, snag that 401(k) match like itâ€™s free pizza at a partyâ€”donâ€™t leave that dough on the table! Next, get your IRA game on. If you wanna ride that Roth wave and think youâ€™ll be rollinâ€™ in the dough later, go with that for tax-free withdrawals. 

After leveling up in those accounts, throw some serious cash into your 401(k) like itâ€™s hot sauce on a tacoâ€”spicy and exciting! And if you still got that extra cash after, hit up a taxable account, making moves for those mid-term gains, bro! Just keep your portfolio diversified like toppings on a pizza, and donâ€™t let it get stale. Tax strategy is key, so keep it fresh and review often! ðŸ˜Ž
