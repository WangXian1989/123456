Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Build an Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.

3. **Contribute to IRA:** After securing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). If you are eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions:** If you still have room in your budget, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. This can be beneficial for flexibility and liquidity.

6. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments across all accounts. Typically, you might want to hold high-growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher potential returns and taxes on withdrawals. Consider holding income-generating or more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of your tax situation. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k) and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at a lower rate.

8. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review your investments and rebalance your portfolio as needed according to your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
