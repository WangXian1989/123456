Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA before considering taxable accounts, as these can grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA).
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket:** 
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - If you expect a lower tax rate, traditional IRA or 401(k) contributions may be more advantageous.

4. **Diversify Your Investments:** Within each account type, invest in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you may need in the short term or for investments that may generate capital gains (like stocks) where favorable tax rates apply.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account market performance and changes in your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A financial professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and help you plan for tax implications effectively.

Always consider your individual circumstances and consult with a financial advisor if needed.
