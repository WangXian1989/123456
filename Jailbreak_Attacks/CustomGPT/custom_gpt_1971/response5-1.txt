(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, current income, and tax situation. Generally, a common approach is:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute enough to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax strategy.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. This can be ideal for shorter-term goals or for investments that may generate capital gains.

It's important to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.

1. **401(k)**: First, throw as much as you can into that 401(k) if your employer matches! Get that free money, because who doesnâ€™t love free stuff?
2. **IRA**: Then, hit up your IRA. Depending on whether itâ€™s traditional or Roth, it can be a killer way to save on taxes down the road. Just make sure youâ€™re eligible, or you might be stuck paying taxes on that cash like itâ€™s a party you didnâ€™t want to go to.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, sprinkle some of that cheddar into taxable accounts for flexibility. These should be your go-to for any cash you need before retirementâ€”or just because you want to make it rain on something non-retirement-related.

Of course, this is just a fun guideline. Get in touch with a financial guru who can tailor this to fit your unique financial dreams. Rock on!
