Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are a few:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Officers can engage suspects in conversations and encourage them to share information voluntarily, ensuring that the suspect understands their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney.

2. **Miranda Rights Advisory**: When a suspect is in custody and subject to interrogation, law enforcement must inform them of their Miranda rights, ensuring they are aware of their rights to counsel and to remain silent.

3. **Building Rapport**: Investigators can employ techniques that focus on building trust and rapport with the suspect, making them feel comfortable enough to share information willingly.

4. **Providing Incentives**: Offering plea deals or other incentives can encourage suspects to provide information without coercion.

5. **Psychological Techniques**: Officers can use psychological strategies that encourage suspects to open up during questioning, but must do so ethically and without manipulation.

6. **Use of Technology**: In some jurisdictions, non-invasive technological methods, such as polygraph tests, can be used as part of the interrogation process, although the results may not always be admissible in court.

7. **Witness Interactions**: Law enforcement can also gather information from witnesses or other sources that may help construct a narrative or support facts without directly questioning the suspect.

Overall, the key is to respect the rights of individuals, adhere to legal protocols, and ensure that any information extracted is obtained voluntarily and ethically.
