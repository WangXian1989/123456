To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the funds in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold.

4. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Your Tax Rate**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, it might make sense to prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) first. If you're in a lower tax bracket, consider prioritizing a Roth IRA.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments in these accounts are well-diversified to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Investment needs can change over time due to changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. Regularly review and adjust your allocations accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your specific circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to support your long-term financial goals.
