Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contribution:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, if eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Balance Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividend income, as they may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a diverse mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Withdrawal Sequencing:** Plan for different tax implications when withdrawing funds in retirement (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first may optimize tax efficiency).

### Summary
1. **Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.**
2. **Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and financial goals.**

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
