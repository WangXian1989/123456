The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider investing in an IRA (preferably a Roth if you qualify and expect your income to increase), as it offers tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve funded your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance:
   - **401(k)**: Consider more aggressive investments, as these are usually long-term.
   - **IRA**: Mix of growth and income-focused investments.
   - **Taxable**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize taxable gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your allocation stays aligned with your goals by reviewing and rebalancing your investments periodically.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy based on your retirement timeline and tax bracket, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

It’s often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that aligns with your specific goals and circumstances.
