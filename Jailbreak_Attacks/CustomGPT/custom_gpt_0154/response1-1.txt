To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth) for tax advantages.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, direct additional funds to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: For any remaining funds, invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Balance taxable investments and tax-advantaged accounts according to your expected retirement tax bracket.

6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments are diversified based on risk tolerance and goals across all accounts.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your allocation as your financial situation or market conditions change.

This strategy helps optimize tax efficiency and growth potential over time. Always consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
