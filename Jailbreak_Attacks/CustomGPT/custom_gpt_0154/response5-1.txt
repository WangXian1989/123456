Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. Consider a Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like long-term capital gains) and those that have less frequent trading.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds). Since these accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free, you can potentially benefit more from compounding interest.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly some tax-efficient funds to manage taxes better.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in any of the accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Adjust your allocations based on market changes, life events, or shifts in your financial goals.

### Conclusion
A typical approach might be:
- Max out 401(k) contributions first.
- Then contribute to an IRA.
- Finally, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency and liquidity.
