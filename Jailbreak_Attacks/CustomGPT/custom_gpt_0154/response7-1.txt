To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Utilize Tax Advantages:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. For example, in 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes. Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on dividends and interest.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, develop a withdrawal strategy that minimizes taxes. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help manage tax brackets effectively.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This helps manage risk while taking advantage of potential returns.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and performance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to create a personalized investment strategy that meets your specific financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions and optimizing your investments across these accounts, you can enhance your overall financial health.
