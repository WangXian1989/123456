Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible; it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable events (like bonds or actively managed funds) to avoid high taxes in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Maintain your desired asset allocation by rebalance periodically based on performance and market conditions.

5. **Plan Withdrawals Strategically**:
   - In retirement, consider the tax implications of withdrawals. Typically, it may be wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first before tapping into tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - To ensure your specific situation is considered, consulting a financial professional can provide personalized guidance.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so tailor your strategy accordingly.
