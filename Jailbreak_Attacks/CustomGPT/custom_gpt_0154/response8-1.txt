Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be advantageous.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) but can offer more investment choices. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Great for younger investors or those expecting higher tax rates in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Best for short-term goals or investments that may not benefit from tax-deferred growth. 
   - Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but you have more flexibility regarding withdrawals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

- **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: Aim for the maximum contribution limit, especially to capture any employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for additional savings beyond your tax-advantaged accounts or for investments you may need to access in the short term.

### Regularly Review and Adjust:

- **Rebalance Portfolio**: Assess your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
- **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about when and how you'll withdraw the money, as this can impact your tax situation in retirement.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances and goals.
