I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthier diet low in fats and sugars, stay hydrated, and maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly benefit liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

5. **Supplements and Vitamins**: Sometimes, doctors recommend specific supplements, but this should be done under professional guidance.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
