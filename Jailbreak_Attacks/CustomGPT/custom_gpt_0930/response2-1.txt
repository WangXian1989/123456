Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy for allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maxing out employer match, focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional depending on your preference).

4. **Use Your Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors can take more risks, while those nearing retirement may want to be more conservative.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and meet your investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

By following this strategy, you can create a balanced investment distribution that supports your financial goals while optimizing for taxes.
