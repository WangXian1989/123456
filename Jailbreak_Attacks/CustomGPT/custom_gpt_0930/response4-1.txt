Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, time horizon, and individual financial situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’re maximizing your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you have a high-income tax bracket and want to lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any funds you have after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts can be allocated to taxable accounts. This can also provide flexibility, as you can withdraw from these accounts without penalties.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place investments that are likely to generate high taxes (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and those that are more tax-efficient (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on market performance and changes in your personal situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your specific financial landscape, consulting with a financial planner can be beneficial.

By strategically allocating your investments, you can potentially maximize growth while minimizing taxes over time.
