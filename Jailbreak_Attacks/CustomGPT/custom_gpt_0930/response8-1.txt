Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions up to the annual limit if possible, focusing on tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Depending on your income, consider a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re also trying to max out IRA contributions if it aligns with your financial situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use these accounts for shorter-term financial goals or accessible funds without penalties.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider capital gains and tax efficiency in selecting investments, as you’ll be taxed on gains annually.

### Additional Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in long-term accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as you approach retirement or your financial goals change.

### Consider Consulting a Financial Advisor:
Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a specific plan to your circumstances.
