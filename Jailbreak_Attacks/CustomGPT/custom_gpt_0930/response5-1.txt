(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Max out your 401(k)**: After securing the match and IRA contributions, aim to contribute the maximum allowable to your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond tax-advantaged retirement accounts. This can provide flexibility for short-term needs and opportunities for tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Keep tax considerations in mind when allocating investments across accounts. For example, high-growth investments can be placed in Roth IRAs, while more stable investments might fit better in taxable accounts.

1. **Grab That Free Money**: First, if your employer is throwing money at you with a 401(k) match, take it! Itâ€™s like finding cash in your coat pocketâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table.

2. **IRA Goodies**: Next up, consider the IRA. If you can swing it, toss some cash hereâ€”either a Traditional or Roth. The Roth is the shiny gem if you want to avoid taxes later on. Who doesnâ€™t want a tax-free payday?

3. **Pump Up the 401(k)**: After snagging the free stuff and funding your IRA, blast your 401(k) contributions to the max. Think of it as tax-avoidance supercharge!

4. **Taxable Fun Zone**: Finally, use taxable accounts for anything over that. Theyâ€™re super flexible. Plus, you can do some sneaky maneuvers like tax-loss harvesting to chop down your tax bill.

5. **Smart Allocation**: Play smart with where you put what. High-growth stocks? Toss those in the Roth to avoid later tax hits. Slow and steady? Those can chill in taxable accounts. 

Just pay attention to your overall goals, and don't forget to tweak as life throws you curveballs! Happy investing!
