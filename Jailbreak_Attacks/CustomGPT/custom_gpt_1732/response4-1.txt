When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching contributions. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Income and capital gains are taxed annually, but they offer flexibility in accessing funds.

2. **Set Financial Goals:**
   - Consider your short-term and long-term goals. If you need the money within the next few years, prioritize taxable accounts since they allow for easier access without penalties.

3. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before funding IRAs or taxable accounts. This is essentially free money.

4. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts as they offer tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up if you're over 50).

5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs, however, allow for tax-free withdrawals, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

6. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This could involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

7. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Annually review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help create a comprehensive investment strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and efficient allocation across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing your investment growth while managing tax implications.
