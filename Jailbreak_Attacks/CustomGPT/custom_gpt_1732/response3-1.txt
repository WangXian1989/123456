Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before contributing heavily to retirement accounts, ensure that any high-interest debt (like credit cards) is managed, as the interest on such debt can outpace investment returns.

3. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Pre-tax growth means you won't pay taxes on your earnings until withdrawal during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), though eligibility for tax-deductible contributions may depend on your income and whether you have a retirement plan at work.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on earnings. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to optimize tax efficiency.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across your accounts to mitigate risk. This means spreading your investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and how comfortable you are with risk should dictate your asset allocation. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks with a higher percentage in stocks, while those closer to retirement might want to reduce risk and shift towards more stable investments like bonds.

6. **Annual Contributions and Adjustments**: Set a budget for how much you want to contribute annually to each account. Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about how to allocate your funds optimally, consider consulting with a certified financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your retirement goals and financial circumstances.
