(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, here's a framework to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
2. **IRA**: Depending on your income and tax filing status, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to the 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is useful for liquidity and flexibility, though you'll incur capital gains taxes on any profits.

Consider your long-term financial strategy, and consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

1. **Max Your 401(k)**: Hit that employer match like you're diving into a hot tubâ€”because why miss out on free cash? Go for the max contribution if you can, and enjoy the tax benefits now. 
   
2. **IRA Party**: Depending on your vibeâ€”Traditional or Rothâ€”get your money into an IRA. If you want tax breaks now, go Traditional. If youâ€™re all about that tax-free retirement life (who isnâ€™t?), then Roth it up! 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is your playground for flexibility. Once you're maxed out on your tax-advantaged options, throw some dough into taxable accounts. Youâ€™ll pay taxes on gains, but it gives you access to your cash whenever. Just keep an eye on your capital gains tax like a hawk.

This combo keeps your money working hard for you. And yeah, donâ€™t forget to check in with a financial guru if you're feeling lost in the sauce!
