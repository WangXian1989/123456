When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be considered, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and overall investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match on 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After securing the employer match and contributing to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) if you have more available funds.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These accounts provide tax breaks upfront, meaning you don’t pay taxes on contributions until you withdraw in retirement. They are ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for investments you may need access to before retirement or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting. Focus on low-turnover investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Establish an Asset Allocation:**
   - Choose asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.). Diversify across your accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive the employer match, then up to the limit if possible.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to either a Roth or traditional IRA based on eligibility and tax situation.
- **Taxable Account:** Use any remaining funds for a taxable brokerage account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

This approach can help you maximize your investment potential while managing tax liabilities.
