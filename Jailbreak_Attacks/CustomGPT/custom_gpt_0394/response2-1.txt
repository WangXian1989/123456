Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Advantage Accounts**
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, a **Traditional IRA** may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a **Roth IRA** might be better.

### 4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**
   - After funding tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional investments in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across your accounts. Consider utilizing tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on your changing financial situation or goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your salary (until match met)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500/year for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

### Conclusion
Tailor this approach to your specific situation, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
