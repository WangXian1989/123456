To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out contributions to these accounts, as they offer tax benefits. For 2024, the maximum 401(k) contribution is $23,000, and IRAs allow up to $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50+).
   - **Roth vs Traditional**: Decide whether a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) is better based on your current and future tax situation.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient, such as stocks that you hold long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - **401(k)/IRA**: Invest in higher-growth assets like stocks, as the tax advantages amplify growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the distribution based on how soon youâ€™ll need the money and your comfort with risk.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations annually and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
