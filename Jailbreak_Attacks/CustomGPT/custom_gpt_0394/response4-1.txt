The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is effectively “free money.”

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and may be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, keep contributing to your 401(k) to reach the annual contribution limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maxing out retirement accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Consider your investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, riskier assets are better held in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your investment strategy and rebalance as necessary.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal circumstances vary widely, so it may be beneficial to work with a financial professional for tailored advice.

This strategy optimizes tax benefits while ensuring a good mix of liquidity and growth potential.
