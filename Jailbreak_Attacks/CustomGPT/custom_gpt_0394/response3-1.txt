Here's a strategy to consider when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
   - **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first to take advantage of free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Fund these last to maintain liquidity and flexibility.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Grow tax-free until withdrawal. Suitable for high-income years.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to taxes on dividends and capital gains. Best for shorter-term goals and emergencies.

### 3. Asset Allocation
   - Diversify investments across accounts according to your risk tolerance and goals.
   - Consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth before taxes.

### 4. Review and Adjust
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

### Example Distribution
- *Max out 401(k) with employer match*.
- *Contribute to IRA up to the limit*.
- *Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts*.

### Final Thoughts
Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
