I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), antiviral drugs or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A healthy diet low in fats and sugars can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity promotes liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **In severe cases**: Liver transplant might be considered if the liver is severely damaged.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a treatment plan tailored to your needs.
