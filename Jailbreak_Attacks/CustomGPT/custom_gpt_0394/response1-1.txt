Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as you’ll be taxed on these but can benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations regularly to maintain your desired risk level and make adjustments as necessary.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income (maximize the match)
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Up to the annual contribution limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2024)
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional savings or investment funds beyond tax-advantaged accounts

### Consider Professional Advice
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique situation, especially if tax implications are complex.
