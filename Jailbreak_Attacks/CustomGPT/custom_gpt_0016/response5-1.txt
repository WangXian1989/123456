(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Generally, it's beneficial to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs over taxable accounts since they offer tax-deferred growth.
3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments in each type of account based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and higher-growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your anticipated tax bracket in retirement when planning how to withdraw funds from each account. Taxed accounts can give you more expensive withdrawals where IRAs and 401(k)s may have penalties for early withdrawal.

1. **Max That Match**: First things first, if your employer's throwing in some match on your 401(k), you better be snatching that upâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table!
2. **Tax Advantage, Baby**: Next up, think tax efficiency. Load up your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) as much as you can before touching those taxable accounts. Why pay taxes now when you can push it to later? Plus, you can snag that sweet compounding action while Uncle Sam waits!
3. **Mix It Up**: Keep your investment mix spicy! Load your tax-inefficient assets like bonds in your tax-advantaged accounts and save your high-growth stocks for the taxable ones where capital gains can hit harder.
4. **Plan for the Future**: When it comes to withdrawing, think about your tax bracket like itâ€™s the final boss level. Make sure youâ€™re strategizing your pulls to minimize those tax hits when youâ€™re ready to cash in on retirement!
