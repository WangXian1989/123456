When distributing your money among different types of accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions up to the IRS limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA:** Choose between a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) to tax-advantaged accounts and hold investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - Consider capital gains tax implications and loss harvesting strategies to enhance your after-tax returns.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, managing overall asset allocation consistent with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Conduct periodic reviews of your allocation to align with changing financial goals, market conditions, or life circumstances.

By adhering to these principles, you can optimize your investment strategy across these various financial vehicles for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
