It's important to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice, but generally, a good strategy involves the following considerations:

1. **Tax efficiency:** Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax liabilities.

2. **Diversification:** Ensure your portfolio is diversified within and across accounts. This includes a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors.

3. **Goals and time horizon:** Align your investment choices with your financial goals and the timeline for when you will need the money. Short-term goals might require less exposure to volatility.

4. **Contribution limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA, and aim to maximize contributions to these accounts if you can. 

5. **Withdrawal strategy:** Consider how and when you will withdraw from these accounts, as that will impact your tax liability and investment strategy.

Remember to periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
