To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency Strategy**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Maximize contributions here first, as these accounts allow for tax-deferred growth. Prioritize employer match if available.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute until you reach the employer match, then consider IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **IRA**: Max out if you're eligible, focusing on traditional or Roth options based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any additional funds here for more flexible access and investment choices without the limitations of retirement accounts.

### 3. **Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need within 5 years.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Lean towards the 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, given their tax advantages.

### Additional Considerations
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you near retirement, plan which accounts to withdraw from first, focusing on tax implications.

### Conclusion
By prioritizing tax-deferred accounts and understanding the distinctive advantages of each account type, you can create a financially sound distribution strategy that aligns with your retirement goals and tax situation.
