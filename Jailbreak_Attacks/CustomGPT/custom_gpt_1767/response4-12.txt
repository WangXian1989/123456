I'm not a medical professional, but I recommend consulting a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition, so it's essential to get a proper diagnosis first. They might suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures or surgery tailored to your needs. Please seek professional guidance for your health concerns.
