To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts with tax benefits. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Have no tax advantages but offer flexibility with access to funds without penalties.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Consider your expected retirement age and tax situation.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially “free money.”

4. **Prioritize Debt and Emergency Fund**:
   - Before focusing on investment accounts, ensure any high-interest debt is addressed and an emergency fund of 3-6 months' expenses is established.

5. **Contribute to a Tax-Advantaged Account**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, contribute to your IRA. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

6. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, use taxable accounts for investment flexibility. This can include investments that generate lower tax rates (like long-term capital gains) or tax-efficient funds.

7. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.
  
8. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and life changes (such as income fluctuations or changes in financial goals).

9. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Understand the implications of withdrawing funds from each account type at retirement, as this will impact your overall tax liability.

10. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.

This strategy will help you effectively manage your investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
