Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your contributions to take advantage of any employer match. This account offers tax-deferred growth, which is beneficial for long-term savings.

2. **IRA/Roth IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might be more advantageous for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out contributions to retirement accounts. Keep in mind capital gains tax and how you’ll handle withdrawals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match first (e.g., 5-10% of income).
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute the annual maximum if possible (e.g., $6,500 in 2023, with an extra $1,000 if you're over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate any additional savings here after maximizing retirement contributions.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Debt**: Pay off high-interest debt before heavily investing.
- **Investment Strategy**: Keep an eye on asset allocation to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation for personalized advice.
