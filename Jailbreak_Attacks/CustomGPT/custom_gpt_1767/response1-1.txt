To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) if you can contribute for the year.

3. **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. The limits can vary annually, so stay updated where applicable.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Keep a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Stocks in tax-advantaged accounts can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, while bonds (which are typically taxed at higher rates) may be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement, pulling first from taxable accounts to allow for continued tax-advantaged growth in your retirement accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and investment strategy as your situation and the markets evolve.

Always consider your individual financial situation, and a financial advisor can help tailor these guidelines to your specific needs.
