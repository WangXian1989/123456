Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guide:

### 1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available—it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions:** These can reduce your taxable income now, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older). Prioritize maxing out contributions if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### General Strategy:
1. **Allocate Wisely:** 
   - Start with maximizing employer contributions in your 401(k).
   - Next, contribute to an IRA, choosing between traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
   - Finally, use taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on investments that yield lower capital gains.

2. **Regular Review:**
   - Reassess your distribution based on changes in income, investment performance, and tax laws annually.

### Conclusion:
Tailoring your investment strategy to your personal circumstances can significantly impact your financial future. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
