Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). These accounts offer tax benefits, and Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Contribute to the 401(k)**
   - If you've maxed out your IRA and still have room in your budget, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you have exhausted the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. In these accounts, you can take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates, which are usually lower than ordinary income tax rates.

### 5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts. Consider holding more high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable events, while reserving lower-growth investments for taxable accounts where you'll be paying capital gains tax on the earnings.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Regularly review your allocations and contributions based on changes in your income, tax situation, and financial goals.

### Final Thoughts
Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your personal circumstances and ensure you're making the most tax-efficient decisions.
