Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors: your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general principles to guide your decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). Both IRA types offer tax advantages, but choose based on your projected tax rate during retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Withdrawals and Taxes on Account Type**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here don't have tax advantages, but you can control when to realize gains or losses. Long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider your short-term vs. long-term needs. If you may need the funds before retirement, a taxable account could be more appropriate as it doesnâ€™t have withdrawal penalties.

6. **Diversification and Investment Choices**: Make sure you diversify your investments across accounts. Each account type may offer different investment options, so ensure your overall portfolio remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation. 

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Finally, consider seeking guidance from a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is one that aligns with your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
