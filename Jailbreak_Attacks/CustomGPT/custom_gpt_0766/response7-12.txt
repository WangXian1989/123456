I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health. It's crucial that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Some common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A healthy diet low in fat and sugar can help. Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver function and overall health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed. For example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms in liver cirrhosis.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly improve liver health, especially for fatty liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular appointments with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people consider certain supplements, like milk thistle or vitamin E, but you should discuss these with your doctor.

Again, please speak to a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
