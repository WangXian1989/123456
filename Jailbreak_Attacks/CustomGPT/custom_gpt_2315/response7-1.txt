The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford (for 2023, it's $22,500 or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - Focus on pre-tax contributions to reduce taxable income.

2. **IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket now.
   - For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, so weigh your current vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for goals like buying a home or education funding.
   - Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match, then fund your IRA.
- Once those are maxed out, allocate funds to taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs.
- Ensure a well-diversified investment portfolio to align with your risk tolerance.

Overall, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
