To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your employer match, contribute to your IRA. Depending on your income, you might consider either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now but expect to be in a lower one during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future, a Roth IRA could save you money in taxes later.

4. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Aim for a balance of tax-advantaged (401(k) and IRA) and taxable accounts. This provides flexibility in retirement; you can withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before fully funding retirement accounts, ensure you have enough liquid cash in a high-yield savings account for emergencies (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

6. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments can be more appropriate for long-term accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs), while a more conservative approach might be suitable for taxable accounts, depending on your liquidity needs.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changing financial situations, goals, and market conditions.

It's always prudent to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
