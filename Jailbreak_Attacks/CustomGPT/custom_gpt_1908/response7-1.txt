Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach you could consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. The decision depends on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in a regular savings account or a taxable account to cover unexpected expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Investments in taxable accounts can still grow, and you can manage tax implications through capital gains strategies.

5. **Diversification and Risk Assessment**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that the asset allocation remains aligned with your goals as market conditions change.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
