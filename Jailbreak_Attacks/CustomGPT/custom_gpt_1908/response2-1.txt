When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) as well, considering your eligibility for deductible contributions and the tax implications of each.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are age 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you are age 50 or older).

3. **Utilize the Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) and IRAs provide immediate tax benefits through pre-tax contributions. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. This may involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement age. They can also be beneficial for holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which can minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw from each account type. It's often advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications, contribution limits, and investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By carefully considering these factors and regularly reviewing your investment allocations, you can optimize your money distribution amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
