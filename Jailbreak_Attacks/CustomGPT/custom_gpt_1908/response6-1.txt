The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if possible, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions upfront, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but may be subject to capital gains tax when selling investments.

3. **Diversified Investments:**
   - Ensure that your investment allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is diversified across all accounts. This can help mitigate risk and potentially enhance returns over time.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Holding onto investments for over a year may qualify for lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts based on performance and changes in your risk tolerance.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
