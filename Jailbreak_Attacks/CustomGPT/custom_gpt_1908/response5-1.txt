(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, income, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Generally, you can consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing your IRA contributions. Both accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**: Since withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, a higher allocation to these accounts can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. In contrast, taxable accounts may be better for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**: Each account can hold different types of investments. You may want to place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while more stable investments can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Regularly Review Your Allocation**: Adjust your contributions and investment allocations over time based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer matches 401(k) contributions, max that out firstâ€”itâ€™s free money! Get your slice of that pie before it disappears. 

2. **IRA Action**: After you've hit up the 401(k) match, throw money into an IRA. If you're under 50, you can sock away up to 6k a year (more if you're over 50). Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for that sweet tax-free retirement cash.

3. **Tackle Taxes**: Be smart with your taxable accounts. These are great for money you might need before retirement and can hold assets that donâ€™t get hit with monstrous taxes. Think about keeping your stocks or riskier investments there since theyâ€™re taxed at a better capital gains rate when sold.

4. **Balance & Adjust**: Donâ€™t just set and forget. Keep an eye on your investments and be ready to shuffle things around based on how youâ€™re feeling about taxes and your goals.

In short, get your employerâ€™s 401(k) match, then hit the IRA, and keep some balance in taxable accounts for flexibility. And if youâ€™re feeling lost, hit up a financial advisor who can carve out a plan just for you.
