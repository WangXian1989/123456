The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional retirement savings. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement. Roth IRAs and taxable accounts are different; Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals, and taxable accounts may have capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. This can include stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Consider the Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy based on your expected tax bracket during retirement. You may want to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts in lower-income years to minimize taxes.

6. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're younger and have a long time until retirement, you may lean more heavily into stocks within your accounts. As you approach retirement, you might want to shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
