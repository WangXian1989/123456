The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching Contributions (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers matching contributions for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides a strong return on your investment.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings from investments are taxed annually, but these accounts offer flexibility with withdrawals.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) for investments that have high growth potential (like stocks) because you want to minimize tax on those gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce income (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) since those could be taxed at a lower capital gains rate when sold.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Assess your short-term vs. long-term needs. If you need the money within a few years, keep it in a more liquid and stable form in a taxable account.
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Periodically**
   - Monitor your investments regularly and adjust your contributions as necessary based on performance, changing goals, and life circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Monthly Contribution Strategy:**
  - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
  - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA.
  - **Taxable Account:** Any extra funds can be invested in a taxable account.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the distribution should align with your financial goals and situation. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances.
