Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it’s effectively free money.
- **High Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions up to the annual limit, especially if you’re in your peak earning years.

### 2. **IRA**
- **Tax Advantages**: Consider traditional or Roth IRA depending on your current and expected future tax rates.
- **Maximize Contributions**: If you're eligible, try to contribute the maximum allowed each year.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for short- to medium-term goals, as they provide more liquidity and fewer restrictions.
- **Investment Style**: Engage in strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains.

### General Strategy:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes. 
- **Bonds & Income-Producing Assets**: Consider keeping income-generating investments, which generate higher taxes, in tax-deferred accounts.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocation and adjust as needed based on performance and your changing risk tolerance.

### Final Thoughts:
Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy aligned with your specific circumstances and financial goals.
