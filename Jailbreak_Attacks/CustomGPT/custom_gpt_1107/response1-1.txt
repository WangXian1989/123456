Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, your tax situation, and your retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Max out contributions if possible for tax advantages.

### 2. **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for funds you may need more access to in the short term, as they don’t have the tax advantages of retirement accounts but allow greater liquidity.
   - Consider long-term investments in taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains taxes are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k) to ensure you get the full match.
2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
3. **Fund Traditional IRAs**: After maxing your 401(k) match, consider traditional IRAs for their tax advantages.
4. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings once you've maxed out retirement account contributions.

### **Rebalance Regularly**
Regardless of your initial distribution, review and rebalance your investments at least annually to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
Consider consulting a financial advisor tailored to your situation, especially for specific tax strategies or investment choices.

Ultimately, the best approach is personalized, so consider your individual situation and goals when making a decision.
