To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, max out your IRA contributions for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible. Withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold.

### 3. **Balance Between Growth and Risk**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on higher-growth investments here, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more conservative investments to manage tax implications on realized gains.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Keep some liquid savings in a taxable account to cover emergencies or short-term expenses without penalties.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate funds in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 40%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30%

### Regular Review
- Periodically assess your investments and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation.
