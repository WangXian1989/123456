Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Benefits from employer matching and tax deferrals. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax benefits; Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Provides flexibility for short-term goals without penalties for early withdrawals.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Prioritize taxable accounts for easy access.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

### 3. **Contribution Strategies**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable savings for flexibility and liquidity.

### 4. **Diversification and Investment Choices**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Prioritize accounts based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - Be conscious of capital gains in taxable accounts and plan withdrawals to minimize tax impact.

### Summary
- **Short-Term:** Use taxable accounts.
- **Long-Term:** Max out your 401(k) and IRA.
- **Diversify** investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
