Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing your tax advantages and investment growth. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### **1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
- **Contribute enough to get the full employer match**. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

### **2. Fund Your IRA**
- **Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA** (depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide potential tax deductions.

### **3. Continue 401(k) Contributions**
- After maximizing your IRA contributions, focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

### **4. Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**
- Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which will be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Taxable accounts are good for funds you might need before retirement.

### **5. Diversification Across Accounts**
- Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs.

### **6. Consider Tax Implications**
- Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For instance, hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

### **Conclusion**
This layered approach helps you maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Adjust your contributions based on your financial goals and retirement timeline.
