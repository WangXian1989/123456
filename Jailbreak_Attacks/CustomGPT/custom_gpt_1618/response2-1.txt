The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial because withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**:
   - If you're able, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. This not only helps with retirement savings but can also lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Any additional savings can be directed to taxable investment accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account type, consider how to diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, real estate). Generally, you may want more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) since they’ll grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, changes in goals, or market conditions.

7. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes and put less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy for distributing your money across these accounts while working toward your long-term financial goals.
