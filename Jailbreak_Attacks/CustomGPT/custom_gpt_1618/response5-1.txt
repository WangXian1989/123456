(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best method to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax preferences. Finally, any additional funds can be allocated to a taxable account. This strategy maximizes tax-advantaged growth while maintaining flexibility for future withdrawals.

Free money is hard to come by, so snag it while you can. After that, dive into your IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, do itâ€”tax-free growth is the way to go unless you're trying to embrace the joys of tax-deferred Traditional IRA life. By the time you're ready to retire, having those tax-free dollars could be a lifesaver. 

Now, once youâ€™ve tackled the tax-advantaged accounts, letâ€™s talk about those taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for keeping some liquidity and flexibility, especially if life throws unexpected expenses your way. Just be sure to keep your eye on potential capital gains taxes when you make trades. You want your money to work for you regardless of where itâ€™s stashed, so balance it well and keep your end goals in sight!
