I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding your liver problem. Common treatment options may vary based on the specific liver condition you have, but they could include lifestyle changes like diet modifications, medication to manage symptoms or complications, and, in more severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation. Always seek professional medical guidance for your health concerns.
