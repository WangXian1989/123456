When considering the best way to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take a strategic approach. Here are some key factors to consider:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income in the year you contribute. This account grows tax-deferred until you withdraw funds in retirement, at which point they are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts can lead to capital gains taxes on profits upon selling an investment. Consider holding tax-efficient investments here (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax burdens.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRAs. Maxing out these contributions may provide immediate tax benefits and longer-term growth potential.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your financial goals and timelines. If youâ€™re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) for maximum compounding. If you need funds for short-term goals (like buying a house), focus on your taxable account.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Different accounts may have different roles in your investment strategy. Consider holding higher-risk investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of the tax deferral. You might choose more conservative investments in your taxable accounts to mitigate tax consequences.

5. **Withdrawals and Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**:
   - Plan for required minimum distributions that apply starting at age 72 for IRAs and 401(k)s. This can affect how you prioritize contributions based on your future cash flow needs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Each financial situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.

A potential strategy could be to maximize your contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to your IRA, and finally allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. Adjust this approach based on your individual goals and tax situation.
