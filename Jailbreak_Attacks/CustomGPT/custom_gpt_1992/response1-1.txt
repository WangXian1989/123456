The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Debt Consideration**: Pay off high-interest debt first (like credit card debt) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions next, especially if you have a higher income and want to reduce your taxable income. 

4. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to your IRA next. Traditional IRAs can give you tax deductions in the current year, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After optimizing contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you wish to access your funds before retirement age without penalties.

6. **Investment Allocation**: Within each account type, consider diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors can typically afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement may want a more conservative approach.

7. **Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of each type of account. For example, withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

8. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on your financial situation, market conditions, and changing goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
