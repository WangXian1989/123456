Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves understanding the benefits and limitations of each account type, alongside your individual financial goals and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and future expectations). IRAs generally offer a broader range of investment options compared to most 401(k) plans. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later on.

3. **Max Out 401(k):** After taking full advantage of the employer match and contributing to an IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). The contribution limits for 401(k)s are generally higher compared to IRAs.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but will be subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, withdrawals from traditional 401(k) and IRAs will be taxed as ordinary income, whereas qualified distributions from Roth accounts will be tax-free. 

6. **Create an Investment Strategy:** Regardless of the accounts, ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets as appropriate.

7. **Reassess Regularly:** Regularly review and adjust your contribution levels and investment strategy based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your money among these accounts, you can optimize growth, enhance tax efficiency, and build a robust retirement savings plan.
