The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of it as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out your contributions if possible, given the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which may reduce your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth. Choose based on your expected future tax rate versus your current rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and income restrictions for Roth IRAs.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs for investments that may benefit from tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Taxable accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. 
   - **Long-Term Strategy**: Consider holding assets for longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### Strategy:
- **Hybrid Approach**: Diversify your contributions among all three accounts based on your short-term vs. long-term needs.
- **Rebalance Annually**: Adjust your investments periodically based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax implications and investment choices, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your circumstances.

Ultimately, your distribution strategy should be aligned with your overall financial plan and retirement goals.
