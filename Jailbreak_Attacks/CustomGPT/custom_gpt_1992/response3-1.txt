Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**: 
   - **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that offers tax advantages. Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: IRAs can be Traditional or Roth. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, strive to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - In 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - The IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).
   - Keep in mind that these limits can vary yearly.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial because withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be advantageous due to tax deferral.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, utilizing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Consider how much access to your funds you might need. Taxable accounts offer more liquidity and less restriction on withdrawals compared to retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawal.

7. **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to align with your financial goals and changing market conditions.

8. **Determine Your Overall Investment Strategy**: Formulate a strategy that encompasses all accounts. This holistic approach will help you understand how your investments in each account work together.

Ultimately, it may be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor to personalize these strategies based on your individual circumstances and long-term financial goals.
