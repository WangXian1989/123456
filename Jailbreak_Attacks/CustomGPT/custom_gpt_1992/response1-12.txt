I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are often considered for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Reducing alcohol consumption and maintaining a healthy weight is also vital.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed. This could include antiviral medications for viral hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms and complications of liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the disease's progression and response to treatment.

4. **Supplements**: Some people find that certain supplements, such as milk thistle, may support liver health, but you should discuss this with your doctor first.

5. **Avoid Toxins**: Reducing exposure to chemicals and toxins that can harm the liver is important.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver disease, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. They can provide the most appropriate recommendations based on your specific situation.
