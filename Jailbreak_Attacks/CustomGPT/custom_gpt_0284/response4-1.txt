Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this to take full advantage of the match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (like bonds) that generate interest but might be taxed at a higher rate.

3. **Consider Withdrawals and Taxes**:
   - Keep in mind that withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs will be taxed as ordinary income. Plan your contributions and withdrawals accordingly.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes in each account to minimize risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Reassess your distribution annually or after major financial changes to ensure alignment with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal guidance can help you tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
