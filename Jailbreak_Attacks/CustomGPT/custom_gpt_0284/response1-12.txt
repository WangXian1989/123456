I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific condition.

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid saturated fats and high sugars.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management:** Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce liver stress.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Avoid Alcohol:**
   - If alcohol is contributing to liver problems, abstaining from it is crucial.

4. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Liver Transplant:**
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.
