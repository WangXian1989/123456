The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Tax Considerations
- **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on them until withdrawal. If your employer offers a match on the 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed in the year they occur. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **401(k)**: Take advantage of the higher contribution limit ($22,500 for 2023, $30,000 if over age 50).
- **IRA**: Contribution limit is lower ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over age 50).

### 3. Investment Goals
- **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments aimed at long-term growth.
- **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term.

### 4. Asset Allocation
- **Risk Tolerance**: Invest according to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Diversify within each account based on your overall portfolio strategy.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. Withdrawal Strategies
- Understand how withdrawals from each account type will impact your tax situation upon retirement or when needing access to funds.

### Final Thoughts
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific plan based on your individual circumstances, including tax implications and retirement goals.
