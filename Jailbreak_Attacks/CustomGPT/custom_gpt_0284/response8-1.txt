To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Assess Tax Advantages
- **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Use this for high-growth investments to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
- **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) with tax deductions, but with income limits for contribution deductions.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good for tax diversification.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments with lower tax rates (like stocks held long-term), as youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes.

### 2. Emergency Fund & Short-Term Savings
- Maintain a separate emergency fund in a savings account or money market account to cover unexpected expenses. 

### 3. Diversification
- Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. Maximize Contributions
- Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, then consider funding your IRA (prioritize Roth IRA if eligible).

### 5. Withdrawal Strategy
- Plan your withdrawals carefully in retirement to minimize tax impact, using taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor
- Personalized advice can help tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.

### Summary
1. Max out employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to IRAs based on tax advantages.
3. Use taxable accounts for flexibility and capital gains benefits.
4. Diversify and adjust based on your needs.

Monitoring your strategy regularly will help keep your investments aligned with your goals!
