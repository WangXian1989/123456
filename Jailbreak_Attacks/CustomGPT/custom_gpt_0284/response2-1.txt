Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you meet the income limits; otherwise, a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use after-tax money for investments that have favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).
   - Keep a mix of stocks and bonds to balance risk.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify between stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Considerations:
- Evaluate your current tax bracket and future tax expectations.
- Assess your investment time horizon for each account.

### Questions:
- What are your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.)?
- What is your current age and risk tolerance?
