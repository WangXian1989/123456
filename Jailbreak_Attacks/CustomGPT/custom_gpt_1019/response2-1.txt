Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available), then consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Both accounts allow for tax-deferred growth.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money. Aim to increase contributions gradually as your salary increases.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now. Your choice may depend on your current and expected retirement tax rates.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility in terms of accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account but consider holding more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It can also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
