To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first as itâ€™s free money. Aim to contribute the maximum limit ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

2. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for:
   - Funds you might need for short-term goals.
   - Investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) since they benefit from tax deferral.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like bonds or tax-managed funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months' worth of expenses before heavy investing.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a plan to your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

Consider your retirement timeline and tax implications when making these decisions. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes.
