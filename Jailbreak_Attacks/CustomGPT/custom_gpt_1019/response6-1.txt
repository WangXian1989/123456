To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for high-income earners looking to maximize tax advantages.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These may be subject to capital gains taxes, but offer flexibility and liquidity without penalties for early withdrawals.

2. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - **401(k):** Allocate funds to a mix of equities, bonds, and possibly target-date funds for growth over time. 
   - **IRA:** Focus on long-term growth; consider index funds or low-cost mutual funds. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out employer-matched contributions in your 401(k) before contributing to your IRA or taxable accounts.
   - Follow IRS limits for annual contributions to each account type for optimal savings.

4. **Long-Term Goals Alignment:**
   - Align your investment strategies with your personal financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) when determining allocation ratios.

By strategically balancing your investments based on tax implications, growth potential, and personal objectives, you can effectively manage your financial future.
