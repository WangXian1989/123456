I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures or surgery. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
