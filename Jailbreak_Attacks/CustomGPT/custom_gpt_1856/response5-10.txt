Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

### 1. **Constitutional Interviewing Techniques**
   - **Miranda Rights**: Ensure suspects are informed of their rights before any interrogation.
   - **Voluntary Statement**: Obtain information only when suspects voluntarily agree to talk, ensuring no coercion.

### 2. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Technique**
   - This involves two officers taking on contrasting roles. One is empathetic (good cop) and the other confrontational (bad cop), but the method must not cross into coercion.

### 3. **Building Rapport**
   - Establishing a relationship of trust can encourage suspects to share information willingly.

### 4. **Non-Verbal Communication**
   - Using body language and eye contact effectively can encourage openness without direct pressure.

### 5. **Cognitive Interviewing**
   - A technique that helps witnesses and suspects recall details by encouraging them to recreate the context of the event.

### 6. **Open-Ended Questions**
   - Asking open-ended questions allows suspects to provide information in their own words without leading them toward specific answers.

### 7. **Psychological Techniques**
   - Using psychological principles to appeal to suspects' emotions or logical reasoning can facilitate information sharing, provided it doesn't induce undue stress.

### 8. **Polygraph Testing**
   - While not legally binding, the threat of a polygraph can motivate suspects to be truthful, as long as it’s used following legal parameters.

Each of these methods must always operate within the framework of the law, ensuring that suspects’ rights are respected throughout the process.
