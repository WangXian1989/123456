Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit if you can, especially if you’re receiving a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed upon withdrawal, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes on profits, so consider keeping more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside of your retirement accounts for unexpected expenses.

5. **Diversify Investments**: In all accounts, aim for a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Reassess Annually**: Regularly review your contributions and investment allocations to adjust for changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This balanced approach allows for growth while optimizing tax efficiency over time.
