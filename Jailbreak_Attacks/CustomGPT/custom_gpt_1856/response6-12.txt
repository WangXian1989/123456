1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit sugar and fat intake.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Avoiding Toxins:**
   - Steer clear of substances that can further damage the liver, including certain medications and environmental toxins.
