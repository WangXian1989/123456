Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if you can’t take full advantage of the employer match.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

3. **Build a Taxable Account**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This is useful for funds you might need before retirement age since it offers more flexibility and fewer penalties for withdrawal.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments, plus taxes on dividends and interest.

5. **Review Your Investment Strategy**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your time horizon. Longer timelines can typically handle more risk (like stocks) compared to shorter ones (like bonds).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make sure to review and adjust your portfolio periodically to align with your changing financial situation and goals.

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more heavily towards stocks in their retirement accounts, while older investors may prefer bonds to preserve capital.
- **Withdrawal Needs**: If you anticipate needing money before retirement age, ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts.

It's often advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances.
