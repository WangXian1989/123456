Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA/ROTH IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. If your income allows, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: Once you’re maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They provide more liquidity, allowing access without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. This often includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be aware of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

By following this structured approach, you can create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your financial objectives and maximizes your resources effectively. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
