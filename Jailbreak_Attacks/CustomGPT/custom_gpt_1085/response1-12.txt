I’m not a doctor, but the best treatment for liver issues often depends on the specific condition. Common options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: To manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (like hepatitis).
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver health.
4. **Other Therapies**: Depending on the condition, options like antiviral medications or liver transplant might be considered.

It’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice!
