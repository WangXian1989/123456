I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you consider talking to a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments for liver problems often include:

1. **Dietary Changes**: A healthy diet low in fat and sugar can support liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
3. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Reducing alcohol intake and maintaining a healthy weight are crucial.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups can help track liver function.
5. **Advanced Treatments**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a tailored plan!
