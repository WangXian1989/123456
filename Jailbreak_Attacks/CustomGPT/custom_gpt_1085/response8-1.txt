To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Use IRAs for Tax Benefits**:
   - If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. 
   - If you prefer immediate tax benefits, contribute to a Traditional IRA.

3. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Tax Impact**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to avoid capital gains taxes.
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like bonds or certain ETFs) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Across Account Types**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts for balanced risk and return.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: If you're nearing retirement, plan for how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts, considering tax implications.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your individual situation.
