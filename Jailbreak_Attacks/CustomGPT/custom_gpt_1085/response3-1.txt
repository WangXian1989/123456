Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re under age 50, aim to contribute the maximum. If you're over 50, consider making catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional savings or short-term goals, keeping in mind the tax implications of investment gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on higher-growth investments (like stocks) since withdrawals may be taxed at your income rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax liability.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and investment strategies based on changes in income, tax laws, and life circumstances.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
