I’m not a doctor, but I can share some general treatment options for liver problems. It’s important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoid alcohol and illicit drugs.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), doctors might prescribe antiviral medications or liver-supportive supplements.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and other related markers.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Control diabetes, cholesterol, and blood pressure, as these can affect liver health.

5. **Consideration for Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

Make sure to consult with your healthcare provider for the most appropriate course of action tailored to your specific situation.
