The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. It often has higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA if you qualify. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Invest more in **taxable accounts** for short-term needs to avoid early withdrawal penalties from retirement accounts.
   - Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Adjust for Time Horizon**
   - If retirement is many years away, focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you approach your target date, gradually reduce risk exposure by shifting to more conservative investments.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically check your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on performance and changing life circumstances.

### Example Distribution Approach
- **401(k):** 15% of your income to reach the maximum allowable contribution and secure any employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Account:** After maxing out retirement accounts, invest any additional savings in a taxable account using strategies to minimize tax liabilities.

Adjust these percentages based on your specific situation and goals! Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations.
