I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. They can evaluate your specific condition and recommend treatments. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Eating a balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: Avoiding alcohol to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Blood Tests**: To assess liver function regularly.
   - **Imaging Studies**: Such as ultrasounds or CT scans to monitor liver condition.

4. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver is failing.

Make sure to discuss these options with your doctor for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
