I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatments might include:

1. **Dietary Changes:** A healthy diet, low in saturated fats and sugars, can help.
2. **Medications:** Certain medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition.
3. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Reducing alcohol intake and maintaining a healthy weight.
4. **Regular Monitoring:** Keeping track of liver function through regular check-ups.

Always follow your healthcare provider's guidance for personalized advice.
