To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, focus on fully funding your IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age since they don’t have withdrawal penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Evaluate your investment goals and risk tolerance to determine the mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Generally, higher growth investments are suited for longer-term accounts (like 401(k) and IRA), while more conservative investments could be placed in taxable accounts for ease of access.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains tax rates can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your portfolio and adjust contributions and allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals.
