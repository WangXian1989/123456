To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If there's a good match, max this out first. It's tax-deferred, meaning your contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax advantages. Alternatively, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments outside your retirement accounts. This can provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - **Equities**: Favor holding stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - **Bonds**: Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts since their interest is typically taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation annually or semi-annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

Make sure your distribution aligns with your long-term financial goals!
