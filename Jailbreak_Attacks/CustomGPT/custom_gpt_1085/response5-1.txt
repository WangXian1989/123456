Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plan**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free" money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is ideal for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may be subject to capital gains tax but offer flexibility for withdrawals. They are excellent for funds you may need before retirement or for specific goals like buying a house.

### Suggested Order of Contributions:

1. Max out your 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA.
3. Max out your 401(k) contributions.
4. Invest in taxable accounts.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust asset allocation based on your comfort level with risk.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can afford more risk.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your individual circumstances is also a good idea.
