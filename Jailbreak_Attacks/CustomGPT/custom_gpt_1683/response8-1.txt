To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" and provides a solid foundation.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). Depending on your income level and tax situation, a Roth IRA may provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can offer tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: If you still have additional funds to invest, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This not only provides tax-deferred growth but can also lower your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any surplus funds beyond retirement account limits can be invested in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawal and investment options, but keep in mind the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Tax-Efficient Investments**: In your taxable account, prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-exempt bonds to minimize tax liabilities. This strategy can enhance long-term returns.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust Allocations**: Periodically review your allocations based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. As you approach retirement, gradually adjust your investments to become more conservative.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual situation, ensuring alignment with your long-term financial goals.
