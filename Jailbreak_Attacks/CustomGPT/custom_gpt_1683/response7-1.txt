When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can lead to greater savings over time.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)), where distributions are tax-free. For those in lower current tax brackets, traditional accounts (like a traditional IRA or 401(k)) may be more advantageous.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Balance your investment approach based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Consider using tax-efficient investment strategies, such as placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and equities in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds from each account in retirement. Remember that traditional 401(k)s and IRAs will have RMDs starting at age 72, which can affect your tax strategy.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments across accounts to ensure they align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good idea for personalized advice that considers your unique financial situation.
