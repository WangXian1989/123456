Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are often tax-deductible, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax rate and expected retirement tax rate, decide how much to put into each.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free accounts (like Roth IRA) for tax diversification. This can provide flexibility in retirement.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some funds in a taxable account for immediate access in case of emergencies, as funds in retirement accounts can have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Long-Term Growth**: Consider your overall investment strategy. If you’re focused on long-term growth, a mix of stocks in all accounts can be beneficial, but ensure you adjust for risk and investment timelines.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Assess your portfolio at least annually to make sure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific situation.
