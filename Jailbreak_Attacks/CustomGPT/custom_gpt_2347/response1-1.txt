Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full amount. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Choose between traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using these for investments that generate capital gains (taxed at a lower rate) versus ordinary income.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust contributions based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your specific situation.
