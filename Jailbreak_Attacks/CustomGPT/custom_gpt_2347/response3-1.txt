When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax situation. 

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts before maximizing contributions.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider having more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative or income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Professional Advice**: Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your income, objectives, and risk tolerance. 

By balancing contributions across these accounts with an emphasis on tax efficiency, you can optimize your growth and retirement savings.
