Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be a good option if you expect higher income in the future.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), it offers tax-deductible contributions, which can help reduce taxable income.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) options to provide flexibility in retirement.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for goals within the next 5-10 years. These provide easier access without penalties.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings in a high-yield savings account or similar, separate from investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As investments grow and your financial situation changes, periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
