Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits:** If you can afford it, max out your contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you qualify for both, you might split contributions to balance benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Retirement Timeline:** Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might shift towards more conservative investments.
- **Investment Goals:** Align account allocations with your goals; prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, but don’t neglect taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Diversification:** Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Regular Review:
Regularly review and adjust allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or financial goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
