Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Utilize IRA Contributions**
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - Once your IRA contributions are maxed, redirect your funds back to your 401(k). Aim to increase your contributions to the annual limit if you can.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - After meeting your 401(k) and IRA limits, invest in a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for medium-term goals.

### 5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, while holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Depending on your situation, it may be helpful to work with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

### General Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these investments.
- **Debt:** Prioritize paying off high-interest debt.
- **Retirement Age:** Your timeline for retirement can impact how aggressively you want to invest.

### Conclusion
By strategically allocating your contributions based on the above factors, you can optimize your asset growth and tax efficiency while preparing for retirement. Always tailor this approach to your personal financial situation and goals.
