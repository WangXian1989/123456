(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, you should prioritize:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

It's also wise to diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk and reward.

1. **401(k)**: Go for the match firstâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Itâ€™s like getting a bonus just for showing up.
2. **IRA**: Max it out next, especially if youâ€™re into that sweet, sweet tax-free growth with a Roth IRA or going traditional for tax deferrals. You want to keep those tax benefits rolling!
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve milked the tax-advantaged options, hit up those taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and you can access your cash when life throws you curveballs!

Just make sure your asset allocation matches your vibeâ€”aggressive or chillâ€”because you want to ride the waves of the market without losing your lunch!
