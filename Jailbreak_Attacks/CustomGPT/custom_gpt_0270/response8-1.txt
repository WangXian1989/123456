Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (especially if they offer tax deductions) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**: For retirement accounts, focus on long-term growth through stocks or diversified funds. In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, to manage taxes effectively.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
