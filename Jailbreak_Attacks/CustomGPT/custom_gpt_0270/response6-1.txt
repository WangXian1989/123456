Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
- **IRA:** After maxing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. Taxable Accounts
- After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting extra funds into taxable accounts for flexibility.
- Use these accounts for investments that might be taxed at a lower rate (like long-term capital gains).

### Considerations
- **Age and Retirement Timeline:** Younger investors might focus on tax-advantaged growth, while those closer to retirement might prioritize liquidity and lower taxes.
- **Investment Goals:** Align asset allocation with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Conclusion
Explore a balanced approach, ensuring you maximize contributions where possible while considering your overall financial strategy. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
