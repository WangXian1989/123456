I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems typically include:

1. **Medication**: For conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver, specific medications may be prescribed.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and reducing alcohol intake can help.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
