Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key points to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if availableâ€”it's free money!
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions up to the limit if possible.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax; Roth 401(k) contributions are post-tax (money grows tax-free).

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.
   - **Investment Choices**: IRAs often provide more investment options than 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties; ideal for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.
   - **No Contribution Limits**: You can contribute as much as you want.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA first for tax benefits.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before overly investing.

### Example Distribution
1. Max out 401(k) contributions to get the employer match.
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA based on your tax bracket.
3. Use any remaining funds for a taxable account for flexibility and additional investing.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific situation.
