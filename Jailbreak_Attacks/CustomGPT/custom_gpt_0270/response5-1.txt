Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - Invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, or target-date funds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions if eligible, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Choose investments that align with your long-term growth strategy, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes, such as broad market index funds and tax-exempt bonds.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize maximizing your 401(k) contribution first (up to employer match).
- Then contribute to your IRA, optimizing for tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity after retirement accounts are adequately funded.

Remember to periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
