Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA after your 401(k) to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or emergency funds. They offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, stocks are held in tax-advantaged accounts, while fixed-income investments may be better suited for taxable accounts due to their lower tax implications.

5. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual needs.
