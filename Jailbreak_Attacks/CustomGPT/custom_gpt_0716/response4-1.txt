To provide you with personalized advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, let's start with identifying your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

1. **Goals**:
   - Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or something else?
   - What is your time horizon for these goals?

2. **Current Situation**:
   - What is your current contribution rate to each account (401(k), IRA, taxable)?
   - Are you receiving any employer match on your 401(k)?

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - How comfortable are you with investing? Would you prefer conservative investments, balanced approaches, or are you open to aggressive strategies?

Once I have this information, I can provide a more tailored distribution strategy.
