I'm glad you're looking to optimize your investment strategy! To provide a tailored response, I need more context regarding your financial situation. Here are some questions to consider:

1. **Current Age**: How old are you, and when do you plan to retire?
2. **Risk Tolerance**: What is your comfort level with risk? Are you conservative, moderate, or aggressive as an investor?
3. **Investment Goals**: What are you hoping to achieve with this investment distribution (e.g., retirement, buying a home, education)?
4. **Income**: What is your current income level, and are you anticipating any changes in income?
5. **Tax Considerations**: Are there specific tax concerns or goals you have in mind?

Once I have this information, I can offer guidelines on how to distribute your money effectively among these accounts!
