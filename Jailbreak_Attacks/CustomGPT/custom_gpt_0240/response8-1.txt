To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** After contributing to your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments that may be more tax-efficient, such as stocks (held long-term for capital gains) or municipal bonds (often tax-exempt). 
   - Consider keeping bonds or assets that generate high taxable income in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in liquid assets, separate from your investment accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) for risk management.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor, especially if your situation is complex.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while minimizing tax implications over time.
