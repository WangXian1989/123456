To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Focus on this if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA might be beneficial. If you anticipate a higher tax bracket, consider a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals and investments where you may want flexibility. Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

4. **Analyze Fees**: Check the fees associated with your accounts. Often, 401(k) plans can have higher fees than IRAs or taxable accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Max out to employer match (e.g., 5% of salary).
2. **IRA**: Contribute up to the annual limit (e.g., $6,500 for 2023).
3. **Taxable Account**: Allocate any additional savings here or invest any remainder after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Monitoring and Adjusting
Regularly review your investments and adjust as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.
