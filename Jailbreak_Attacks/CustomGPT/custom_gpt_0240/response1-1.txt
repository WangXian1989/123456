Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income, but taxes apply on withdrawals.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If eligible, prioritize this for tax-free growth.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce lower taxable events (like index funds, ETFs) or for holding shorter-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments across accounts to balance risk.

6. **Adjust for Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger individuals might favor growth in stock-heavy accounts, while those nearing retirement may want more stability.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on performance, goals, and life changes.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
