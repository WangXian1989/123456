When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions here, especially if your employer offers a match. This account grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions during contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility, but be aware of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to make the most of tax deferral.
   - Place more conservative assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they generate interest that is taxed at ordinary income rates.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay within annual contribution limits: for 401(k) ($22,500 for individuals under 50, $30,000 for those 50 and older) and IRA ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older) as of 2023.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund funded through your taxable accounts for easy access in case of unexpected expenses.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - Consider your timeline: if youâ€™re closer to retirement, shift more into conservative investments. 

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Financial Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your short-term and long-term financial goals, adjusting allocations as necessary.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
