Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can contribute to taxable accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made with after-tax money, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) since you won’t need the money for many years.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax burden from capital gains and dividends.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within asset classes across all accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review:**
   - Monitor your accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion:
- Start with your 401(k) for the match, then fund your IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts. Tailor your investments based on tax efficiency and your long-term financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
