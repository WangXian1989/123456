To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or real estate investment trusts) here to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that appreciate—like stocks—which may be taxed at lower capital gains rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and cash suited to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications. Taxable accounts might be drawn from first to help manage taxable income levels later in retirement.

5. **Consider Fees**:
   - Be aware of fees in each account type and look for low-cost investment options, especially in taxable accounts.

6. **Future Tax Expectations**:
   - Consider your current vs. future tax rates. If you expect your rate to rise, favor Roth accounts (like Roth IRAs) while you’re in a lower bracket.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
