To determine the best treatment options for liver issues, it's crucial to identify the specific condition affecting your liver. Common liver problems include fatty liver disease, hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Here are general treatment approaches for some common conditions:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars; consider a Mediterranean diet.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Hepatitis**: Antiviral medications for hepatitis B or C.
   - **Fatty Liver Disease**: Metformin or other medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to assess liver function.
   - Imaging tests (like ultrasounds) to monitor liver structure.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: For severe cirrhosis or liver failure.
   - **Interventional Procedures**: For liver tumors (like ablation).

Consult with a healthcare provider for a specific diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
