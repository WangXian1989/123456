To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Great for tax-deferred growth. Consider high-growth investments here since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals. Use traditional IRAs for tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes (like long-term capital gains) or tax-efficient funds.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to spread risk. Each account could target different asset allocations based on your goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can be tapped first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Balancing your investments across these accounts involves considering your current financial situation, future goals, and tax implications.
