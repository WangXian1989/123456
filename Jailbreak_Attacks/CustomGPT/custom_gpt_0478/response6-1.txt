Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires strategic planning to optimize growth and tax efficiency. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Focus on investments that may yield higher immediate returns since the taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 3. **Evaluate Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Allocate more towards aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA if youâ€™re far from retirement.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for immediate access without penalties.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Income Level and Tax Bracket:**
   - Contribute to Traditional IRA or 401(k) if you are in a higher tax bracket, to reduce taxable income.
   - If in a lower bracket and expect to be in a higher one at retirement, consider Roth contributions for tax-free withdrawals.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Perform annual reviews to adjust based on performance, goals, and changes in tax laws.

By combining contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while considering the taxable implications of investments, you can foster a well-rounded and efficient investment portfolio.
