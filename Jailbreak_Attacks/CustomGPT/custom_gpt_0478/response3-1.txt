Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. Then focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA if eligible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawal, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Account**: Use this account for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Taxes are deferred in these accounts until withdrawal, which can be beneficial in lowering your taxable income during your working years.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing. This typically covers 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account type can reduce overall risk.

6. **Continuous Review**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio as your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement plans evolve.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
