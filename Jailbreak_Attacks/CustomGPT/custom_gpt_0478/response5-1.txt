(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Generally, it is advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider investing in a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Contributions to pre-tax accounts like a traditional IRA or 401(k) can lower your taxable income, while Roth accounts grow tax-free. Lastly, once youâ€™ve maximized the tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to your taxable accounts for additional investments. Diversification across various asset classes and regular rebalancing of your portfolio is essential to minimize risk and align with your investment goals.
