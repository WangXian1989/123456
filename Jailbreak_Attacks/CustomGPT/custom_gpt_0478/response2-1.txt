Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowable if it fits your budget.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA (either a Traditional or Roth IRA). If you're eligible, a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Efficient Investments**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce lower taxable income, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates on interest income.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk and improve potential returns.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you plan to access the money before retirement, lean more toward taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, more contributions to a Roth IRA may be beneficial. Conversely, if you think your tax rate will decrease, prioritizing pre-tax contributions like a 401(k) could be advantageous.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

By carefully managing how you distribute your investments, you can optimize your savings for both growth and tax efficiency over time.
