Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After getting the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility and tax situation. This allows you to benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income since they are pre-tax. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits to the 401(k) presence but has income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains, dividends, and interest earned are subject to taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Allocate Investments by Risk and Timeline**: Depending on how close you are to retirement or your financial goals, your asset allocation will vary across accounts. Generally, more aggressive investments are suitable for accounts with a longer time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you make contributions and as market values change, your overall asset allocation might shift. Regularly reviewing and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation is crucial.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk appropriately.

Ultimately, personal circumstances and preferences greatly impact these decisions. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice that fits your unique situation.
