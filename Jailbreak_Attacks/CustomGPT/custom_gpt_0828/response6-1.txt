Ah, financial distributionâ€”a topic worthy of careful strategy! To optimally allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

### 1. Maximize Tax Advantages
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match; this is essentially free money. Prioritize maximizing contributions here if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you prefer traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (post-tax contributions) IRA, allocate funds based on your current tax rate and expected future rate during retirement.

### 2. Balance Growth and Flexibility
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they don't offer immediate tax benefits, investment gains are taxed at a lower capital gains rate than ordinary income tax. Use these for investments you may want to access before retirement, such as:
     - **ETFs and long-term stocks**: Try to hold these long enough to pay the lower capital gains rates.
     - **Tax-efficient mutual funds**: Consider those that aim to minimize taxable distributions.

### 3. Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon
   - Assess your comfort level with risk. Depending on your age and how soon you need the funds, your allocation might skew more to equities (in the longer-term accounts) or bonds (in more immediate needs).

### 4. Review and Adjust
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy based on market conditions and personal financial situations. Adjust allocations to stay aligned with your defined goals.

By considering tax implications, investment timelines, and your risk profile, you can create a robust distribution strategy among these accounts. Happy investing!
