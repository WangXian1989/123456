(Î±) When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach often depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for at least 10-15% of your income if possible.
   
2. **IRA Considerations**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for tax benefits. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing employer match in your 401(k) and contributing to your IRA, you can consider putting extra savings into a taxable investment account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains tax.

4. **Balanced Approach**: Assign your funds based on these priorities while considering your age, risk tolerance, and retirement horizon. Regularly reassess and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your investment strategy.
