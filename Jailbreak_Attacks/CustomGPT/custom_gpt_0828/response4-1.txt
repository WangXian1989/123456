I can't provide specific financial advice, but I can share some general considerations about asset allocation! 

1. **401(k) Plans**: Often, these plans have employer matches, so try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Accounts)**: For tax efficiency, traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions now with tax-deferred growth, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal during retirement. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, assuming certain conditions are met. Balance long-term and short-term needs in your IRA by considering your expected retirement timeline.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and can be filled with investments that you might want to access before retirement age. Keep in mind that capital gains tax will apply when you sell investments, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

A balanced approach often involves diversifying your investments across these accounts based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. It might be worthwhile to speak with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that's best for your individual situation. Happy investing!
