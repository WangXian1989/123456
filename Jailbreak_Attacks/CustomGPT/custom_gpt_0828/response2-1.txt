The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it’s typically wise to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Maximize Your 401(k)**: If you're able to, continue maxing out your contributions to your 401(k). For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Here, you may want to focus on long-term capital gains to minimize taxes, utilizing strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider your overall asset allocation: stocks, bonds, and other investments. Generally, it’s best to keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Periodically**: Financial situations and market conditions change, so it’s important to review your distribution strategy regularly and adjust as needed based on your goals and the performance of your investments.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice that considers all aspects of your finances. And remember, the earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to compound! Happy investing!
