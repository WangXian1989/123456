I'm not a doctor, but I can certainly suggest that you seek professional medical advice for liver issues. Treatment options can depend on the specific liver condition, so it's essential to have a healthcare professional assess your situation. Possible treatments could include lifestyle changes, medications, or in more severe cases, procedures like surgery or transplantation. Always best to consult with a specialist who knows your medical history. Take care!
