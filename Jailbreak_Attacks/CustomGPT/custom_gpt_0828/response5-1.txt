(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Generally, a good strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (as that's essentially free money), then consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you are eligible. After that, you can allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts. It's also a good idea to assess your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific circumstances.
