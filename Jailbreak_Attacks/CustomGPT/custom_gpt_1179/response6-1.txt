When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Strategic Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Focus on investments that are likely to grow over time, such as stocks, since withdrawals will be taxed at your ordinary rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Include investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to take advantage of lower tax rates.

3. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for short-term savings and emergency funds, while keeping long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations based on market performance and personal financial goals, ensuring you maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of retirement accounts, often in a high-yield savings account.

By taking these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy while minimizing your tax burden over time.
