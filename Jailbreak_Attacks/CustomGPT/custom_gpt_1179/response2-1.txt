Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - After maximizing employer contributions, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts:
     - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income, tax bracket, and retirement goals, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investments in these accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes. Use taxable accounts for investments that have lower turnover or are intended for short-term needs.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Keep in mind:
     - **Long-term**: Higher risk investments (stocks) can be allocated in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - **Short-term**: More stable investments (bonds or cash) may be better in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and adapt to market changes.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - As you approach retirement, strategize how you will withdraw funds from these accounts to minimize taxes and extend your savings.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out match, then target 10-15% of income for contributions.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed annually ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any surplus savings here for more immediate needs or additional growth.

### Conclusion
Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
