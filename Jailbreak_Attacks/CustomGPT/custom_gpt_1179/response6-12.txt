It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems, as treatment can vary significantly based on the underlying condition. However, common approaches for liver health issues include:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - **Dietary Changes**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications such as antiviral drugs or immunosuppressants may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and assess any changes.

4. **Supplements**:
   - Some may consider liver support supplements like milk thistle, but discuss these with a doctor beforehand.

5. **Avoid Toxins**:
   - Limit exposure to environmental toxins and avoid over-the-counter medications that can strain the liver.

Always follow up with your healthcare provider for a treatment plan tailored to your situation.
