Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're under the annual contribution limit, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) for tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) (or if your employer doesn't match), contribute to a Traditional IRA (if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire) or a Roth IRA (if you expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These are flexible and provide liquidity. Keep in mind, they may incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

5. **Consider Fees and Investment Choices**: Look at the fees associated with your 401(k) and available investment options. Sometimes, IRAs or taxable accounts offer better investments or lower fees.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Revisit your allocation periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.
