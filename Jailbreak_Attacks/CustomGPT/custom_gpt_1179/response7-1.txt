Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider the investment options available in the plan and their fees.

2. **IRA**:
   - Maximize your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation and eligibility.
   - A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (e.g., dividends, interest).
   - This can be a good place for short-term savings or investments you may need access to before retirement.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved before heavy investing.
- **401(k)**: Aim to maximize your contributions, especially if there's a match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed each year, prioritizing the account that benefits you tax-wise.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional funds for flexible, liquid investments after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Taxation**: Traditional accounts grow tax-deferred but are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts are tax-free on qualified distributions. Taxable accounts incur capital gains tax.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer horizons can tolerate more risk, while shorter ones should prioritize liquidity and stability.
