I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. The best treatment often depends on the specific liver condition. Here are some common options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or other specific drugs.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Surveillance through blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or liver tumors, surgical options including liver transplantation might be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some patients explore herbal supplements, but these should always be discussed with a healthcare provider to avoid liver damage.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
