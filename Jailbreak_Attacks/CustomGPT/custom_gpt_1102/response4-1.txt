To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-advantaged Accounts first**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your IRA and 401(k) before focusing heavily on taxable accounts. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth if certain conditions are met.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Target-date funds can be a good option.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Similar to your 401(k), focus on long-term growth investments. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider municipal bonds for tax-exempt income.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This approach balances tax efficiency and growth potential while considering your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.
