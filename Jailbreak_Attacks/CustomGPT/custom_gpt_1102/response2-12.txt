I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Eating a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Supplements**: Some may find benefit from liver-supportive supplements like milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up tests and scans to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

5. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: If diabetes or high cholesterol is an issue, managing those can improve liver health.

6. **End-Stage Treatment**: In severe cases, options like liver transplantation might be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
