Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, which can provide tax benefits. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you're eligible.

3. **Return to Your 401(k)**: After maxing out the IRA (if possible), go back to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. This can be useful for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations to adjust for life changes and market conditions.
