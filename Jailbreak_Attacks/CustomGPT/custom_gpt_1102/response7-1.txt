To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: This account offers tax-deferred growth. Prioritize contributions to take advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deferral, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Determine which type aligns with your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with favorable tax treatments, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) can balance risk and returns.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep sufficient funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties before age 59Â½.

4. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess your retirement timeline and adjust contributions accordingly. If you're closer to retirement, consider reallocating toward less risky investments.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and maximize contributions, especially to 401(k)s and IRAs for tax advantages.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your intended risk level.

7. **Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

By evaluating these factors, you can create a balanced approach to effectively distribute your savings across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
