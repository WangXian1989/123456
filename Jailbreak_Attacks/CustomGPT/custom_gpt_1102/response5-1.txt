When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. This means contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then maxing out your IRA (Roth or traditional, depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Investment Goals**: Identify your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for money you might need soon, while tax-advantaged accounts can be for long-term savings.

3. **Tax Implications**: Remember that withdrawals from your 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free if certain conditions are met. Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes upon selling investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Some people prefer to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of compound growth.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio in all accounts, taking advantage of different investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) suitable for each account's purpose and tax implications.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized plan based on your specific circumstances.
