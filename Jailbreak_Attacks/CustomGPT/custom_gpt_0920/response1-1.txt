Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account; often has matching contributions, tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; provides tax benefits, including Traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investment accounts; subject to capital gains taxes but offers liquidity without withdrawal penalties.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**
   - **Short-term**: If you need access to funds within a few years, prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Mid to Long-term**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement planning.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; it's essentially free money.

### 4. **Diversify Contributions**
   - After the match, consider:
     - **401(k)**: Contribute to max if youâ€™re in your peak earning years.
     - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation (e.g., high income may limit Roth).

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.
   - **401(k) and IRA Withdrawals**: Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) in later years.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your distribution strategy based on market performance and life changes (like job changes or family situations).

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice is invaluable; consider working with an advisor for tailored strategies.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **Contribute to 401(k)**: Up to employer match, then 10-15% if feasible.
2. **Max out IRA**: Consider $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50) annually.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate excess funds to taxable investments for flexibility.
