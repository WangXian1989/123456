Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to at least get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, max out your contributions for added tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your income and tax bracket.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you may need to access before retirement. Investments in taxable accounts can benefit from capital gains tax rates, which are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

### 3. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where potential gains can grow tax-deferred.
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and real estate investment trusts) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Each account can hold a mix of asset classes that align with your overall investment strategy.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Regularly review your allocations as your situation changes (age, income level, retirement plans) and make adjustments as necessary to remain aligned with your goals.

### Example Breakdown:
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of your income (or enough to get full employer match)
- **IRA**: Up to $6,500 per year (or $7,500 if over age 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation, helping you refine your strategy further.
