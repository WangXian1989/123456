To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: 2024 limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: 2024 limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but capital gains may incur taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - Maximize employer match in your 401(k) first, if available.
   - Contribute to an IRA for potential tax deductions or Roth benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once other accounts are maximized.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals**
   - **401(k)**: Long-term retirement savings, often with limited investment choices.
   - **IRA**: Flexibility in investment choices and potential tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short- to medium-term goals or for funds needed before retirement age.

### 4. **Distribution Strategy**
   - After funding your 401(k) and IRA to their limits, allocate additional savings to a taxable account.
   - Be mindful of asset location; consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation and goals.

### User Input
1. **Current Contributions:** What percentage are you currently contributing to each account?
2. **Retirement Timeline:** How many years until you plan to retire?
3. **Investment Goals:** What are your primary financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home, education)?

Feel free to refine your approach based on these considerations!
