Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **If available**, contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - **Consider an IRA** (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - Aim to contribute as much as possible to your 401(k), especially if you are in a higher income bracket, as it reduces your taxable income.

### 4. **Determine Taxable Investments**
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for:
     - Earning capital gains which may be taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.
     - Providing liquidity for goals outside retirement, as these funds can be accessed without penalties.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Diversification across different asset classes can help manage risk.

### 6. **Review Tax Implications**
   - Evaluate your current and future tax brackets to determine the best balance between tax-deferred (401(k) and IRA) and taxable accounts.

### 7. **Regularly Reassess Allocation**
   - As your income, goals, and tax situations change, periodically review and adjust your allocation.

### Example Strategy:
- **If you are under 50**: 
  - Contribute 10-15% of your income to your 401(k) (up to the contribution limit).
  - Contribute to an IRA (up to $6,500).
  - Invest additional funds in a taxable account.

- **If you are 50 or older**:
  - Take advantage of catch-up contributions in your 401(k) and IRA for increased savings.

### Conclusion:
The best approach involves maximizing retirement savings while considering your liquidity needs and long-term goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
