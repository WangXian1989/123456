The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically hinges on several factors including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize that to capture free money.

2. **Contribute to Traditional/Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA. A Roth IRA is a good option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket at retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you can, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment options that might not be available in retirement accounts.

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before heavily investing in these accounts. 

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and changes in your personal circumstances.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy appropriate for your specific situation. Each person's financial situation is unique!
