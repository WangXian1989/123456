The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your current tax situation and retirement plans. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’re maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and have extra funds, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility, especially for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline across all accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
