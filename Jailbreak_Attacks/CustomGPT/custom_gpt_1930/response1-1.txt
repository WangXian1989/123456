The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, whereas Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current vs. expected future tax rate, you might favor one type over the other.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Aim for a mix of growth and income investments across all your accounts. Consider holding assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping more aggressive growth investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement age without penalties. They also provide flexibility for withdrawing funds as needed.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life events.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your distribution strategy to your specific circumstances can yield better results, so consider getting professional advice.

It's crucial to align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.
