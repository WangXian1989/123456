The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money to other accounts. This is effectively free money and an excellent return on your investment.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of each account type. Your 401(k) and traditional IRA offer tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. In contrast, Roth IRAs (if applicable) and taxable accounts allow for tax-free growth or more favorable tax rates on capital gains.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across all accounts. Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your future withdrawal strategy. If you plan to retire early, having a Roth IRA or taxable account can provide greater flexibility since you can withdraw contributions from a Roth IRA tax-free and without penalties.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in any account, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible account to cover unexpected expenses.

6. **Consult a Professional**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation, ensuring all factors are considered.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that maximizes tax efficiency and aligns with your long-term financial goals is key.
