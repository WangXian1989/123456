To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, direct any additional funds to your taxable accounts.
   - This approach offers flexibility in accessing funds without penalties and provides the potential for long-term capital gains.

Evaluate your personal financial situation and goals, including current income, tax bracket, and retirement timeline, to determine the most advantageous distribution among these accounts. Diversification and proper allocation based on your risk tolerance are key to long-term growth. 

Moreover, consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice that fits your specific circumstances.
