To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if it offers tax benefits (Traditional vs. Roth). Contributions to a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each account type. Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, while tax-advantaged accounts allow for tax-deferred growth. You might want to place more income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider the investment horizon to tailor your strategy accordingly.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Review your asset allocation annually and adjust contributions and investments as necessary based on performance, changes in your financial goals, or life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best approach for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan.

By carefully considering these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to distributing your money effectively across your investment accounts.
