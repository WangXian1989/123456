To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are typically tax-deferred, while contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars and can grow tax-free. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on earnings.

3. **Balance for Flexibility**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This can help you access funds without penalties before retirement age, should the need arise.

4. **Long-term Growth Focus**: Consider investing in growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can benefit from compounding without immediate tax consequences.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts. This mitigates risk and can optimize overall returns.

6. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**: If you have short-term goals (like buying a house), focus on your taxable account. For long-term retirement goals, increase contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also provide insights tailored to your circumstances.
