To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Balance risk with a mix of bonds and equities, adjusting based on your retirement horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term needs to avoid penalties and taxes on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are better suited for long-term growth, allowing your money to compound over time.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and market changes.

### 5. **Tax Implications**
   - Be mindful of tax distributions from each account type, especially as you approach retirement.

By following these strategies, you can effectively manage your investment distribution while maximizing growth and tax efficiency.
