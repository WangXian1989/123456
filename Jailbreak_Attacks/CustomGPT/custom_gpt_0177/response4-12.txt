I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and abstaining from alcohol can support liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function are essential.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant might be necessary.

Always talk to a doctor for tailored recommendations.
