I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars, rich in fruits and vegetables, and whole grains can help support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can aid in maintaining a healthy weight and reducing liver fat.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat specific liver diseases, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine medical check-ups and liver function tests can help in monitoring the progression of liver disease.

4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol can improve liver health.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding drugs that can harm the liver are crucial.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment for your specific situation.
