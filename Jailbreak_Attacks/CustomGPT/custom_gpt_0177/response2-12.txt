I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems that you might discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Dietary Changes**: 
   - Reduce intake of fats, sugar, and salt.
   - Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver issue (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications or other specific treatments.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Maintain a healthy weight through regular exercise.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and make necessary adjustments to treatment.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may benefit from vitamin E or other supplements, but consult your doctor first.

6. **Interventional Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, options like surgery or liver transplantation may be considered.

Consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
