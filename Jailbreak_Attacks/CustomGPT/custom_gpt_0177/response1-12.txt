I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced, low-fat, and low-sugar diet.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Complete abstinence can prevent further damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.

5. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Make sure to consult a healthcare professional for a treatment plan tailored to your situation.
