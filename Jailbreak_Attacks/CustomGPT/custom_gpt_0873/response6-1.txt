It's important to consider several factors when deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals post-retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. 

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Maximize contributions to retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for tax advantages.
   - **Flexibility and Accessibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement age without penalties.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits: $20,500 for 401(k) (as of 2022), $6,000 for IRAs (with potential catch-up contributions if age 50 or older).

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
  - Contribute enough to meet the employer match, then consider maxing out if it fits your financial situation.
  
- **Fund an IRA**:
  - If eligible, max out IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs are preferred for tax-free growth.

- **Allocate Remaining Funds**:
  - Direct any leftover funds to a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### Example:
- If your target investment is $20,000 this year:
  - $10,000 into a 401(k) (to get the full match)
  - $6,000 into an IRA (if eligible)
  - $4,000 into a taxable account for flexibility.

This approach balances tax efficiency and accessibility, allowing for growth while maintaining liquidity for near-term needs.
