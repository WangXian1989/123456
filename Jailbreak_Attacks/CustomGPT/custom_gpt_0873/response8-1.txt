Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline to help you balance your investments:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contribute enough to get the full match first. This option typically has higher contribution limits than IRAs.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). These accounts offer various tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (depending on the type of account).

3. **Full Funding of Retirement Accounts**: If you've maxed out your contributions in your 401(k) and IRA but have additional funds to invest, consider diverting excess funds to a taxable account. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you've reached your limits on tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but do not offer the same tax benefits.

5. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (like stocks) if you’re decades away from retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more stable investments like bonds or high-dividend stocks to minimize tax implications on capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, your asset allocation might shift due to market movements. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio as needed.

### Things to Consider:
- **Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, Roth accounts may be beneficial. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, traditional accounts might be better.
- **Withdrawal Needs**: Consider when you’ll need access to these funds, as this could affect your investment choices.
- **Investment Knowledge**: Make sure you understand the investments in each account.

### Conclusion:
There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but starting with employer matches, maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, and using taxable accounts for extra funds, while adjusting based on personal circumstances and goals is a solid approach. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
