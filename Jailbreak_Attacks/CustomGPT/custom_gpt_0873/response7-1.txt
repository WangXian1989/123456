Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if possible. This account has tax advantages, as contributions are typically pre-tax.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible for a traditional or Roth IRA, consider maxing this out after your 401(k) contributions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can benefit you if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals, but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, equities can be held in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while fixed income could be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments across all accounts to ensure they align with your overall financial plan and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
