I’m not a financial advisor, but I can give you some general insights on distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first. Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you believe you’ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA might offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility for withdrawals but will be taxed on gains.

**General Steps**:
- Ensure emergency savings are in place.
- Prioritize contributions based on tax implications, employer matching, and investment goals.
- Periodically re-evaluate your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and changing financial circumstances.

Always consider consulting with a financial professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
