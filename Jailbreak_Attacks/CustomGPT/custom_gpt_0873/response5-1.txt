(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among different types of accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Generally, tax-advantaged accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs should be prioritized for long-term investments since they can offer tax deferral or tax-free growth. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match since it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax filing status, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: If you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that down first, along with keeping a healthy emergency fund.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: After funding your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility, especially if you might need access to funds before retirement age.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.

Then, switch gears to an IRAâ€”either Traditional or Roth, depending on how much you love the idea of post-retirement tax benefits. If youâ€™ve got high-interest debt, slam that down first, because those interest rates will eat you alive faster than a bad horror movie! After youâ€™ve got the basics covered, let those taxable accounts flex their muscles, especially if you want liquidity or you're planning to make some moves before you kick back and retire. And hey, why not chat with a financial advisor for the extra spice? Theyâ€™ll give you that fine-tuned strategy.
