I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific conditions affecting your liver. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or, in severe cases, surgical interventions. It's crucial to seek personalized advice from a medical expert who can understand your situation fully.
