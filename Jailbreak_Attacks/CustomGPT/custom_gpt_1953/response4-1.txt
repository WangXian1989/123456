It's important to devise a strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to receive any employer match as it's essentially "free money."
   - Focus on maxing out your 401(k) if youâ€™re closer to retirement since it grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA is a good option if you want to reduce your taxable income now, but remember taxes will be due upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
   - Taxable accounts are optimal for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Consideration of Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of tax implications for each account type; tax-deferred accounts give you immediate tax breaks but tax liabilities upon withdrawal.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

You may want to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy to your personal situation.
