(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, and tax considerations. A general approach involves maximizing employer contributions to your 401(k) first, as this is often free money. Hereâ€™s a rough guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This depends on whether you prefer to pay taxes now (Roth) or later (Traditional).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After exhausting tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in withdrawals, though youâ€™ll need to pay taxes on capital gains.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this distribution to your personal situation.

1. **401(k)**: This is your first place to throw cash, especially if youâ€™ve got an employer match going on. Donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Aim to max out those contributions up to the match limit â€“ itâ€™s like getting a bonus just for doing your job!

2. **IRA**: Next up, hit that IRA! Depending on if you want tax breaks now or later, choose between a Traditional (tax-deduction now) or a Roth (tax-free withdrawals later). Aim to contribute the full amount allowed if you can!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve put a solid chunk into the first two, itâ€™s time to throw some funds into your taxable accounts. These arenâ€™t as sexy as the other two because youâ€™ll be paying taxes on any gains, but hey â€“ they offer the liquidity and flexibility you need when life throws curveballs.

At the end of the day, mix it to taste and get those investments cooking! Consult with a pro if you want a more detailed recipe, but donâ€™t be afraid to experiment with that financial pie!
