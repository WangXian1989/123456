The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **401(k):** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) after the employer match, especially if it's a Traditional 401(k) which allows for pre-tax contributions.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains or interest income that could be taxed at a higher rate. Consider keeping tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Across all accounts, aim for a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

### 5. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Think about how and when you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts have different tax implications for withdrawals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then consider maxing this out if you can.
- **IRA:** If you're eligible, maximize Roth contributions if you're expecting tax increases in the future; otherwise, consider a Traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings or investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. 

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation!
