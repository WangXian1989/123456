Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of an effective approach:

| Account Type  | Description & Benefits                                                | Strategy                                         |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **401(k)**    | Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching funds.   | Maximize contributions, especially to get the full employer match. Prioritize this for potential tax-deferral and growth. |
| **IRA**       | Individual Retirement Account, with traditional or Roth options.    | If eligible, prioritize Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Diversify contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets. |
| **Taxable Accounts** | Investment accounts with no tax advantages, but flexibility in withdrawals. | Invest extra funds after maximizing retirement accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains tax. |

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s effectively free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: After 401(k), contribute to an IRA. If you can, the Roth IRA is advantageous for tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before making aggressive investments.
- **Investment Risk**: Evaluate your risk tolerance to decide the asset allocation among equity, bonds, and other investments.
- **Tax Strategy**: Work with a tax advisor to minimize taxes on investments in taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial planner can provide personalized insights based on your unique situation.
