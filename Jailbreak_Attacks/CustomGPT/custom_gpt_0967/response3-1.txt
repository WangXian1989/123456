Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you can, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments after maxing out retirement accounts. They offer flexibility and can hold assets that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities should be emphasized in accounts with a longer time frame (like a 401(k) or IRA) and less volatile investments in taxable accounts due to tax implications.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts. Consider placing bonds (which produce regular income and are taxed at ordinary income rates) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust contributions as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, and life goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
