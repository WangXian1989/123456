Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but you have more flexibility in accessing your money.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For short-term goals, consider holding investments in a taxable account for easier access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified investment strategy across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may opt for more aggressive investments in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement might want more conservative allocations.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing life circumstances.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
