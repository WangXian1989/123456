Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. Assess Your Current and Future Tax Bracket
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividend stocks or interest-bearing accounts), ensuring you have enough liquidity for short-term needs.

### 3. Prioritize Based on Your Financial Goals
- **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments since they grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
- **Short-Term Needs:** Reserve a portion for taxable accounts to maintain liquidity for unexpected expenses.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out contributions to take full advantage of any employer match (e.g., 15% of your salary).
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount (e.g., $6,500 if under age 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining funds or save for short-term goals.

### Final Considerations
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your investments based on performance and your changing financial situation.
- **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

By carefully assessing these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your overall financial goals.
