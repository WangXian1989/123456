Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA** funds are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket then.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is great for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals you plan to achieve in the short- to medium-term (like buying a house or funding education). Keep in mind that you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Timeline**:
   - If you're younger and can afford to take risks, invest more in equities in your tax-advantaged accounts. If you're closer to retirement, consider a more conservative allocation, potentially increasing fixed-income investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

**Example Allocation**:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%

However, this is just a starting point; adjusting based on your personal circumstances is essential. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
