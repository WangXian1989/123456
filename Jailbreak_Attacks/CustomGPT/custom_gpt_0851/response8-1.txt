Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** After maxing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. This can lower your taxable income now.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may require more liquidity or that you might need to access before retirement. These accounts offer flexibility but come with tax implications on capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy:** Consider your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, more aggressive investments (stocks) can go into tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments (bonds) might fit well in taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency:** Prioritize holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Reviews:** Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial circumstances, goals, or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
