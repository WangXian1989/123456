Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, making it great for saving on taxes now. Consider maxing out the employer match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deduction benefits, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexible, short-term investments. They lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts but provide access to your cash without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon. For long-term goals (retirement), you can take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts since they have a longer growth period.
   - For shorter-term goals or those within 5 years, consider conservative options in taxable accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your asset allocation according to your risk tolerance. Typically, equities can be preferred for retirement accounts, while bonds may be suitable for taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consultation**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize growth and manage taxes effectively.
