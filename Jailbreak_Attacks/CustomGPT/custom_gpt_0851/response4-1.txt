To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - The 401(k) offers tax-deferred growth, making it a good choice for long-term savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - Check income limits for Roth IRA contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - This can be valuable for short-term goals or if you might need access to funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate income (like bonds) to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach allows for tax efficiency and aligns with both short- and long-term financial objectives.
