Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider placing investments that tend to generate high turnover or dividends in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification and Risk**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks might go in your Roth IRA (if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later), while bonds could be in your taxable accounts for lower tax implications.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, as this will influence how you allocate funds now.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
