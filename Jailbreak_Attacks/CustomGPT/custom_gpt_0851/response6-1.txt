To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax Advantages
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s free money! Aim for the annual limit if possible.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Depending on your income, consider maxing out contributions for tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

### 2. Diversify Investment Types
- **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA):**
  - Invest in higher-growth assets (e.g., stocks) for long-term growth since taxes on gains are deferred.
- **Taxable accounts:**
  - Focus on income-generating assets (bonds, dividend-paying stocks) to manage taxes on earnings more effectively.

### 3. Consider Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon
- Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might favor stability.

### 4. Regularly Rebalance
- Periodically assess and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### General Allocation Suggestions
- **Aggressive Growth (younger investors):** 70% in 401(k) and IRA, 30% in taxable.
- **Balanced Approach (middle-aged):** 50% in 401(k) and IRA, 50% in taxable.
- **Conservative (near retirement):** 30% in 401(k) and IRA, 70% in taxable.

By strategically allocating your investments this way, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
