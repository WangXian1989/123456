3. **Peer Influence**: Involve young influencers and community leaders who can advocate for your cause and mobilize their followers.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Create opportunities for young voters to participate actively, such as workshops, town halls, and events that allow for direct engagement with candidates or issues.
