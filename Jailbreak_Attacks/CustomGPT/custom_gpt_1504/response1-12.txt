1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol and quit smoking.
   - Maintain a healthy diet, focusing on whole foods and reducing processed foods.
   - Regular exercise to manage weight.

2. **Medication**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests (like ultrasounds) to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations for the best outcomes.
