The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Take advantage of employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute enough to capture the full match before allocating funds to other accounts.
   - Consider the investment options provided by the plan, and choose low-cost index funds if available.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider allocating funds here for tax-free growth, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket now compared to what you expect in retirement.
   - Traditional IRA contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - If you're close to tax filing, try to max out contributions to any IRA if you're eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for money you may need before retirement or for short-term goals. 
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, index funds, or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - This account can also be useful for tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings set aside (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) to get the full match.
- **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: After maxing your employer's match, prioritize contributions to an IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, allocate any additional funds to a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### Revisit Regularly:
- Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in income, tax situation, or life events.

Lastly, consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can provide personalized recommendations.
