The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions on your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA because your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might need to be accessed before retirement, as they provide more flexibility without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs involve pre-tax contributions, meaning withdrawals are taxed as income in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts may require you to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but they offer more control over when you incur tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across accounts are diversified in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk.

6. **Review Investment Options**: 401(k) plans may have limited investment choices, while IRAs and taxable accounts generally offer more flexibility. 

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your unique situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient approach to distributing your money across these different types of accounts. Would you like any specific advice on investment options or strategies?
