I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that may be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A healthy diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and alcohol can help improve liver health. Foods rich in fiber, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids are often recommended.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: For many liver issues, particularly fatty liver disease, abstaining from alcohol can be beneficial.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed. For example, antiviral medications for Hepatitis B or C, or medications to reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Treating any underlying conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity can also benefit liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring and Check-ups**: 
   - Frequent monitoring of liver function tests and imaging studies may be necessary to assess the progression of the disease.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, where there is significant liver damage, surgical options such as liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized medical advice and treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
