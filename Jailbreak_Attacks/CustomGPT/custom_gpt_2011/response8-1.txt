The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Depending on your current tax rate versus your expected rate in retirement, you might prefer one to the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell, and dividends are taxed in the year they are received. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but should be used for short-term goals or after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts may hold different types of investments based on their tax treatment and your financial goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your potential withdrawal needs in retirement. Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility without penalties, while tax-advantaged accounts may have specific withdrawal rules.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Align your investments with your long-term goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, consider taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture and goals. 

In conclusion, a balanced approach, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts while keeping liquidity and your specific goals in mind, will typically yield the best results for your financial planning.
