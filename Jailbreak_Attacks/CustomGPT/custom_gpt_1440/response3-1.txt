Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for additional tax benefits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you can, increase your contributions to your 401(k) after maximizing your IRA if your 401(k) has low fees and a good selection of investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term financial goals or when you need more liquidity, as they offer flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Investment Focus**: Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and bond funds or less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review your allocations based on market changes, tax laws, and your personal situation.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance is also a good idea.
