To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: First, ensure you’re contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out your IRA, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds into taxable accounts, focusing on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Distribute investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, usually placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative ones in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.
