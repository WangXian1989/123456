To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out if you can.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Max out if possible.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Hold income-generating assets here to defer taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth without immediate tax impact.
   - Allocate bonds or fixed income to taxable accounts, as their interest is taxed at ordinary income rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy for Retirement**:
   - In retirement, plan to withdraw from accounts strategically to minimize taxes. For example, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then 401(k) or IRA, considering tax brackets.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Review and rebalance your allocations periodically based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
