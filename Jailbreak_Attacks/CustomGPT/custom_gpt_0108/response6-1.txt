To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax-deferred growth.
   - **Utilize Roth Accounts**: If available, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Align Risk with Time Horizon**: Invest more aggressively in accounts with a longer time horizon, like a 401(k) or IRA, where early withdrawals may incur penalties.
   - **Diversify Across Accounts**: Maintain a mix of asset classes in each account type to optimize returns and reduce risk.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Plan for Minimum Distributions**: Understand when youâ€™ll need to start taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your Traditional IRA and 401(k) to avoid penalties.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies, allowing for easier access without penalties.

### Conclusion
Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to your situation.
