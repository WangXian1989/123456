Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. If possible, aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Taxable accounts are useful for investments you may need to access before retirement. They also allow for tax-loss harvesting.
   - Prioritize investing in tax-advantaged accounts first to maximize growth potential over time.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Consider allocating bonds or income-generating assets in your taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a balanced approach across all accounts. Diversify between asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.
   - Use a holistic view of your investments to achieve your desired risk tolerance and return goals.

5. **Regular Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically assess your allocations, especially as you approach retirement or significant financial goals.
   - Be mindful of changes in tax laws or personal income situations.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances and help ensure your investment decisions align with your long-term financial goals.
