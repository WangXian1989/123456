I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintain a healthy diet, avoid alcohol, and exercise regularly.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track your liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Please discuss with your doctor for personalized advice.
