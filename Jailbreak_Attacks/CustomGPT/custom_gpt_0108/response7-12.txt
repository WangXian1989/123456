1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoiding alcohol.
   - Following a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Liver Transplant**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered if the liver is severely damaged.
