Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Growth**: Focus on tax-efficient investments since contributions are made pre-tax.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Roth IRA for Tax-Free Growth**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA for Immediate Tax Benefits**: If you need tax deductions now, focus on Traditional IRA contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain liquidity for short-term needs.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Aim for at least the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute up to the max limit after 401(k) contributions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for investments that provide liquidity and flexibility.

### Final Considerations
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust the distribution as your financial situation changes.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific needs and tax situation.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth while considering tax implications.
