Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Fully fund your IRA if eligible (traditional or Roth).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Good for long-term growth. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest for flexibility and liquidity. Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

3. **Investment Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Use for a mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Consider holding more volatile assets here for potentially higher returns.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Assess Your Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is far off, you might lean more heavily toward growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies before fully investing.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
