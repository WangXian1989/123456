To determine the best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Liability:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for short-term investments or money you might need to access before retirement, as they don't carry the same tax advantages. However, consider investments that yield qualified dividends to lower your tax burden.
   - **Tax Implications of Withdrawals:** Understand the tax rates on withdrawals from each account type when planning your distributions during retirement.

### Strategy Summary:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
- Diversify by keeping a portion of funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
- Regularly re-evaluate your allocations based on changes in tax laws, income, and retirement goals.

By balancing these factors, you'll optimize your investment strategy, helping secure your financial future effectively.
