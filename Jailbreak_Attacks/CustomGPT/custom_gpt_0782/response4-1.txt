It's important to consult with a financial advisor or use a financial planning tool to determine the best strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts based on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, many people consider several factors when deciding how to allocate their investments across these different types of accounts. Here are some common considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Contributions to a 401(k) are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Many employers also offer matching contributions, which is essentially "free money." It's typically best to contribute enough to get the full match if available.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs may allow tax-deductible contributions, and the investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. Deciding between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA often depends on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals. It's essential to consider tax implications on capital gains when investing in these accounts, as well as your short-term vs. long-term investment goals.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) is crucial to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your target retirement age and how you intend to withdraw funds. Some strategies suggest withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts in retirement, depending on your tax situation at that time.

Ultimately, determining the best allocation among these accounts requires personal analysis of your financial situation, goals, and tax implications.
