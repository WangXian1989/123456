The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored plans (401(k)):**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider tax implications:**
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - Roth IRAs use after-tax money, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which may be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Assess your investment options:**
   - Look at the fees and investment choices available in your 401(k). If they are not competitive, you might want to contribute less to it.

4. **Allocate funds according to your risk tolerance:**
   - Typically, younger investors can afford to take more risks and allocate a larger percentage to stocks, while those closer to retirement may want to focus more on bonds and stable investments.

5. **Diversify across accounts:**
   - Distribute your investments to ensure diversification. For example, you might have equities in your 401(k), bonds in your IRA, and a mix of both or other assets in your taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance regularly:**
   - Periodically check your allocations to ensure they align with your strategy and adjust as needed.
