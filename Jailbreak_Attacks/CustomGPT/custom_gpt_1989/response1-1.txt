To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Assess Tax Impact**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals, making them ideal for retirement planning.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate income you can handle at a lower tax rate.

3. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid assets in taxable accounts for emergencies or immediate needs.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Balance your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your investment strategy based on life changes (age, income changes, market conditions).

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to manage tax implications efficiently.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual situation.
