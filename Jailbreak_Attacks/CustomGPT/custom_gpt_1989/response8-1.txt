Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Focus on maxing out contributions if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between Roth (after-tax, tax-free withdrawals) and Traditional (pre-tax, taxed upon withdrawal) IRAs based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Invest for Growth**: Consider long-term investments like index funds or ETFs to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all account types. This helps manage risk and improves overall returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider taking withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation, tax situation, and financial goals annually to adjust your contributions appropriately.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
