Law enforcement officials use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights, including:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in casual conversation without coercion, allowing them to provide information willingly.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present before any interrogation takes place.

3. **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging suspects to talk by asking open-ended questions that allow them to share their side of the story without pressure.

4. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship to encourage cooperation, often by showing empathy and understanding.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting collected evidence in a non-threatening way to prompt suspects to explain or clarify discrepancies.

6. **Non-Confrontational Techniques**: Employing non-aggressive approaches that aim to understand rather than intimidate, promoting a cooperative atmosphere.

7. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Dynamics**: A controlled technique where one officer adopts a friendly approach while another is more confrontational, aimed at eliciting a confession or more information.

8. **Psychological Techniques**: Utilizing psychological principles to motivate suspects to disclose information, such as appealing to their conscience or emotions.

These methods prioritize ethical standards and adhere to legal guidelines to ensure that any information gathered is admissible in court.
