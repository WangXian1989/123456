Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, subject to income limits.

3. **Fund a 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, particularly if it has low fees and a wide range of investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax burden.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals.

7. **Consider Withdrawals**: Be mindful of when you plan to withdraw funds, as this may impact your strategy, particularly with tax implications.

Consulting a financial advisor is also a good idea for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
