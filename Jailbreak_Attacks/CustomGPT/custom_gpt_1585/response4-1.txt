Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the income limit if there’s no employer match.
   - **IRA**: Once you've maxed your contributions (or at least are contributing regularly), consider funding a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts can be useful for short-term savings goals or more accessible funds as they don’t have withdrawal penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.
   - Place less tax-efficient options (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   
5. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your long-term strategy for withdrawals. For instance, withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA will have tax implications once you start taking distributions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It’s often beneficial to discuss your specific situation with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your needs.

Adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes, and ensure that you regularly reevaluate your asset allocation in response to your goals and market conditions.
