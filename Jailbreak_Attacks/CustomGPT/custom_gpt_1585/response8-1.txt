To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers pre-tax contributions, which lowers your taxable income. Consider contributing to a Roth 401(k) if your employer offers it, for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short-term needs or specific goals (like buying a home). Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments are suitable for tax-advantaged accounts where the growth isn't taxed until withdrawal.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation across accounts periodically to reflect changes in your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient cash reserve outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, which helps keep your investments intact.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given that individual circumstances vary, consider getting personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax bracket.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-balanced investment strategy that maximizes growth while considering tax implications.
