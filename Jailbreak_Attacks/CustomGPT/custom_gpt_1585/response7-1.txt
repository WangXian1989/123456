To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a top priority.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA, especially if you can benefit from tax deductions (e.g., traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (e.g., Roth IRA).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings goals you plan to use in the near term or if you prefer more investment flexibility. These accounts can be useful for withdrawing funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider how to allocate your investments based on your goals and time horizon. Generally, growth-oriented assets like stocks might be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments could be in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes effectively.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts, while holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in your tax-advantaged accounts where possible.

6. **Annual Reviews**: Regularly assess your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your changing goals, age, and market conditions.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
