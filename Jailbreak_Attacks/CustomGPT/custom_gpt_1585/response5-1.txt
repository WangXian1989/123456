Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you qualify, maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA can be advantageous due to tax-free growth.

3. **401(k) Contributions Beyond Match**: After the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) if you still have room in the contribution limit. This can be beneficial for tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds before retirement. These can hold investments that benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure each account type is appropriately allocated based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. You might consider stocks in taxable accounts for the tax benefits, while bonds could be in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as market conditions change.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications for withdrawing funds in retirement to minimize tax burdens.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
