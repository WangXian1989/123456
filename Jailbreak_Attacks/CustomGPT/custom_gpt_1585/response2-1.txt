Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
     - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed. For 2024, this is typically around $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
     - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax scenario. The limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 2. **Account Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**:
     - Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now.
     - Generally higher contribution limits.
     - Limited investment choices based on your plan.
   - **IRA**:
     - Tax advantages depend on traditional vs. Roth.
     - Greater investment flexibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - No contribution limits, but less favorable tax treatment on gains (e.g., short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income).
     - Useful for goals that are shorter-term or not suited for retirement accounts.

### 3. **Consider Taxes**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) are beneficial for reducing current taxable income.
   - Tax-free growth accounts (Roth IRA) are helpful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for assets that may produce higher taxable income (like bonds) or for investments you might need to access sooner.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Consider your age and how close you are to retirement. Younger investors might be more aggressive, while those nearing retirement should consider more conservative investments.
   - **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, or life circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the employer match.
- Max out your IRA.
- Allocate any additional savings to your 401(k) until you reach the limit, then use taxable accounts for additional funds.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the best strategy will align with your long-term financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
