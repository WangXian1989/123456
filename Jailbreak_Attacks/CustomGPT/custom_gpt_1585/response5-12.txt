I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare provider for personalized medical advice, but here are some common treatment options based on various liver conditions:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Dietary modifications, such as reducing alcohol intake, eating a balanced diet, and maintaining a healthy weight, are crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation or surgery to remove liver tumors may be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Support**: Consulting with a nutritionist to adjust your diet can help support liver health.

Always follow up with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.
