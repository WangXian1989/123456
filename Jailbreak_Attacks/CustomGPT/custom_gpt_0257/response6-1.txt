The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Consider maxing out these accounts next, focusing on Roth if you expect higher future taxes.

### 2. **Diversify Investment Types**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Invest in higher-growth assets here since you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for more stable investments to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient funds.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, it may be beneficial to contribute to a Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free withdrawals later.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Assess your distribution annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impact in retirement; you may draw from taxable accounts first for lower tax burdens.

### Key Points:
- **Emergency Fund:** Always maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts.
- **Investment Knowledge:** Ensure you understand the investments you choose in each account type.

By tailoring your approach based on your specific circumstances, you can effectively manage your money across these accounts.
