Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid savings account.

### 2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money!).
   - Max out contributions if possible, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.

### 3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRA is viable for tax deductions now if you're in a lower bracket.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for goals within 5 years, like buying a home or starting a business.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (e.g., index funds).

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Determine a balanced allocation between stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth assets (stocks) and bonds in taxable for tax efficiency.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your portfolio annually to maintain your target asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

By considering these factors, you can create a tailored strategy for distributing your funds effectively.
