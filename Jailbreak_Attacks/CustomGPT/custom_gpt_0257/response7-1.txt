To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Define your retirement goals and timeline. The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments should be.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

3. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA as they offer tax benefits. 
   - For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50), while the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance across all accounts. 

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - A 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deferred, meaning you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. 
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, so consider using them if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Monitor Fees**:
   - Keep an eye on management fees in your accounts, especially in 401(k)s, as high fees can erode returns over time.

8. **Stay Informed**:
   - Keep up with changes in tax laws and contribution limits to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth opportunities.

By aligning your investments with your financial goals and understanding the tax implications, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money across these accounts.
