Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Best if you anticipate a lower tax rate in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect your tax rate to increase.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you’re aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalty at any age.
   - **Capital Gains:** Be mindful of taxes on capital gains and interest income. Long-term investments typically incur lower tax rates.

### **General Guidelines**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily.
- **Investment Diversification:** Spread funds across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) for balanced risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
- **Consider Age and Retirement Timeline:**
   - Younger individuals may favor higher risk in growth-focused accounts (e.g., taxable accounts).
   - Near-retirement individuals might prioritize stable income in tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Final Thoughts**
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific circumstances, as they can provide personalized insights based on your financial picture.
