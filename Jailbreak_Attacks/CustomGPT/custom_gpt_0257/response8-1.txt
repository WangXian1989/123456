The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, consider prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (such as 401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes (like long-term capital gains) or for flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some money in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as they are more accessible without penalties.

7. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for each type of account when deciding how much to allocate.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation in all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
