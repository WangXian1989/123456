I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet (low in saturated fats and sugars).
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Complete abstinence can help liver recovery.

4. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: 
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
