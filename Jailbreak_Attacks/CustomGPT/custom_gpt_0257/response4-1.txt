Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially to take advantage of any employer match.
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments if you have a long time horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Contribute to an IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
   - Choose a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals will be tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends or interest).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid assets in savings for emergencies.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Tax Implications**: Think about when you'll need the money and the tax implications of withdrawals.

### Strategy:
- **Prioritize** retirement account contributions to maximize tax benefits.
- **Adjust** the allocation based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.
- **Review** your distribution regularly and adjust as needed based on life changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice is often beneficial.
