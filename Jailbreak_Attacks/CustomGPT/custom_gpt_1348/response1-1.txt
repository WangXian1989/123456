Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's often wise to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the annual contribution limit if you can afford it, as it lowers your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can have different tax implications. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Assess your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement to decide which IRA type is more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), additional investments in taxable accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that might generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or ETFs, to mitigate tax liability.

4. **Diversification and Risk Consideration**: 
   - Make sure to diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and account types for risk management.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily, as this can prevent the need to withdraw from investment accounts at inopportune times.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If you’re unsure how to balance your investments or what strategy is best for you, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so it’s important to create a strategy that aligns with your personal goals and circumstances!
