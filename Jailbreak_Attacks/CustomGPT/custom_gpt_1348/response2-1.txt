The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may also be tax-deductible, similar to a 401(k), with tax on distributions in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates, depending on how long you hold the assets.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you plan to retire soon, you might want to be more conservative in your investments and focus on preserving capital.
   - If you're younger and have a longer time horizon, you may lean towards more aggressive investments, potentially putting more into growth-oriented funds in your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts:** You might consider diversifying your investments across all accounts. For example, you could hold more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a Roth IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts (like bonds).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawal strategy in advance. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. 

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Your financial situation and goals may change, so it’s essential to review your asset allocation regularly and adjust as needed.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:** If you’re unsure about the best approach for your specific circumstances, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can develop a strategy that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your investment growth potential.
