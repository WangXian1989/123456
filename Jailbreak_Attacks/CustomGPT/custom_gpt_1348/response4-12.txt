I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment options tailored specifically to your liver problem. Depending on the condition, treatment options may vary widely, including lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. Please seek advice from a qualified medical provider.
