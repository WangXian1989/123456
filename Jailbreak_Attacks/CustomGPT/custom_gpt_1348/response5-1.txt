(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a matching contribution, as it provides tax advantages and helps accumulate retirement savings. Next, consider contributing to an IRA, which can offer additional tax benefits depending on the type (Traditional or Roth). 

After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider taxable accounts for savings and investments since they provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. A suggested strategy might be to prioritize contributions as follows: first, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA if possible, before allocating remaining funds to your taxable accounts. Additionally, it might be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation.
