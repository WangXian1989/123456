Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly influence your long-term financial strategy. Here are a few considerations to help guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, assess your 401(k) contributions based on your tax situation. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

3. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred. This could be a good option if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect a higher tax rate in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investing in taxable accounts after contributing sufficiently to tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts are flexible and allow for easy access to funds, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts last.

7. **Review Annually**: Regularly assess your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

Itâ€™s also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific goals and financial situation.
