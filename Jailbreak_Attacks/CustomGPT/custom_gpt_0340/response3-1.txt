To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these principles:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering taxable income. Consider maxing out employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess when you need the funds. Short-term needs might be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term savings can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) to manage risk.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts to optimize tax benefits.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings separate from these accounts.

This strategy balances tax efficiency and investment growth tailored to your financial goals and retirement timeline. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
