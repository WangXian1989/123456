I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintain a healthy weight to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures such as hepatobiliary interventions or, in extreme cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some may explore herbal supplements or acupuncture, but consult with a doctor first.

Always prioritize professional guidance tailored to your specific situation.
