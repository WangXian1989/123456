Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Assess Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher ordinary income tax rates.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Adjust allocations annually based on performance and changes in financial goals.

This strategy ensures you optimize for both growth and tax efficiency across your investment accounts.
