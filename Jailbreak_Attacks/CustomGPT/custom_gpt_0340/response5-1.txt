(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider investing in an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for more accessible funds and investments with favorable tax treatments, like long-term capital gains.

A common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA, before funding taxable accounts. Review your investment allocations based on risk tolerance and adjust based on market conditions and personal needs.
