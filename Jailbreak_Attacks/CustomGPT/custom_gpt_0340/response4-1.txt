Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Focus on maxing this out, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth. Choose based on your current vs. future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideally for flexibly accessible funds, but growth is taxed. Use this for funds you might need in the short term.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes on growth.
   - Consider holding lower-risk investments or those that generate taxable income (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - The closer you are to retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments, particularly in your 401(k) and IRA.

4. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds to minimize taxes in retirement, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first if needed.

A common approach is to max out contributions to your 401(k) first, then fund an IRA, leaving taxable accounts for additional savings. Adjust based on personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Consulting a financial advisor may provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
