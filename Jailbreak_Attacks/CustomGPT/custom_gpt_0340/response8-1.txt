Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the 401(k) to maximize the match. Consider the overall fees and investment options.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for money you'll need before retirement. These accounts offer more accessible funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Taxes are deferred until withdrawal (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of investments across accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
