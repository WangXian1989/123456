Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and should be your initial priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, you may be eligible for tax-deductible contributions to a Traditional IRA or tax-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA. Consider contributing to an IRA up to the maximum limit after taking full advantage of your 401(k) match.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) if you can. Consider contributing more if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments if you want more flexibility or if you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts. This allows for access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Asset Location**: Consider what investments to put in which accounts. Stocks (which have the potential for long-term capital gains) might be better suited for taxable accounts, while bonds (which generate interest taxable as ordinary income) could be more advantageous in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy based on your unique circumstances and goals.
