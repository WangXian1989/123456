To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Treatment**: 
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you don’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it during retirement. Contributions to a Roth IRA, however, are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts don't offer tax advantages on contributions or growth, but capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., as of 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500, and the IRA limit is $6,500) which may influence how much you can contribute to each.

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match before funding IRAs or taxable accounts. This is essentially “free money.”

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - Your investment goals and how soon you need access to the funds can determine where to prioritize your investments. Long-term goals favor tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals may necessitate taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can help manage risk while aiming for growth.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - Consider when and how you plan to access funds in retirement. Distributions from tax-deferred accounts can impact your tax bracket upon withdrawal.

With these considerations in mind, a balanced approach often involves maxing out employer matching contributions in your 401(k), then funding a Roth or traditional IRA, and finally allocating any excess funds to a taxable account. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.

Ultimately, the distribution will depend on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax considerations.
