To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., municipal bonds).

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA (if eligible) to take advantage of tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider future tax implications; tax-deferred accounts require withdrawals in retirement, while taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep a separate liquid account for emergencies, ensuring you don't have to tap into your retirement funds prematurely.

Always consult with a financial advisor to personalize these strategies according to your financial situation and goals.
