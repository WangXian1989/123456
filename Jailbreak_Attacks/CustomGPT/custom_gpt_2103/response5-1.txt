Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you expect to need the funds. Here are some important considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax situation and your expectations for the future, one may be more beneficial than the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, you can consider taxable accounts. These can provide more liquidity and flexibility in accessing your funds, though you will owe taxes on any capital gains and dividends earned.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Consider the tax implications of investments in taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts. For example, consider holding stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates, and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: Your time horizon plays a significant role in distribution strategy. If you're younger and many years from retirement, you might prioritize higher-risk investments in your 401(k) and IRA. If you're nearing retirement, prioritize preserving capital.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs and to account for any changes in tax laws or personal circumstances.
