Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guide to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: This is a great option for retirement savings, especially if your employer matches contributions. Consider maxing it out if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement; a Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction on contributions.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Choose Traditional accounts if you want immediate tax benefits, but be aware of taxes upon withdrawal.
   - Use Roth accounts for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've funded your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. They offer flexibility and can be a good source for short-term savings or investments that may generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. Ensure that investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Continuous Review**: Regularly review your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, and life events. Adjust your contributions and investment strategy as necessary.

In conclusion, a balanced approach focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged options first, followed by taxable accounts, will generally serve you well. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.
