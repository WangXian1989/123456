Question: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Answer: To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA if eligible; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth investments, like stocks, because they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Keep more liquid, easily accessible investments in your taxable account, such as cash equivalents (e.g., money market funds or short-term bonds). 

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Distribute more equity investments within tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term nature, while keeping fixed-income investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan on withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) last in retirement to allow for tax-free growth for as long as possible. 

Consider your overall financial situation, including tax bracket, financial goals, and retirement timeline, to tailor these strategies effectively. Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions. --
