Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here's a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If you can, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) after maximizing your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** After funding your IRA, consider maximizing your contributions to the 401(k) plan, particularly if you’re in a higher tax bracket. The contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Investments:** Once you’ve contributed to your retirement accounts, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can help minimize your tax burden in taxable accounts. 

6. **Diversification:** Ensure you’re diversifying your investments across all accounts to minimize risk. This applies to asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) as well as geographical diversification.

7. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best suits your individual circumstances.
