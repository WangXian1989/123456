The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** The 401(k) has higher contribution limits than IRAs, so maximize contributions if feasible.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Consider Tax Implications:** If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you expect your rate to be higher, a Roth IRA could be better, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification:** If you are maxing out your 401(k) and have additional funds, consider contributing to an IRA to diversify your tax exposure.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use this account for funds that you may need before retirement, as it can provide more flexible access without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Look into tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-free municipal bonds, to minimize your tax liability on gains.

4. **General Tips:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Review your overall asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Check your investments periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired allocation.
   - **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal finance is complex, and a professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Remember, individual circumstances vary, so it's crucial to consider your unique financial situations when making these decisions.
