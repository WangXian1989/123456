Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides potential tax deductions now.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve contributed to your IRA, continue to make contributions to your 401(k), aiming to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility but come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) and be mindful of the tax impact when buying/selling investments.

6. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your investment distribution and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and goals.
