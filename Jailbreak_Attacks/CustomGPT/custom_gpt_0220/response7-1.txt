It's important to consider several factors when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: Begin by contributing enough to max out any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. Then, assess your investment options within the plan; typically, target-date funds or diversified index funds are good choices for long-term growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it a great option for younger investors. If you're eligible for tax deductions, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial as well, especially in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investments once you max out retirement accounts. This space can provide flexibility and liquidity. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as ETFs or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing excessively in these accounts. A typical recommendation is to have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved.

5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Allocate funds based on your financial goals and how soon you need access to that money. Longer-term accounts can afford to take on more risk than taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: A personalized assessment of your situation can optimize your investment strategy based on your income, risk tolerance, and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on personal financial circumstances and future goals. Always consider reviewing your strategy periodically as your situation changes.
