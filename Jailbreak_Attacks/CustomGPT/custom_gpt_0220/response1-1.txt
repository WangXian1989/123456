When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer matching, if available. This account offers tax-deferred growth and reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA next, considering the tax advantages. A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

**Key Considerations**:
- **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type to optimize growth.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your investment choices with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in any of these accounts.

It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
