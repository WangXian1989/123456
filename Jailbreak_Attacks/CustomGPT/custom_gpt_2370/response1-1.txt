Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable account can seem daunting, but with some strategic planning, you can optimize your savings for retirement. Here’s a clear guide on how to approach this:

### Understand the Different Accounts

**1. 401(k):**  
This employer-sponsored retirement plan allows you to save for retirement with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income. Your employer might even match contributions, which is essentially free money. 

**2. IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**  
IRAs come in two types: Traditional and Roth. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs enable tax-free withdrawals during retirement. Consider your tax situation when choosing between the two.

**3. Taxable Accounts:**  
These are standard brokerage accounts that don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer you flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties.

### Strategy for Distribution

**Step 1: Max out your 401(k)**  
If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this account first. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match—it’s one of the best investment returns you can get.

**Step 2: Contribute to an IRA**  
After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your tax situation, you may want a Traditional or Roth IRA. 

**Step 3: Back to the 401(k)**  
Once your IRA contributions are maxed out (for 2023, contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs – with catch-up contributions allowed if you're over 50), consider contributing more to your 401(k) until you hit the annual contribution limit.

**Step 4: Invest in Taxable Accounts**  
After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into a taxable account. This is useful for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to the funds before retirement.

### Consider Your Goals and Risk Tolerance

Each person's financial situation is different. Your age, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance all play crucial roles in how you allocate your investments. Here are some questions to reflect on:

- **What are your short-term versus long-term financial goals?**
- **How comfortable are you with market fluctuations and investment risks?**
- **Do you foresee needing access to your funds before retirement?**

### Conclusion

Properly distributing your money across these accounts can significantly impact your financial future. By maximizing employer matches, exploring tax advantages, and strategizing your investments, you can set yourself up for a secure retirement.

### Next Steps and Considerations

To enhance your strategy, it may be worth consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially as laws and limits can change.
