Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Next, fund an IRA (either Traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Only contribute here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Consider holding bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
