To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA. Traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversification**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, while placing higher-growth potential assets in tax-deferred accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As retirement approaches, consider a withdrawal strategy that optimizes tax efficiencyâ€”drawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
