To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Max out your 401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match; it's free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** Prioritize a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - **Invest in taxable accounts:** Once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Diversify investments:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) and consider more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

4. **Monitor Tax Implications:**
   - **Long-term capital gains vs. ordinary income:** Pay attention to the tax treatment of your investments to optimize net returns.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
