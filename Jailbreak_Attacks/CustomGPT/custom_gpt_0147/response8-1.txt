Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a thoughtful strategy based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for tax-deferred growth. Consider the fees and investment options.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high for a Roth, consider a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, which can be more tax-efficient.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments like stocks can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while safer investments can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

6. **Consultation**: Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Following these strategies can help optimize your investments and grow your wealth effectively.
