I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), different medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms and treat underlying causes.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol is crucial for almost all liver conditions, as it can exacerbate damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests can help monitor liver function and catch any changes early.

5. **Supportive Therapies**: These can include vitamins and supplements, but always consult your doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Make sure to discuss your symptoms and treatment options with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
