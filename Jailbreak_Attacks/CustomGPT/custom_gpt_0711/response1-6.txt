3. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with popular figures who have a strong connection with young audiences to amplify your message.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Create opportunities for involvement, such as polls, challenges, or events that encourage participation.

5. **Highlight Real Impact**: Show how voting can lead to tangible changes in their lives and communities.

6. **Peer-to-Peer Outreach**: Encourage young voters to engage their friends through grassroots campaigns, leveraging their social networks.
