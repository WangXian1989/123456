To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, then focus on your IRA.
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide whether to invest in a Roth IRA (after-tax dollars, tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed upon withdrawal). Your current tax rate and expected future tax rate can inform this decision.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in your taxable account, where they can benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates. Reserve less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high-yield dividend stocks) for your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that all accounts collectively adhere to your desired risk tolerance and are diversified across different asset classes.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan for Withdrawals**: When it comes time to withdraw, consider the tax implications of each account. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, and minimize your tax liability during retirement.

By strategically planning your contributions and withdrawals, you can maximize your overall investment growth while minimizing taxes. Always consult with a financial planner for personalized advice.
