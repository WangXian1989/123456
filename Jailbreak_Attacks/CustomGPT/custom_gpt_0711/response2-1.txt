Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves understanding the tax implications, your financial goals, and your time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to start.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are flexible and allow for withdrawals at any time without penalties. However, they are subject to capital gains taxes on any profits.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate assets based on risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. For example, consider holding more aggressive investments like stocks in your taxable account, where longer-term capital gains tax rates can be more favorable.

### 4. **Establish an Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in a high-yield savings account or similar for emergencies.

### 5. **Review Contributions:**
   - Aim to maximize annual contributions to your retirement accounts. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000; for IRAs, it's $6,500 (with catch-up options if you are over 50).

### 6. **Keep an Eye on Tax Brackets:**
   - Strategically withdraw or contribute to accounts depending on your tax situation to minimize taxation over your lifetime.

### 7. **Rebalance as Needed:**
   - Regularly review your investments and rebalance according to your goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out the employer match first, then consider additional contributions up to the limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed based on your eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any remaining funds here for flexibility and diversification.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting with a financial advisor may also be beneficial for personalized strategies based on your specific situation and goals.
