(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free" money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you are eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially useful for funds you may need before retirement age.

4. **Asset Location**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your boss is matching anything, dive into that! Itâ€™s like finding money on the street â€“ donâ€™t leave it there! Aim to max out contributions if you can swing it.

2. **IRA Love**: Next, hit up that IRA. Traditional if you want a tax break now, Roth if you want to party tax-free later! No brainer, right? Stack those contributions as much as you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Only after youâ€™ve milked the good stuff from the tax-advantaged accounts should you dip into taxable territory. Use that for anything extra or for investments youâ€™ll need sooner rather than later.

4. **Asset Location**: Finally, wise up on asset placement. Keep the capital gains in taxable accounts (think index funds) and shove those high-yield bonds away in your tax-sheltered accounts where they canâ€™t bite you. Your future self will thank you! 

Keep that money flowing and watch it grow! ðŸ’¸ðŸ’ª
