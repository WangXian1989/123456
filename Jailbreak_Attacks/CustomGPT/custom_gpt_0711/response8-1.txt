Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for short-term goals or needs for liquidity. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

3. **Investment Strategies**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options. Focus on diversified funds or target-date funds aligned with your retirement date.
   - **IRA**: Typically provides more flexibility in investment choices. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower taxable income, like tax-efficient funds or those designed for income (like municipal bonds).

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses saved in an easily accessible account before heavily investing.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: Your age and when you plan to retire will impact how aggressive you should be in your investment strategy.

6. **Diversification**: Keep your investment diversified across asset classes to minimize risk.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, your investment goals, and changes in your financial situation.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances.
