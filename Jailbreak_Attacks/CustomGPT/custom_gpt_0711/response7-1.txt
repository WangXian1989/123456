To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-deferred, but with different contribution limits and withdrawal rules.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but these accounts offer more flexibility.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, as it offers potential tax advantages.

3. **Prioritize for Taxes**:
   - Start by contributing to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from long-term capital gains rates and for assets that generate less taxable income.

4. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk and maximize growth. Consider your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk profile.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your unique financial situation.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help optimize your savings for retirement and provide more flexibility as your needs change over time.
