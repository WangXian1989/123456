To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on filling tax-advantaged accounts next. 
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the maximum limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2024).
   - **IRA:** Next, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** 
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA:** Contributions lower your taxable income now, but distributions are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions don’t reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that can benefit from long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Equities generally offer higher returns over time but come with higher volatility. Bonds can offer stability but with lower returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically assess your allocations to ensure they align with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor, especially to optimize for your tax situation based on your individual financial goals.

This approach helps balance the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts while allowing for liquidity and flexibility with taxable accounts.
