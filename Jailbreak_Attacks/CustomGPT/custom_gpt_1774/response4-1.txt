Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is an essential part of personal finance strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maximizing retirement contributions.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. The Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

4. **Continue with 401(k)**: After fully funding your IRA, go back to your 401(k) to increase contributions, especially if you're trying to reach annual contribution limits.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds, consider investing in a taxable account for flexibility. This can be useful for medium-term goals, as withdrawals can be made without penalties (but may incur taxes).

6. **Asset Allocation**: Think about what you’re investing in each account. Generally, it's wise to hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) because they benefit more from tax-deferred or tax-free growth. More stable investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact on interest income.

7. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Evaluate your current tax bracket and anticipated future income. This helps illustrate the benefits of Roth accounts versus traditional accounts.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

It's always best to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
