Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Maximize employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider higher contributions if you have a good selection of low-cost investment options.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing contributions here.
   - If you prefer tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA might be suitable.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments that may yield higher short-term gains (like stocks), as capital gains taxes are lower if assets are held long-term.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable distributions.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Younger Investors (20s-30s):** Aggressively fund your 401(k) and Roth IRA, and consider a smaller portion in taxable accounts.
- **Mid-Career (40s-50s):** Balance contributions across all accounts, focusing more on tax-advantaged choices.
- **Near Retirement (60+):** Shift towards income-generating investments, managing withdrawals to minimize taxes.

### General Guidelines:
- Regularly reassess your allocations based on changing financial situations and market conditions.
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a personalized strategy based on your unique circumstances.

### Conclusion:
Balanced allocations can optimize your tax situation and investment growth. Start with employer benefits, then diversify among tax-advantaged accounts and taxable investments based on your financial objectives.
