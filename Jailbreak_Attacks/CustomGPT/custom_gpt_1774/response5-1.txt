The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a breakdown of each account type and a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Benefits**: Employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth.
- **Strategy**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially “free money.” After that, increase contributions if you can, especially if your plan has low fees and a good selection of investments.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**
- **Benefits**: Tax advantages (deductible contributions for Traditional; tax-free withdrawals for Roth).
- **Strategy**: If your income is below certain thresholds, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize a Traditional IRA. Max out contributions (currently $6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for 50+) if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Benefits**: Flexibility in withdrawals, no contribution limits.
- **Strategy**: Use these for investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds or qualified dividends). This can be a place for short-term goals or more liquid needs.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize Contributions**: Make sure you’re maximizing your contributions to the 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
3. **Diversify**: Ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. 

### **Annual Review**
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
