Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** 
     - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
     - Maximize your contributions if you're able. The limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** 
     - After maximizing your 401(k), consider making contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
     - Choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your current tax bracket.

### 2. **Understand Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** 
     - Use these for investments that may produce taxable income, like stocks that pay dividends or bonds.
     - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts to minimize tax implications.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place, ideally 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account.
   - If you have shorter-term goals (e.g., saving for a house), consider keeping those funds in liquid, low-risk investments.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments within each account category to manage risk.
   - Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate).

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Adjust your contributions and allocations accordingly.

### 6. **Long-Term Considerations**
   - If you're closer to retirement, shift toward more conservative investments in all accounts.
   - Take advantage of catch-up contributions if youâ€™re 50 or older.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help create a tailored strategy based on your specific situation.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money while maximizing growth and minimizing tax implications.
