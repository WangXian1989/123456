Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income, investment goals, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Consider making pre-tax contributions, lowering your taxable income.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose investments that align with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Traditional IRAs provide current tax deductions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs for investments that may be less tax-efficient if held in a taxable account.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use this for short-term goals, as you can access your money without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Dividend Consideration**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and interest earned, as these are taxed yearly.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set up before heavily investing.
- **Age-Based Allocation**: As a general rule, the younger you are, the more you can risk in stocks within your retirement accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your investment distribution and make adjustments as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.
