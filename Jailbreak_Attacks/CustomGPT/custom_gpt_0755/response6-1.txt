Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might follow:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Full Contributions**: Consider maximizing your contributions to the IRAs (both Traditional and Roth) if you qualify based on income limits.

### 2. Assess Contributions Based on Tax Implications
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but taxes will be owed upon withdrawal during retirement. Good for higher income brackets.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth contributions for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Account**: Ideal for funds you may need before retirement or for specific goals (e.g., buying a house). Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments in this account.

### 3. Diversify Investments Within Accounts
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and age.
   - **IRA**: Consider alternative investments, like real estate or commodities, in addition to traditional stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Account**: Use tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Balanced Withdrawal Strategy Later
   - Develop a strategy for when you start withdrawing funds, considering tax implications (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first may reduce tax burdens).

### Conclusion
Your ideal distribution depends on personal financial situations and goals, but utilizing the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining liquidity through taxable accounts is critical for efficient wealth building. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance suited to your unique circumstances.
