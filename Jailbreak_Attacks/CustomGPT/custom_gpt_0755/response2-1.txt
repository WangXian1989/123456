Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, maximize your contributions to take advantage of the tax benefits and potential compound growth. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. The 2023 contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). A Roth IRA is generally preferable if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional accounts offer immediate tax benefits, deferring taxes until withdrawal. Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing traditional accounts might be more beneficial.
   - For taxable accounts, consider capital gains implications and how frequently you might want to access these funds.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Based on your risk tolerance, allocate your investments accordingly in each account. For example, you might choose a more aggressive allocation in your 401(k) and IRA, especially since those funds will be for long-term growth, while opting for more stable investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a savings account or other liquid assets. This fund should be separate from your investment accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Adjust your contributions if necessary.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - If your financial situation is complex, consider speaking with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy should align with your financial goals, timelines, and personal circumstances.
