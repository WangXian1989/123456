Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize retirement accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s for their tax benefits:
     - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
     - **Roth IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need before retirement or for flexible investing. They don't have the same tax advantages but might allow for capital gains treatment on investments held long-term.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a diversified mix across all accounts, considering assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Think about stocks, bonds, and other investments.

### 4. **Emergency Savings**
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

### 5. **Long-Term Strategy**
   - Review your investment strategy regularly, adjusting allocations based on changing circumstances or goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your income (enough to get the match)
- **Roth IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (currently $6,500 annually; $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings or investments once retirement accounts are maxed out

### Conclusion
Consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.
