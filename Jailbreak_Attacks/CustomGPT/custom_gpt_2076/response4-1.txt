Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers employer matching contributions, potential tax benefits, and higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth), with lower contribution limits than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, flexible withdrawals, but investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - For 2024, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're 50 or older). The limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. This balances risk and potential returns.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, contributing more to tax-deferred accounts can offer immediate tax relief. If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, consider Roth accounts.

7. **Adjust According to Your Life Stage**:
   - Younger investors might focus on growth (higher risk), while closer to retirement, the priority may shift to preserving capital.

8. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

A tailored plan considering your specific circumstances is advisable, and consulting a financial advisor can provide additional clarity.
