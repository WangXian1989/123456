Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to maximize contributions up to the annual limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After the 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Choose a Traditional IRA if you want immediate tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assessing Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for funds you may need before retirement. Keep in mind that any growth will be taxed as capital gains. Use these accounts for investments that pay qualified dividends and long-term growth, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals:**
   - If you need flexibility and may withdraw funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts.
   - For long-term growth, focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider different asset allocations that align with your risk tolerance in each account.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changing financial goals, or life circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and help optimize your contributions and allocations.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money to take full advantage of tax benefits while meeting your financial goals.
