To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growing investments (like stocks) since they grow tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth accounts).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments like bonds or high-dividend stocks that generate taxable income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a diverse mix of asset classes in all accounts, but adjust based on account type; for example, consider keeping more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, prioritizing tax-efficient withdrawals (e.g., tapping taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer).

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your unique financial situation, it may be helpful to consult a professional.

By strategically balancing your contributions and investments across these three types of accounts, you can optimize your tax impact and growth potential over time.
