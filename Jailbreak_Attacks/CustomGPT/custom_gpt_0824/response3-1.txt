Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds for immediate expenses in taxable accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute enough to get the employer match if available.
     - Consider maxing out this account first for tax-deferred growth.

   - **IRA**:
     - Contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (income limits apply).
     - Aim for the maximum contribution annually if possible.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for more flexible investment choices.
     - Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.
   - Each account type may have different investment options; tailor your investments according to your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider professional advice to tailor a strategy based on your unique financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then max it out.
- **Roth IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional funds while considering your liquidity needs.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first, you can enhance your retirement savings effectively while still addressing liquidity and risk factors in your taxable accounts.
