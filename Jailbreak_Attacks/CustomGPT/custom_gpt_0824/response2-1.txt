To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Often comes with tax advantages; investments grow tax-deferred. Focus on higher-growth assets here.
   - **IRA**: Use for taxable investments if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for flexibility; focus on investments that have favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains).

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

5. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - Match accounts with your short-term and long-term financial goals. For instance, savings needed soon should be in more liquid, accessible accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best allocation for your specific situation, consider seeking professional guidance.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
