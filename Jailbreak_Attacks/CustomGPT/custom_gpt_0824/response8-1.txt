Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2024, itâ€™s up to $23,000 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions available for those over 50.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - Consider the tax implications of withdrawals. Funds in your 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free if certain conditions are met.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Keep sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, ensuring you have quick access to funds without penalties.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjust**
   - Continuously monitor your investment performance and rebalance your portfolio as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, then contribute to IRAs for additional tax benefits. Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Consult with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
