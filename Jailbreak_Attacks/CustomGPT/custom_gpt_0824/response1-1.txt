Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions upfront.
   - Determine which is better for you based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties. Consider this for additional investments or for short-term goals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - Keep investments with less growth potential (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:** Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This balanced approach can optimize your savings while considering tax impacts.
