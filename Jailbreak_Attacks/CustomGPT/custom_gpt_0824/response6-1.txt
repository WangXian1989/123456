Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this to take full advantage of "free money."
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Contributions to 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider placing investments with high potential for short-term capital gains (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Consider Investment Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds needed within the next few years to maintain flexibility.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals in all three account types.
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for a more aggressive growth strategy, while keeping less volatile investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocation annually to respond to changes in market conditions, taxes, and your financial situation.

By adopting a strategic approach and regularly reviewing your allocations, youâ€™ll optimize your investments for growth while managing tax implications.
