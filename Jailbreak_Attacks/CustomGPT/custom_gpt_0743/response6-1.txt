To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA to take full advantage of tax deductions and potential employer matching contributions (if available).
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

2. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to minimize risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering changes in market conditions and personal finance goals.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: Strategize how you will draw funds in retirement. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

By employing these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money to maximize growth while minimizing tax implications.
