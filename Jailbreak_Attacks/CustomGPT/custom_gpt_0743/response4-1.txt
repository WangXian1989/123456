When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you’ll want to take into account several factors including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions might be tax-deductible, and taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if rules are followed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized, so the investment strategy here can have immediate tax implications.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate funds across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. You may want to consider different investment strategies for each account type:
   - Long-term growth investments can be suitable for tax-advantaged retirement accounts.
   - Short-term investments and cash equivalents might be better suited for taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Assess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary based on market conditions and changes in your risk tolerance.

5. **Funding Order**: Some financial advisors suggest a funding order such as:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) up to the match.
   - Fund your Roth IRA if eligible.
   - Continue to contribute to your 401(k) or traditional IRA.
   - Allocate any additional funds into a taxable investment account after maximizing tax-advantaged options.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so consider these guidelines as a starting point. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
