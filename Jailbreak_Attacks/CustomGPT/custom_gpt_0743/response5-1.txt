(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially "free money." Additionally, you may want to max out your IRA contributions, as these accounts can provide tax advantages either now or in retirement. Once you've maximized these tax-advantaged options, consider investing in your taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.
