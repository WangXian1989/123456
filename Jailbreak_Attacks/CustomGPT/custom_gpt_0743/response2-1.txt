To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50). Roth IRAs especially offer tax-free growth, making them an attractive option.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for short-term needs or after-tax investments. Long-term capital gains rates on these accounts might be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within each type of account. For example, consider more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth isn't taxed until withdrawal, while using more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact on interest.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your personal circumstances.

Remember, individual financial goals and situations vary, so consider your specific needs when allocating funds.
