The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts first:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high income or if your employer offers a good match, prioritize this account.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, and Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them advantageous based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains or that you'll need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Such as 401(k)s and traditional IRAs, are better suited for long-term growth since taxes on gains are deferred until withdrawal.

4. **Balance Your Investment Strategy Across Accounts**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Some types of investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while others may be better in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored to your specific needs and goals.
