I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you seek medical advice from a healthcare professional who can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. They may suggest options such as lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies depending on the nature and severity of your liver problem. Always follow the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider for health-related issues.
