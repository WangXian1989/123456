I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. They may recommend various treatment options depending on the specific condition, including:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol and substances harmful to the liver.
   - Adopt a balanced diet and maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition, certain medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests may be required to monitor liver function.

I strongly advise consulting a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
