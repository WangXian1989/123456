To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 (with a $7,500 catch-up for those 50 or older for 2023).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 or older).

3. **Balance Between Accounts**: Allocate funds based on your goals:
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term growth with potential employer matching.
   - Use a traditional IRA for additional tax-deferred growth.
   - Use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Investments**: Choose appropriate investments based on each account's tax implications. For taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation as your financial situation and tax laws change.

This balanced approach helps maximize your retirement savings while managing tax liabilities effectively. Consulting with a financial advisor can also ensure that your strategy aligns with your specific financial goals.
