Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a good choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and contributing to IRAs, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you're in a low tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you're contributing adequately to tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for additional investments. This provides flexibility for short-term goals without penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
