To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Once youâ€™ve maximized any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments you want to access before retirement age or investments that may benefit from long-term capital gains rates.
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing your Roth options (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) as you will pay taxes on contributions now, which can be advantageous when you withdraw during retirement.

3. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Ensure that the investments within these accounts are diversified. A balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage risk. You might choose to hold more aggressive or higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications on interest and dividends.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan ahead for when you will begin withdrawal. You may want to prioritize which accounts to withdraw from in retirement based on your tax situation at that time.

5. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - As your financial situation changes (e.g., income changes, tax laws changing, retirement goals), reevaluate your strategy to ensure it aligns with your current circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial goals and tax situation.
