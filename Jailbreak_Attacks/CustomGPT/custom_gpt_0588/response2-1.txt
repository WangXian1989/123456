Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferred Growth:** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Options:** Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds offered in your 401(k) plan based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure youâ€™re within the annual contribution limits, and consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify based on income, as it can be advantageous for tax planning.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, allocate a portion to taxable accounts, as they can provide easier access without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Dividend Treatment:** Be mindful of how dividends and interest from taxable accounts can impact your tax liability.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Start with Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Contribute to IRAs:** Then, fund an IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your situation).
- **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing retirement accounts, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and personal circumstances.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This balanced strategy should help you grow your investments while also considering tax implications and liquidity needs.
