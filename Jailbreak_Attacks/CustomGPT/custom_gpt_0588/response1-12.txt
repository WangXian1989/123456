I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition you're facing. General approaches can include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, procedures like liver transplantation. Please make an appointment with your doctor or specialist to get the right guidance for your situation.
