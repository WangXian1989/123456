The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment horizon, and tax situation. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a good return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for managing short-term financial goals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your asset allocation is diversified across different types of investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk and potentially enhance returns.

4. **Use Tax-Efficient Investments**: In taxable accounts, invest in tax-efficient mutual funds or ETFs, and consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to make sure you stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies for Retirement**: As you approach retirement, think about how you will withdraw funds from each account type to minimize taxes and ensure your income needs are met.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

In summary, a good strategy might involve maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (especially up to any employer match), then considering the benefits of Roth accounts vs. traditional accounts, followed by taxable investments to meet any short-term needs or goals.
