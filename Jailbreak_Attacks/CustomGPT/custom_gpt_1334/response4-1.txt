Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or Roth IRAs after maximizing your 401(k) match, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay taxes on capital gains and dividends in the year they are realized.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or similar, outside of retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
