To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if availableâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), influencing your current tax situation.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to both traditional and Roth IRAs. This provides tax benefits both now and in retirement.
   - **Limitations**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts give you easy access to your money without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in low-turnover funds or tax-efficient stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, then max out your IRA contributions next.
- **Fill Up Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maxing out the IRA, return to the 401(k) to further contribute if possible, especially if it has good investment options and low fees.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Extra Savings**: For additional savings or investments beyond your tax-advantaged accounts, put your money in taxable accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investments based on your comfort level with risk.
- **Time Horizon**: The longer you have until retirement, the more you can afford to take risks.
- **Tax Impact**: Be mindful of how withdrawal strategies will affect your tax situation in retirement.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly reassess your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and investment options change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.
