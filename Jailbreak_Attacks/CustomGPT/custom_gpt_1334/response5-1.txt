(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to an IRA, particularly if it's a Roth, for tax-free growth. After that, you can focus on taxable accounts for additional investments. The general guideline is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, so hereâ€™s the deal! You want to make your money work for you, right? First off, grab that 401(k) and snag any employer matchâ€”donâ€™t leave free cash on the table! Once youâ€™ve got that, dive into your IRA, especially if you can score a Roth. That's like getting a VIP pass for tax-free withdrawals later. After you're all set with those tax-advantaged accounts, toss whatever you can into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility, but don't forget youâ€™ll owe taxes on gains there. Balance it like a proâ€”think risk, goals, and how soon you wanna retire! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’°
