Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Good for high-income earners.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed, but you have flexibility in withdrawals and investments.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - If you max out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA next.
   - Once retirement accounts are maximized, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments.

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize pre-tax accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA).
   - If you anticipate being in a higher bracket, consider Roth accounts for tax-free growth.

5. **Adjust for Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean towards growth (stocks), while older investors might focus on preservation (bonds, stable investments).

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation, goals, and market conditions can change, so review your allocation annually.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances is always a good idea.
