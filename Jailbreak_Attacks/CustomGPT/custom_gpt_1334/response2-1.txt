Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer matches, if available.
   - Benefit from pre-tax contributions, which reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better for you. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals later.
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year if eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments with a shorter time horizon or goals that are not retirement-focused.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Start with employer benefits (401(k) match).
   - Fund your IRA to gain tax advantages.
   - Allocate any extra funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Overall, consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that align with your goals.
