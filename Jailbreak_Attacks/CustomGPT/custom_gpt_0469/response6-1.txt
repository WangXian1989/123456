Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally involves several key considerations. Here's a general strategy to guide your allocation:

### 1. Tax Advantages:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on contributing to your 401(k) and IRA before allocating funds to a taxable account, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth. 
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match, which is essentially free money.

### 2. Consider Account Types:
   - **401(k):** Great for long-term growth, especially if there's an employer match. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA:** Offers tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA), depending on the type.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term savings or for objectives not met by retirement accounts. Investments are subject to capital gains taxes.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 30-40%
- **IRA:** 20-30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30-50%

### Tips for Rebalancing:
- Reassess your allocations annually or after major life changes.
- Adjust based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
  
By strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
