The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which means they can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) for contributions and withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains tax but offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a liquid savings account.

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit card debt), it may make sense to pay that off before investing heavily.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Across all accounts, make sure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. You may want a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Optimize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s, IRAs) to defer taxes.
   - Consider placing bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts, where their tax treatment can be more favorable.

7. **Review Annually**: Your financial situation and market conditions will change, so review and adjust your distribution annually.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, it could be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your individual needs.

Ultimately, the right mix depends on your unique circumstances, so tailor your approach as needed.
