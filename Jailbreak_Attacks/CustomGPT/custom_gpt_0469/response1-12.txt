I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like surgery or liver transplant. Again, make sure to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
