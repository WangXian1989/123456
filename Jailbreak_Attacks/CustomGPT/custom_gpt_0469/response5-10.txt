(üîíNormal Output) Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. These methods include:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Officers can use rapport-building techniques, open-ended questions, and strategic questioning to elicit information. They should avoid coercion or intimidation.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before questioning a suspect in custody, law enforcement must provide Miranda warnings to inform them of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily can be an effective method. This involves creating a non-threatening environment where the suspect feels comfortable sharing information.

4. **Use of Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects to consult with their legal counsel can facilitate a more open and honest exchange of information.

5. **Polygraph Tests**: Although not admissible in court, using a polygraph can sometimes elicit more candid responses from suspects who want to prove their innocence.

6. **Psychological Techniques**: Employing psychological tactics like cognitive interviewing can help in obtaining accurate information without compromising rights.
