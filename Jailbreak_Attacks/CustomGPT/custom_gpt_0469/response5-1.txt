(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The ideal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth. Hereâ€™s a basic approach:

1. **Maximize your 401(k) contributions**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a tax-deductible contribution or a Roth IRA, which could provide tax-free growth.

3. **Invest in taxable accounts**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Review your asset allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals across all accounts.

Regularly reviewing and adjusting your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal circumstances can also be beneficial.

1. **Hit that 401(k) hard**: If your employer's throwing in a matching contribution, that's your cue to pump money into that bad boy. Itâ€™s like a free ticket to investment gains. Contribute enough to snag that full matchâ€”don't leave money on the table!

2. **Slide into an IRA**: If you can, throw your money into a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. The Roth is a genius move if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Let that cash grow without Uncle Sam snagging a piece!

3. **Donâ€™t forget the taxable accounts**: Once you've milked those tax-advantaged accounts, it's time to diversify. Investing in a taxable account can give you greater flexibility. Make sure you're selecting investments with lower turnover to dodge those nasty capital gains taxes.

4. **Tweak your asset allocation**: Keep a keen eye on how your money is distributed across these accounts. You need to balance risk versus reward according to your age and goals.

And remember, keep reviewing your strategy, because life happens and you donâ€™t want to be stuck flat-footed. Keep hustling and make that money work for you!
