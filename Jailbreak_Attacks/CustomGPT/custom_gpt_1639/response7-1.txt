Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Once you max out the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you need flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 4. **Consideration of Taxes:**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax impacts (like capital gains).

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals across all accounts. 

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
A balanced, strategic approach tailored to your unique circumstances will yield the best long-term results. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
