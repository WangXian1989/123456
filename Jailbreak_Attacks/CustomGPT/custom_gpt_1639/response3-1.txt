Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially "free money."

2. **Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: Next, consider funding an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now but taxes withdrawals later. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **401(k) Additional Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) if you still have room—consider the tax-deferred growth benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons might favor more aggressive investments in retirement accounts, while shorter goals might be better suited for safer investments in taxable accounts.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your specific circumstances.
