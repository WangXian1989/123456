Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep investments that generate capital gains or interest in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Align with Your Goals**
   - For short-term needs, use taxable accounts for quicker access without penalties.
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts since they offer compounding benefits.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Re-evaluate Annually**
   - Regularly assess and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can tailor a strategy to your specific situation, considering current tax laws and individual circumstances.

By taking these steps, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across these accounts.
