Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for the tax deduction.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After employer matching, if possible, contribute to your 401(k) to maximize tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals outside retirement, since they offer flexibility for withdrawals. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments in each account reflect your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider asset allocation strategies.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA and taxable account withdrawals can have different tax implications.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
