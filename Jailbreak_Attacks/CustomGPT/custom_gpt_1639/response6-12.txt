I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Medications**: 
   - **Antivirals** for hepatitis.
   - **Steroids** for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet modification**: Low-fat, high-fiber diet; avoid alcohol.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Frequent check-ups and liver function tests to monitor health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, options may include liver transplant or procedures to reduce pressure in the portal vein.

Always consult a liver specialist for a thorough evaluation and tailored treatment plan.
