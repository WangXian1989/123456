To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This provides liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of tax implications for withdrawals in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Review Annually**: Revisit your allocation regularly based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your asset distribution for retirement and financial growth.
