Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Focus on pre-tax contributions to lower your taxable income today.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Balance contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes (like index funds).

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more toward growth, while those closer to retirement should consider more conservative investments.
- **Regular Review**: Adjust allocations periodically based on performance and changing life circumstances.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
