To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold lower-growth, tax-efficient assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Place higher-growth, more volatile investments (like equities) in tax-advantaged accounts to leverage tax deferral or elimination.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan for Tax Diversification**: In retirement, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then 401(k), and lastly IRA accounts to manage tax implications effectively.

### 4. **Regular Review**
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation annually to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Implementing these strategies can lead to effective wealth accumulation while minimizing tax liabilities.
