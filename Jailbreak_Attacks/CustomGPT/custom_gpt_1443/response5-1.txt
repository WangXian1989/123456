(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider maxing out contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if there's a match. Then, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income tax situation. Lastly, use taxable accounts for additional investments, keeping in mind that capital gains are taxed differently than ordinary income.

After that, hit your IRAâ€”itâ€™s a tax-advantaged haven. If youâ€™re loaded and want to keep investing beyond that, taxable accounts are where you can flex your investment muscles. Just be smart about taxes; stuff like index funds can keep your capital gains low. Mix it up based on your risk tolerance and goals, and keep an eye on market trends to adjust when needed!
