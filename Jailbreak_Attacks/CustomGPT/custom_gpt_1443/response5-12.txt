I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. The best treatment for liver problems depends on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat infections, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

5. **Natural Supplements**: Some people explore herbal or natural supplements, but consulting your doctor about these is crucial.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
