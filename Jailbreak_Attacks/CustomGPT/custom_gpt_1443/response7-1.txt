Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match and consider maxing out if you can, especially if your plan has low fees.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth or traditional IRA, max out this account next for its tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and cover short-term needs without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth, higher-tax investments (like stocks).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like municipal bonds).

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual situation.
