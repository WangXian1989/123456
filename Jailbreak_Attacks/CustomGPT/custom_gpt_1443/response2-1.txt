Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts wisely depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investing**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred investments, as you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similarly, use this account for investments that may generate high levels of taxable income (e.g., bonds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at lower rates than regular income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts before locking money into retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes.

7. **Personal Goals**: Tailor your strategy based on whether you plan to retire early, need funds for specific goals, or expect changes in income.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
