I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consider the following treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Viral Hepatitis Treatment**: If you have hepatitis, antiviral medications may be recommended.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver is damaged beyond repair, a transplant may be necessary.

6. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people find benefit in supplements like milk thistle, but always consult your doctor before starting any new treatment.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and an appropriate treatment plan.
