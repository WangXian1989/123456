Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA next. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice depends on your current tax rate versus your expected rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), look into taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

4. **Asset Location**: 
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) are better in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds) can be held in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Monitor your investments and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider working with a financial advisor.

This strategy will help balance growth potential with tax efficiency over time.
