Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timelines. Here's a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you want tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are best for money you might need in the short to medium term since they donâ€™t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

2. **Consider Investment Strategies**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim for a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance, usually involving a mix of stocks, bonds, and potentially target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar investment strategies apply, but you might want to focus on long-term growth since penalties apply for early withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investment strategies, like index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**: Revisit your allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, especially as market conditions change.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This strategy can help optimize your investments and tax implications over time.
