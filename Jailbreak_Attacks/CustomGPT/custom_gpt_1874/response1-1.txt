Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. It’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: If you're under 50, you can contribute up to $22,500 in 2023 (and $30,000 if over 50). Contribute to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Depending on your tax situation:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, but withdrawals are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 in 2023 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow easier access to funds without penalties, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments that generate less taxable income here (like index funds or ETFs).

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have some liquid savings for emergencies before maxing out retirement accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Across asset classes (stocks, bonds) and sectors for risk management.
- **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, or retirement goals.

Consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal needs.
