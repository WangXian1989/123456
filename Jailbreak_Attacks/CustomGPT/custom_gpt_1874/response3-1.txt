Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your tax bracket is high, the pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Know the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Understand how withdrawals from each account type will affect your tax bracket in retirement. Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility with capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Keep a mix of investments in each account type to diversify your risk. Consider asset allocation strategies based on your risk tolerance and age.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can take a comprehensive look at your situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to fund your retirement and financial goals.
