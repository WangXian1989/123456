   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid retention in cases such as cirrhosis.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and detect any progression of liver disease.

4. **Procedures/Surgery**: In cases of severe liver disease, procedures such as:
   - **Liver Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease when the liver cannot function.
   - **Endoscopic procedures**: To manage complications like variceal bleeding.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal remedies or supplements, but it's crucial to discuss these with a doctor, as they can interact with regular treatments.
