(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A general guideline is:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This provides tax-deferred growth and potential free money.
  
2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you meet the income limits, as this allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for money you may need before retirement. Invest in tax-efficient vehicles like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for a strategy tailored to your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Okay, letâ€™s break it down! To maximize your financial game, think of your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a triathlonâ€”you want to balance them for strength, speed, and agility.

1. **401(k):** Go hard here first! If your employer has a match, itâ€™s free moneyâ€”like finding cash in your couch. Aim to maximize your contributions, especially in those early years when compound interest can kick in like a turbo boost.

2. **IRA:** Next up, a Roth IRA is your buddy if you expect higher taxes later. Sure, you pay taxes now, but it grows tax-free for the long haul. A traditional IRA is also solid if you think your tax bracket will drop in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for flexibility! These bad boys allow you earlier access to your cash without penalties. Invest in low-turnover funds or ETFs to keep your tax hit lowâ€”nobody wants to be slapped with capital gains out of nowhere!

Always tailor your strategy to your personal goals, and if youâ€™re feeling overwhelmed, get a financial pro in your corner to help you navigateâ€”it's your money; make it work!
