Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (2024 and 2023) or $30,000 if over age 50.
     - IRA: $6,500 (2024 and 2023) or $7,500 if over age 50.
  
3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed within the year they are realized, which can be beneficial for short-term needs.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - For long-term retirement savings, prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - For shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a home, travel), consider using taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility with withdrawals.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

By following these guidelines and consulting with a financial advisor, you can effectively allocate your funds across these accounts.
