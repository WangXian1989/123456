(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Generally, a common approach is:

1. **Max out employer match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. The tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement can be very advantageous.

3. **max out 401(k)**: If you can afford it, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable accounts**: With any remaining funds, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are more flexible and provide access to your money without penalties, though they may incur capital gains tax.

5. **Consider asset location**: Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-tax investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! The best strategy for distributing your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really hinges on a few key factors, like how close you are to retirement and how much risk you're willing to take. Hereâ€™s a spicy take:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, freaking max that out first! Itâ€™s literally free money. Get that before you do anything else.

2. **Roth IRA Next**: If you qualify, throw some cash into a Roth IRA. This baby grows tax-free, and when you pull it out in retirement, itâ€™s all yours. No taxesâ€”hell yes!

3. **Full Send on the 401(k)**: If youâ€™ve stuffed the Roth to the brim, go back to your 401(k) and fill that to the max, too. Tax-deferred growth is the name of the game here.

4. **Then Hit the Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve taken care of tax-advantaged accounts, start shoving money into taxable accounts. They give you liquidity, and you can access your cash without penaltiesâ€”just watch those capital gains.

5. **Asset Location Magic**: Keep your high-yield investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts if possible, and stash your bond funds or other interest-bearing stuff in the tax-advantaged plans. Optimize, baby!
