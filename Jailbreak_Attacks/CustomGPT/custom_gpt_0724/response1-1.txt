Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income now, while Roth accounts require tax payments upfront but provide tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Invest for Growth**:
   - Consider investing more aggressively in your tax-advantaged accounts since they benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth. 

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Strategically**:
   - If you've maxed out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a longer time until retirement, you might lean more towards growth investments. If retirement is approaching, consider a more balanced approach to preserve capital.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Life changes and market fluctuations can affect your strategy. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
