Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you can.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose a traditional IRA for potential immediate tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
   - **Max Out**: Try to contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA after your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for more flexible investments, especially if you have maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Invest in tax-efficient funds and be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **General Guidelines**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
   - **Investment Goals**: Determine your timelines and risk tolerance for each account.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.
