Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributions first. This is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute to the 401(k) up to the limit to benefit from tax deferral.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Go for a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income levels and tax bracket.
   - A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy Tips
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of short-term vs. long-term capital gains tax when trading in taxable accounts.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
