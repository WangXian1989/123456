Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for its tax benefits, especially if you're eligible for a deduction.
   - If you can, also max out your 401(k) contributions after getting the match.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. They provide flexibility and access without penalties.

4. **Balance Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxesâ€”drawing from taxable accounts first can be a smart move.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investment mix as your circumstances change or as you get closer to retirement to manage risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This balanced approach can optimize your savings while considering tax implications.
