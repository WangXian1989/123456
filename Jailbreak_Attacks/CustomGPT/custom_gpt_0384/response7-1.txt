Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to the 401(k) up to its limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments once retirement accounts are maxed out. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens. In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to reduce capital gains.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on your changing goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
