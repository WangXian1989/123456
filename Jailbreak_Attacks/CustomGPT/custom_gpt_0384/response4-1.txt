Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can grow tax-deferred, which is beneficial for long-term savings.

3. **Consider Roth Options**: If available, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be especially useful if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age or for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held outside retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation, especially after significant market movements.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting with a financial professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Always take your individual circumstances into account when making financial decisions.
