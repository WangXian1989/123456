To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). If possible, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little income (e.g., growth stocks) to minimize taxes on dividends and interest. 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments and income-generating assets to defer or avoid taxes.

3. **Assess Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you might need access to funds before retirement, keep enough in taxable accounts for emergencies or potential opportunities.

4. **Diversity Across Accounts**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type. Donâ€™t just focus on one asset class; spread out risk by including stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consider professional advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

By strategically allocating your funds this way, you can optimize growth while minimizing taxes and ensuring liquidity.
