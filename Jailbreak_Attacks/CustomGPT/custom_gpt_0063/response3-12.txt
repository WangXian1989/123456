I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Medications**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from certain vitamins or supplements, but consult a doctor before starting any.

5. **Advanced Treatments**: In severe cases, liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
