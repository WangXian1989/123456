To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions if you have low-cost investment options.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may have higher tax implications, like stocks, since long-term capital gains have favorable tax treatment.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are spread across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Think about your retirement income strategy and when you'll access each type of account to minimize taxes.

Each individualâ€™s situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
