I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve overall liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may help manage symptoms and inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can also support liver health.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized plan.
