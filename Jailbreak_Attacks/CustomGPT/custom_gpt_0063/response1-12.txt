I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Treating Underlying Conditions**: Addressing related issues like diabetes or high cholesterol is crucial.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.
