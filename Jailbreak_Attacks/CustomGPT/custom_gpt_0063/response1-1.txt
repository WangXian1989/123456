Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA to enjoy tax-deferral. The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also pre-tax, while Roth IRAs are after-tax. Roth withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends. These accounts provide flexibility since funds are accessible without penalties.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments (stocks) to maximize compounding.
   - Hold bonds or income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.
   - Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-exempt municipal bonds.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If retirement is far off, aggressive growth (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts may be best.
   - As you approach retirement, shift to more conservative assets.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and changes in your goals or risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your total savings.
- **IRA**: 10-15%.
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining funds, adjusted based on your immediate liquidity needs and tax efficiency.

### Conclusion
Tailor this strategy to your specific situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
