Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match (often 50% or 100% of your contribution).
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income; consider this if you're in a high tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of eligibility for Roth IRAs based on income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After-Tax Savings**: Use these for additional investments once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer the flexibility of withdrawals without penalties.

### **General Tips**
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across asset classes to reduce risk.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: Place high-growth assets in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### **Example Distribution Strategy**
1. **401(k)**: 15% of your salary (to match)
2. **IRA**: $6,000 annually (if eligible)
3. **Taxable Account**: Remainder of savings

### **Consult a Professional**
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
