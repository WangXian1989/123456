Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 2. Assess Contributions
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to max contributions for both your 401(k) and IRA if possible. The 2023 limits are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus catch-up contributions if age 50+).

### 3. Additional Savings in Taxable Accounts
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized your tax-deferred contributions, funnel additional savings here. Focus on:
     - **Long-Term Investments:** Favor investments with favorable long-term capital gains rates.
     - **Tax-Efficient Funds:** Use index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.

### 4. Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance
   - **Younger Investors:** More equity exposure in your 401(k) and IRA for growth potential.
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Conclusion
- Start with tax-advantaged accounts, max out contributions, then allocate excess funds to taxable accounts. Adjust based on age, risk tolerance, and financial objectives.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
