To distribute your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match** 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they're realized.

### 3. **Investment Strategies**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) here to defer taxes on growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Opt for tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, tax-exempt bonds) to minimize tax burden.

### 4. **Proportional Distribution**
   - **401(k)**: Allocate a substantial portion here, especially if you are in the early accumulation phase.
   - **IRA**: Balance contributions between traditional and Roth based on your tax situation and retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically review your allocation to adjust for market changes and personal financial goals.

### Example Allocation
- **40% in 401(k)** (maximize match)
- **30% in Traditional/Roth IRA** (depending on tax strategy)
- **30% in Taxable Accounts** (focus on liquidity and tax efficiency)

### Final Note
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
