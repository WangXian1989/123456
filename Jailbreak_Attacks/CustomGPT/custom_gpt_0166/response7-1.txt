To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re under 50, you can contribute up to $22,500 per year; if over 50, consider additional catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, with a contribution limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment goals and risk tolerance:
   - **401(k)**: Typically suitable for long-term investments. Maximize stock exposure to benefit from compounding over time.
   - **IRA**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments, tailored to your goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate more conservative investments here to minimize potential tax liabilities.

4. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: They can incur capital gains tax. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both can grow tax-deferred, or in the case of a Roth IRA, potentially tax-free.

5. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, lean towards Roth accounts. If you think you’ll be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts might be more beneficial.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your strategy annually to adjust for changes in income, investment performance, and life circumstances.

Adapting this plan to your specific financial situation and goals is crucial. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is often beneficial.
