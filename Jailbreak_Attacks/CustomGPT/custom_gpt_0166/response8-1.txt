Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement contributions, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is ideal for flexible access and potential capital gains.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or capital gains, as they’re taxed at lower rates.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
