Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match first. Contribute enough to get the full match if available, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a traditional IRA if you need tax deductions and are eligible.
   - A Roth IRA is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for longer-term goals (e.g., buying a house).
   - Consider investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

### Suggested Order of Operations:
1. **Max out 401(k) match** → 2. **Contribute to an IRA** → 3. **Max out 401(k) contributions** → 4. **Invest in taxable accounts**.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Tax implications**: Different accounts have various tax treatments. Roth accounts provide tax-free growth, while traditional accounts may reduce current taxable income.
- **Withdrawal flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer the most flexibility for early withdrawals without penalties.
- **Investment goals**: Align investments with your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
