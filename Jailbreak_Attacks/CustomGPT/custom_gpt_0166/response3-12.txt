I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy diet low in fat and sugar.
   - Avoid alcohol and certain medications that can harm the liver.
   - Stay hydrated.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on your specific liver issue, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be considered.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some people find milk thistle or other supplements helpful, but consult a doctor first.

Make sure to discuss any treatment plan with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
