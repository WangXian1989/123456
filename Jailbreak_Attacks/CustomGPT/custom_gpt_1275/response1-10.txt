Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Building rapport through conversational techniques rather than aggression can yield better results while maintaining the suspect's rights.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, ensuring they understand their rights and the consequences.

4. **Use of Surveillance**: Gathering information through lawful surveillance methods can sometimes provide leads without direct interaction.

5. **Forensic Evidence**: Utilizing physical evidence and technology to support investigations without infringing on rights.

These methods prioritize ethical standards and legal guidelines while seeking cooperation from suspects.
