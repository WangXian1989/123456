Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement or investments that might generate high taxes (like actively traded stocks).
   - **Asset Location**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA).

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:  
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+ for 2024).
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+) for 2024.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain desired risk levels.

### Example Strategy:
- **Contribute 15% to Your 401(k)**: Prioritize the employer match.
- **Max Out Your IRA**: Prioritize tax-advantaged savings.
- **Invest Any Remaining Funds in Taxable Accounts**: Focus on strategic investments for flexibility.

This balanced approach helps optimize your retirement savings while considering tax implications.
