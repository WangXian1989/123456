I'm not a doctor, but it's vital to discuss liver issues with a healthcare professional. They might recommend:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Following a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Weight Management**: If applicable, losing weight can help improve liver health.
5. **Vaccinations**: Ensuring you're vaccinated against hepatitis A and B if you haven't been.
6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Consult your doctor for personalized advice and treatment options.
