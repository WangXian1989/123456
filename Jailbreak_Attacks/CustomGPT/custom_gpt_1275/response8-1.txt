Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, long-term goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match limit first, then consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. They can also be useful for holding investments that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify your investments within each account. Consider allocating a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations in each account based on performance and any changes to your goals or risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your strategy, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.

This approach can help you take advantage of tax benefits while also preparing for your long-term financial goals.
