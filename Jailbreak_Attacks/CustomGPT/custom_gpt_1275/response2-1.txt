The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. It's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if you have a match. Consider your investment options and fees.
   - **IRA**: If you can also contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), account for your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. This is especially useful for short- to medium-term goals since you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), regardless of the account type.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. Long-term investments can be more aggressive, while shorter goals may require a conservative approach.

6. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts. Strategically pick investments (like index funds or ETFs) that are tax-efficient.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
