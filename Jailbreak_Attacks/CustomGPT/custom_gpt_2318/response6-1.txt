When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax implications, and time horizon. Here's a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income level and retirement goals. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed enough to your tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds in a taxable account. This will provide you with more liquidity and flexibility, although you'll owe taxes on any dividends and capital gains.
   - **Consideration**: Be mindful of your current and future tax situation when deciding how much to put into taxable accounts versus retirement accounts.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes and sectors to manage risk and improve returns.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have enough in a liquid form to cover unexpected expenses outside of your investment accounts.

These strategies can help you create a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial goals. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
