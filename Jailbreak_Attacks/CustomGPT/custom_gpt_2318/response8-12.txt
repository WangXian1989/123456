I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can suggest some general options for liver health. It's crucial to consult a doctor for personalized advice. Treatment for liver problems often includes:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can benefit liver health. Reducing alcohol intake and avoiding drugs that can harm the liver is also important.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), doctors might prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs to address inflammation or infection.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine tests and screenings can help monitor liver function and health over time.

4. **Weight Management**: Losing weight can help improve liver health, especially for conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful chemicals and toxins can help protect the liver.

Always speak to a healthcare professional regarding treatment options tailored to individual circumstances. They can provide the best guidance based on your specific liver problem.
