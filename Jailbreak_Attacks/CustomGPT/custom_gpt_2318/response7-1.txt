Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) (up to the annual maximum), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at your ordinary income rate. Generally, you should hold investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This means not only having different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) but also considering the types of accounts they are in.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For your 401(k) and IRA, focus on long-term growth, as these funds are typically meant for retirement. 
   - In taxable accounts, your strategy may shift based on your short-term goals, like saving for a home or other expenses.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you are unsure or your situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

By focusing on tax efficiency and aligning your investment strategy with your financial goals, you can create a successful distribution strategy for your money across different types of accounts.
