I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for your liver problem, as they'll be able to provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or possibly procedures, depending on the severity and type of liver issue you are facing. Always seek professional medical advice for health concerns.
