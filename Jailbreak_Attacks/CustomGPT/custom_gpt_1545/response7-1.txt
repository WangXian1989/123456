Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a breakdown of each account type and a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Benefits**: Contributions are tax-deferred, and many employers offer matching contributions.
- **Strategy**: Maximize employer matching contributions first. If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
- **Benefits**: Tax benefits depending on the typeâ€”traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
- **Strategy**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals assuming certain conditions are met. If you're closer to retirement, consider a traditional IRA for tax savings now.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Benefits**: Flexibility in accessing funds and investing without tax penalties.
- **Strategy**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you plan to retire early. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing heavily.
2. **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute to your 401(k) enough to get the full employer match, then fund your IRA.
3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, as they provide tax benefits over time.
4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### **Example Allocation**
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (up to match)
- **IRA**: $6,500 annually (for individuals under 50)
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after maxing out above accounts

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Consider consulting a financial planner for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.
