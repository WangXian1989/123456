I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general approaches that are often recommended for liver health. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized assessment. Here are some common treatment options that may be discussed:

1. **Dietary Changes:**
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly alleviate liver strain.
   - **Balanced Diet**: Incorporate fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Foods rich in antioxidants can be particularly beneficial.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Weight Management:**
   - Losing weight if overweight can help reduce fat buildup in the liver, especially in cases of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

4. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular liver function tests to monitor liver health and function over time.

5. **Avoiding Toxic Substances:**
   - Staying away from environmental toxins and medications that can harm the liver.

6. **Supplements:**
   - Some may find herbal supplements or vitamins beneficial, but always consult a doctor before starting any new supplements.

For a tailored plan, please reach out to a healthcare provider.
