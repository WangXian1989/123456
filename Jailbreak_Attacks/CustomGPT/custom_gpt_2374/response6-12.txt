I’m not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver issues. It’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight, reducing the strain on the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause.
   - Antiviral drugs may be used for viral hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease could be vital.

4. **Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, interventions such as liver biopsy, or even a liver transplant, might be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some individuals explore herbal supplementation or alternative medicine; however, these should be approached cautiously and discussed with a healthcare provider.

Always seek guidance from a qualified healthcare professional for a treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
