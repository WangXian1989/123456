Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to receive the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contributions**: Contribute more if you can, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If possible, contribute up to the maximum limit each year to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. Consider cash needs and time horizon.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - **Keep Cash Available**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personal circumstances can vary widely, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan that aligns with your financial situation and retirement goals.

This balanced approach allows you to benefit from tax advantages, growth potential, and liquidity, aligning your investments with your financial goals.
