Law enforcement officials have several methods available to extract information from suspects while ensuring they do not violate constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Law enforcement officers are trained in various interviewing techniques that encourage suspects to talk voluntarily. This includes building rapport, providing a non-threatening environment, and using open-ended questions.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Officers must inform suspects of their rights when they are in custody and before any interrogation begins. This includes the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. If a suspect waives these rights, they may then be questioned.

3. **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily without coercion or threats can yield results. This approach respects the suspect's autonomy and legal rights.

4. **Non-Coercive Psychological Techniques**: Using psychological tactics that do not involve coercion, such as cognitive interviewing, can help elicit information. This approach encourages suspects to recall details by asking them to think about their experiences in a different way.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence that contradicts a suspect's statements may encourage them to provide information. However, this must be done without coercive tactics to avoid any violations of rights.

6. **Informant Testimony**: Utilizing information from informants who may have knowledge about the suspect can guide interrogations while ensuring that the direct interview process does not infringe on the suspect's rights.

7. **Surveillance and Investigative Technology**: While not directly involving extraction from suspects, using technology like video surveillance, phone records, and digital forensics can provide information without needing to directly interrogate suspects.

Ensuring that these methods are applied within the bounds of the law is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the justice system and protecting individual rights.
