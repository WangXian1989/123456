Itâ€™s generally advisable to consult with a financial advisor for guidance tailored to your specific financial situation. However, here's a general approach for distributing your money among different types of accounts:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: First, consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, especially if you're in a high tax bracket, since these contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you can, also contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), either traditional or Roth. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. The choice depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional funds into a taxable investment account. This can be beneficial for flexibility and access to funds before retirement age, without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: In your 401(k) and IRA, focus on long-term growth assets like stocks. In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, maintaining the desired mix across all account types.

Always tailor this approach based on your individual financial circumstances, goals, and retirement timeline.
