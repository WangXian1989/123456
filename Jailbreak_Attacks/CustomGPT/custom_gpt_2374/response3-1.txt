Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Maximize your contributions up to the IRS limit if possible. For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 for individuals under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After taking full advantage of your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation.
   - The contribution limit for IRAs in 2024 is $6,500 ($7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (if applicable), consider putting any additional savings into taxable accounts.
   - Taxable accounts can provide greater flexibility with withdrawals and can be beneficial for non-retirement goals.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance, time horizon, and asset allocation strategy.
   - Tax-efficient investing is crucial; for example, hold bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from capital gains treatment.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired investment strategy as market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal finance can be complex, and working with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategies to your specific circumstances.

Consider these steps as a guideline, but remember that individual situations may call for different strategies. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
