Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Continue Funding the 401(k)**: If possible, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you’re looking to save for retirement in a tax-advantaged way.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out the above accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional investing. Here, you should consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, which can help minimize your tax burden.

5. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: Tailor your allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and how far you are from retirement. Younger investors may focus more on growth, whereas those closer to retirement may prioritize stability.

6. **Rebalance Your Portfolio Regularly**: Ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your long-term goals by periodically rebalancing your portfolio across accounts.

This balanced approach allows you to take full advantage of tax benefits while ensuring liquidity for your needs.

For personalized advice, it’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your specific situation.
