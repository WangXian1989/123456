When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth), which grows tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but has different contribution limits and eligibility requirements. Traditional IRAs follow the same tax rules as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on capital gains and dividends, so gains will impact your taxable income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Check the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with a catch-up contribution for those over 50).

3. **Investment Horizons**:
   - Evaluate how soon you need the money. If you plan to retire soon, you might want to focus more on taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you will withdraw funds during retirement. Having different account types can provide flexibility in managing taxes.

5. **Employer Matching**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

### Possible Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably Roth if eligible, for tax-free growth).
3. **Continue to contribute to 401(k)** up to the annual limit.
4. **Invest excess funds in taxable accounts** for liquidity and potential capital gains treatment.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

This is a simplified approach; consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation is always a good idea.
