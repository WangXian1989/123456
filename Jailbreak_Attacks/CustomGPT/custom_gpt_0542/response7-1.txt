To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out employer matching contributions first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but subject to capital gains tax. Use them for liquidity needs or investments that generate qualified dividends.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate growth-oriented assets (like stocks) to accounts with higher tax burdens (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Hold bonds or other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Consider Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (especially if there's a match in your 401(k)).
   - Save for future tax implications; aim for tax diversification in both accounts over time.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Maintain your desired asset allocation by periodically adjusting the investments across your accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, begin withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Be strategic about how and when you withdraw from your 401(k) and IRA to manage your tax burden effectively.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help you tailor your investment strategy according to your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

With this approach, you'll create a balanced investment strategy that optimizes both growth and tax efficiency.
