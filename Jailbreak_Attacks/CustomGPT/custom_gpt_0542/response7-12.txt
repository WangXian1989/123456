I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options for liver problems that you might discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol are crucial steps in managing liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, treat infections, or manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and imaging tests to monitor liver function and condition.

4. **Interventional Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like endoscopy or liver biopsy may be necessary.

5. **Transplantation**: In severe cases of liver disease, a liver transplant may be the only option.

6. **Supplements and Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but it's essential to consult a doctor before considering these.

Always consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
