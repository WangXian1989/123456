The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive approach to help you decide:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that often includes a company match. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs also allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals, depending on eligibility. Consider each type based on your current and expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are investment accounts that are not tax-advantaged. Capital gains and dividends are subject to taxes in the year they are realized.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), you should aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Build up Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After securing the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (if applicable).  For the 2023 tax year, the contribution limit for traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - Then, return to your 401(k) to increase your contributions towards its limit. The contribution limit for 401(k)s for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts are suitable for investments you may need to access before retirement or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting. 
   - Focus on holding investments that produce long-term capital gains (which are taxed at a lower rate) within taxable accounts, while keeping higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or reduce taxable income.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Adopt an asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance. For instance, you may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where taxes on interest income would apply.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations in response to changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your entire financial picture.

By employing this strategy, you can effectively distribute your funds among those accounts to balance growth potential with tax efficiency.
