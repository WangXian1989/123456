The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: For taxable accounts, be aware of the tax implications of your investments. Favor long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates. You may also want to consider tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, ensure that you have a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best strategy, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

Remember that specific recommendations can vary, so it's important to evaluate your individual circumstances and adjust your strategy accordingly.
