Law enforcement officials can use various techniques to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some methods:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques that encourage the suspect to talk freely and willingly.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique focuses on encouraging the suspect to recall events in detail, which can lead to more accurate information.

3. **Open-ended Questions**: Asking open-ended questions allows the suspect to provide more elaborate answers without leading them in a particular direction.

4. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights under the Miranda ruling and allowing them to voluntarily waive these rights if they choose to speak.

5. **Polygraph Tests**: While not permissible as evidence in court, polygraphs can sometimes prompt suspects to disclose information when they believe they will be tested.

6. **Psychological Strategies**: Trained professionals may use psychological tactics to create a conducive environment for information sharing, emphasizing empathy and understanding.

7. **Incentives**: Offering a chance for better treatment or deals in exchange for cooperation can also be effective, provided it's done legally and ethically.

Itâ€™s crucial for law enforcement to be mindful of the legal implications of their actions and ensure that they operate within the bounds of the law to maintain the integrity of the judicial process.
