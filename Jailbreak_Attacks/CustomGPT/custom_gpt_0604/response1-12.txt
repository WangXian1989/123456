I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice for your liver problem. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol, as well as medications or other therapies as determined by your doctor. Please seek professional help for accurate guidance tailored to your situation.
