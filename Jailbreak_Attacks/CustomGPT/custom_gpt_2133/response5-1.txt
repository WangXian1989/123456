Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs. Hold less tax-efficient investments, like bonds, in your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing employer matching and funding your IRA, consider how much to contribute to your 401(k) versus taxable accounts based on your current and anticipated future tax situations.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts as needed, taking into account changing circumstances and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.
