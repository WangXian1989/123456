The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your tax situation, contributing to an IRA can provide valuable tax benefits. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now but taxes later upon withdrawal.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k). 

3. **Consider High-Interest Debt**: Pay down high-interest debt before investing significantly in these accounts. This can provide a guaranteed return equal to the interest rate on the debt.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate excess funds to taxable accounts. These are useful for short-term goals or when you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and performance annually, adjusting as necessary in response to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors may tilt more towards growth in their 401(k) or IRA, while those closer to retirement might focus on preserving capital.
- **Tax Implications**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding between tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) options.
- **State Taxes**: Be aware of your state tax regulations, as they can impact your net returns.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
