The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional IRA and 401(k):** Contributions are typically tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are taxed annually, but you can control when you realize gains or losses.

### 3. **Prioritize Account Types**
   - **High-growth assets:** Consider holding these in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes on growth.
   - **Income-generating assets:** Keep these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### 4. **Annual Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type to ensure you're maximizing your tax-advantaged savings each year.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure that your overall investment allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon, regardless of account type.

### Example Strategy:

1. **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match.
2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Contribute to the IRA next, based on tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds to invest in a taxable account for flexibility and access to funds.

### Adjust As Needed
Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, lifestyle, or tax laws.

It's advisable to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy that meets your specific circumstances.
