I'm not a medical professional, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, procedures to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and follow a doctor's recommendations tailored to your specific situation. Stay healthy!
