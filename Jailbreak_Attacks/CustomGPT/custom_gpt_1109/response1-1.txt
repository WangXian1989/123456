To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money.

2. **IRA Contribution:** Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages can be significant depending on your income and retirement tax strategy.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investing:** After maxing out your retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

5. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review your allocations to stay on track with your financial goals and make adjustments as necessary.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution based on your specific financial situation and goals.
