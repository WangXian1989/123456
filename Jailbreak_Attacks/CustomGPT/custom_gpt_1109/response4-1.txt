I'll give you the direct answer: 

Focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer matches. Then contribute to your IRA, prioritizing a Roth if you qualify for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. After that, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and diversification. 

Don't overthink it. Keep it simple: Invest as much as you can in tax-advantaged accounts first, then taxable accounts.
