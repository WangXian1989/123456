I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health and treatment options. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some commonly recommended approaches for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance:** Refrain from alcohol consumption, as it can exacerbate liver issues.

2. **Medical Treatments:**
   - **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause.
   - **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and progress.

3. **Alternative Therapies:**
   - **Herbal Supplements:** Some people find relief with certain supplements, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment.

Remember, always seek professional medical advice tailored to your condition.
