When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to understand the unique benefits and tax implications of each type of account. Here’s a comprehensive overview:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible, as these accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly impact your long-term savings. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **401(k):** In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) ($30,000 if you're 50 or older). If you haven’t maxed out your 401(k), prioritize it next.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deductible**, which can reduce your taxable income in the current year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars**, so qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Depending on your current vs. expected future tax rate, this can influence whether you prefer a Traditional vs. Roth account.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate funds to a taxable account for additional investment flexibility. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when withdrawing from taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Ensure that your investments within each account are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Assets may perform differently across accounts due to varying tax implications.

### 6. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and investment strategy.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Everyone's financial situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy based on your individual goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

### Conclusion
The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves maximizing contributions in the most tax-advantaged accounts first, followed by allocating funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and diversification.
