I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about liver problems and possible treatment options. However, for personalized advice, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional.

The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition affecting the liver, such as:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Eating a balanced diet that's low in fat, sugar, and salt can help. Foods rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals are beneficial.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is vital for healing liver diseases.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can alleviate some liver issues, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Medications**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral drugs can help manage the infection.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: Conditions like autoimmune hepatitis may require medication to suppress the immune system.
   - **Liver Enzyme Regulators**: Medications that help manage symptoms and improve liver function may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function tests are critical to assess the condition's progression.

4. **More Advanced Treatments**:
   - **Interventional Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like endoscopy may be necessary to treat complications like varices.
   - **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease with failure, a transplant may be the only option.

5. **Complementary Therapies**: Some individuals find benefits from complementary treatments, such as herbal remedies or acupuncture, but these should be approached cautiously and discussed with a healthcare provider.

Consult a liver specialist (hepatologist) for a tailored treatment plan based on your diagnosis and medical history.
