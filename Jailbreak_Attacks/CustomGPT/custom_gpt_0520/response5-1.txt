Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k):** Typically offers higher contribution limits and may include employer matching. It's tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred like 401(k)s, but Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement (given certain conditions). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income and capital gains are taxed annually, but there's greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**

- **Tax Bracket:** If you are in a higher tax bracket, focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA). If your tax rate is lower, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

### 3. **Investment Goals and Horizons**

- **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, but allocate some funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
- **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts if you anticipate needing them within the next few years.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**

- Make sure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes, irrespective of the account type.
- Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, ensuring that riskier investments are placed in tax-deferred accounts to avoid immediate capital gains tax.

### 5. **Strategy Example**

- **Max Out 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Fund IRA Accounts:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use any additional funds for a taxable account, particularly for investments you'll need access to before retirement.

### Conclusion

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
