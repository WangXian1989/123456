To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older). Aim to contribute as much as you can within these limits.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, choose accordingly.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit is $6,500 for 2024 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older). Maximize this if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments with high potential returns, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.
   - Tailor your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on life changes (job changes, salary increases, etc.) and market conditions.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals. Prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) in retirement.

By balancing your contributions among these three types of accounts, you can create a more tax-efficient and growth-oriented investment strategy. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
