Distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts come in traditional and Roth types, with tax advantages. Annual contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts without tax advantages. Taxes on capital gains and dividends are due in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement. 
   - **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains are taxed when securities are sold. Holding investments for over a year lowers tax rates on long-term gains.

### 3. **Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Allocate more volatile investments (like stocks) into tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more stable investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maxing out IRA contributions (if eligible) before contributing more to your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Account Contributions**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement or for long-term investing that benefits from capital gain tax rates.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your investments periodically to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals, making adjustments as necessary.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out up to employer match, then 10-15% of income.
- **Traditional or Roth IRA**: Max contributions if possible ($6,500 annually, or $7,500 if you're over 50 for 2023).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest what remains after fulfilling the above, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
Tailor your allocations based on personal circumstances. You might consider consulting a financial advisor to further optimize your distribution based on your specific situation.
