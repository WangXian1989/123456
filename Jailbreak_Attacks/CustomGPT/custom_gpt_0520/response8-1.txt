Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term goals** (e.g., buying a home): Favor taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-term goals** (e.g., retirement): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** 
     - Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
     - Employer matching can boost growth.
     - Limited investment options may apply.
   - **IRA:** 
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.
     - Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on deposits.
       - Consider income limits for contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Flexible withdrawals; no tax advantages.
     - Capital gains taxes apply on profits.

### 3. **Tax Implications**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.
   - Strategic withdrawals from taxable accounts can help manage tax liabilities.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks or mutual funds, given their tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Balance between growth and income-producing assets while considering the tax impact on dividends and interest.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and alternative investments can reduce risk.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds from each account type during retirement to optimize tax efficiency.

### 7. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Monitor performance and adjust contributions as needed based on changes in income, goals, and tax laws.

### Suggested Distribution
- **Short-term needs:** Focus on taxable accounts.
- **Medium-term needs:** Use IRAs.
- **Long-term savings:** Max out 401(k), then fund IRAs before considering taxable accounts.

### Summary
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation. Regularly revisiting your distribution strategy helps ensure alignment with your evolving financial landscape.
