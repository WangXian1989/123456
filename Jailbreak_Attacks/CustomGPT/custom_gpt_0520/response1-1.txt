Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current situation, and tax considerations. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored with potential matches. Contributions are pre-tax, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal in retirement (Roth). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After-tax investments; you pay capital gains taxes on profits and dividends as you realize them.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: If you need funds soon, prioritize taxable accounts. For retirement, lean towards 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Retirement Age**: The closer you are to retirement, the more you might want to maximize tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**
   - At minimum, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially "free money."

### 4. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After getting the match, consider maxing out IRA contributions (especially if you're eligible for Roth). For 2024, the limits are:
     - 401(k): $23,000 (plus an additional $7,500 if over 50).
     - IRA: $6,500 (plus an additional $1,000 if over 50).

### 5. **Allocate Funds Strategically**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-free. Use more conservative investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Prefer tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

### 6. **Rebalance and Review**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and goals. Adjust contributions accordingly.

### 7. **Consider Professional Advice**
   - If you’re unsure, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your needs.

### Conclusion
Start with your 401(k) match, then consider maxing out an IRA before funding taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency. Adjust as needed based on your financial situation and market conditions.
