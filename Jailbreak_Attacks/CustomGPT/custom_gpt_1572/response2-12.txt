I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Eliminate or significantly reduce alcohol consumption.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieve a healthy weight through diet and exercise.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies might be necessary to track liver health and detect any progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplantation may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements or traditional medicine, but always discuss these with your doctor first.

Make sure to follow your doctor's recommendations and attend all follow-up appointments for the best management of your condition.
