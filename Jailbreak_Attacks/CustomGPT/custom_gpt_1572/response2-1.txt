Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Diversify Investment Types**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds. Your allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you might have more investment options. Choose investments that complement your 401(k) holdings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for assets that may not benefit from tax-advantaged growth, like bonds or real estate. Be mindful of tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Funds in your 401(k) and IRA are usually taxed upon withdrawal, while taxable accounts allow you to manage tax liability by choosing when to sell investments.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Your Situation**
   - Life events, changes in income, and shifts in tax laws can necessitate adjustments to your distribution strategy. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation and goals.

### General Allocation Suggestion:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of income
- **IRA**: Up to the maximum allowed ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if 50 or older)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate what’s left after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

This approach aims to optimize tax efficiency and growth potential.
