To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits to a 401(k). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed in the year they are realized. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize taxable events.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed each year. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to rise.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds beyond your retirement contributions and for short-term goals.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented funds given the long time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Maintain some liquidity for emergencies or short-term goals, as these funds are easily accessible.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Prioritize retirement growth; access penalties often apply before age 59Â½.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Assess your distribution strategy annually or as your financial situation changes, adjusting as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

Implementing these steps will help you create a balanced approach to your investments across your various accounts.
