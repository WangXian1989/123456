Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts: Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Look for low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: You have more investment options. Diversify across stocks, bonds, and possibly alternatives based on your risk profile.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Withdrawals and Taxes**
   - Be mindful of how withdrawals will impact your tax situation. Traditional accounts are taxed as income, while Roth accounts and investments in taxable accounts may have different tax implications.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review your allocation at least annually to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If retirement is decades away, you can afford to be more aggressive. As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Younger Investor (e.g., under 40)**: 70% in 401(k)/IRA (for tax savings), 30% in taxable accounts.
- **Mid-Life Investor (e.g., 40-60)**: 60% in 401(k)/IRA, 40% in taxable accounts.
- **Near Retirement (e.g., 60+)**: 50% in 401(k)/IRA, 50% in taxable accounts.

### Final Tips
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
- Monitor legislative changes that may affect retirement account contributions and tax rules.

This structured approach helps optimize growth while minimizing tax implications.
