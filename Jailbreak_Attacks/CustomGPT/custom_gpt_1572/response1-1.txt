Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially useful if you expect to need access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and dividend taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and align with your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your risk tolerance or financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can be invaluable.

Consider your immediate and long-term financial goals when distributing your investments.
