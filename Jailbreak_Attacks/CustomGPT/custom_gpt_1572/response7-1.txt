Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any company match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Ideal for high-income years, as you can lower your taxable income now and pay taxes later.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Good for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you'll need before retirement or for short-term goals.

### 3. **Investment Planning**
   - **401(k):** Typically a mix of mutual funds and stocks; choose a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** More investment options than a 401(k); consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you maintain a healthy emergency fund separate from retirement accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 20-30% of savings, focusing on employer match and diversified funds.
- **IRA:** 10-20% of savings, with an emphasis on long-term growth and tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10-15% of savings for shorter-term goals or flexible access to funds.

### Conclusion
Personal finance is unique to each individual. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
