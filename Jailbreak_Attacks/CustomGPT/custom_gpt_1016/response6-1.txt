To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts provide tax benefits either on contributions or withdrawals.
   - **Utilize Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Fund your taxable account for short-term expenditures to avoid penalties on tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on aggressive growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA where you have a longer timeline for compounding.

### 3. **Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Maintain some liquidity in your taxable account for emergencies, as you can withdraw without penalties.
   - **Plan for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Remember that you will need to take RMDs from your tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) starting at age 73.

### Conclusion
Balancing your investments across these accounts enhances tax efficiency while aligning with your financial goals. Regularly review your allocations in response to changes in your financial situation or tax laws.
