To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maximizing your IRA contributions. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction.

2. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings or money market account, covering 3-6 months of expenses, before allocating significant funds to investments.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance, age, and investment goals. Generally, you can afford more risk (like stocks) when you're younger and gradually transition to more conservative investments (like bonds) as you near retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or municipal bonds, which can generate lower taxes on capital gains and income.
   - Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially as your financial situation can have unique nuances.

7. **Investment Horizon:**
   - Align your investment choices with your timeline for needing the funds. Longer timelines can handle more volatility.

By focusing on these strategies, you can create a well-rounded distribution of your investment funds across different account types.
