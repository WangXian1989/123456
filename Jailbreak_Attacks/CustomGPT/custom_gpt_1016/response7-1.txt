To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k), especially if it offers low-cost investment options. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50).
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. 2023 contribution limits are $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older). The choice between Traditional and Roth will depend on your current vs. expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income. Keep in mind that funds in these accounts can be more accessible for short-term needs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all three account types to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Different accounts have different tax implications. Prioritize tax-efficient investment strategies. For example:
   - Hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to avoid higher taxes on interest income.
   - Keep high-growth assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and rebalance your asset allocation across your accounts regularly to maintain your desired investment strategy.

7. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible format outside of these investment accounts.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
