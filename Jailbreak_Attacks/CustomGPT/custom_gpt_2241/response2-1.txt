Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timing. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is effectively free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRAs**: If eligible, make the maximum contribution to your IRA (especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, continue to add to your 401(k) up to its limit.

3. **Invest Based on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Hold Bonds in Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Since interest income from bonds is taxed at ordinary income rates, hold them in your 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Consider Tax Strategies**:
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, sell losing investments to offset gains and lower your tax bill.
   - **Draw from Taxable Accounts First**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation stays aligned with your goals and risk tolerance, adjusting contributions as necessary.
