The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (traditional or Roth) before adding to taxable accounts. This helps reduce taxable income and grow investments tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since you pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free in retirement.
   - In higher brackets, traditional accounts may offer immediate tax benefits.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a cash account before investing excess funds in taxable accounts.

5. **Investment Objectives**: Align your investments with your time horizon:
   - Long-term goals (retirement) can be funded through tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for a taxable account, where you can access funds without penalties.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance, you may want to hold different allocations in each account type.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and performance, adjusting as needed based on market conditions and life changes.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual situation.
