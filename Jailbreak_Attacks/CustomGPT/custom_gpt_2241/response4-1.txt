Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but offer flexibility with withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term goals benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your savings.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts allow for easier access to funds, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals may incur penalties if taken before retirement age.

5. **Investment Types**:
   - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains, while more stable investments may be suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all account types to mitigate risk.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy to your specific circumstances.
