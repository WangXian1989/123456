(Î±) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly influence your long-term financial growth and tax liabilities. The optimal approach depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and the specific investment options available within each account.

To begin, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. Following this, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits based on your income level and future tax expectations. Once the limits for these retirement accounts are met or if you can contribute more, consider allocating any additional funds into taxable accounts. This strategy not only diversifies your investment but also provides more flexibility through accessible funds. Balancing between these accounts should align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon, ensuring a strategy that maximizes both growth and liquidity.
