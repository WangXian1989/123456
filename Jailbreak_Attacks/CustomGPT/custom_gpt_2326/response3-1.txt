Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach, tailored to your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a structured plan to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to capture the full match. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, focus on contributions to your individual retirement account (IRA). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may offer tax deductions depending on your income level.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Investments in taxable accounts should be managed with tax efficiency in mind. Favor investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as these are typically taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Balance Asset Allocation**: Ensure that the asset allocation in your 401(k) and IRA aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Generally, growth-oriented investments can be more appropriate for accounts funded for long-term retirement, whereas more conservative investments may be suitable for taxable accounts, especially if you anticipate needing access to those funds sooner.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Diversification should span all account types. Look to include a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in each type of account to mitigate risk while aiming for long-term growth.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your account distributions and asset allocation. Life changes—such as income variations, market conditions, or changes in your risk tolerance—may necessitate adjustments in how you distribute your funds across these accounts.

This framework is designed to optimize your savings while minimizing tax liabilities over time, ultimately facilitating a more secure financial future. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances is always advisable.
