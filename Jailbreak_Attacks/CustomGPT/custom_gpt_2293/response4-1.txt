Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before contributing to taxable accounts. This can help you reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 ($30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).
   Ensure you’re aware of these limits and adjust your contributions accordingly.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Tax Implications:** 
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider the tax implications of investment gains; long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan where you’ll draw from in retirement. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility without penalties, while withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts may incur taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
