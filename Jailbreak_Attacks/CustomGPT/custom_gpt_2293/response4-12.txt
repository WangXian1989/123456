I'm not a doctor, but I can give you a general overview. Treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity aids liver function and overall health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can be crucial for recovery.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat infections.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver health and function are essential.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures to remove tumors or even liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some people explore herbal supplements, but it's important to discuss these with a healthcare provider first.

Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific liver condition.
