Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider increasing contributions to the annual limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, which can be beneficial depending on your income.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments that can provide liquidity or diversification. Treat them as a supplement to your retirement accounts.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impacts on short-term gains.

### 3. **Balance Growth and Risk:**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where your gains can grow without facing immediate taxes.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to limit taxable income from interest payments.

### 4. **Reevaluate Regularly:**
   - Adjust your allocation as you age or your financial situation changes. Shift towards less aggressive investments as you near retirement.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Be aware of capital gains taxes on taxable accounts and how withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) will impact your taxable income in retirement.

### Conclusion
Customize your distribution based on your unique goals and consult a financial advisor for tailored advice that considers your entire financial picture.
