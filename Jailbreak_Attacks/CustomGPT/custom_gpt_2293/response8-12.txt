I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options for liver problems that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fat, sugar, and salt)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol and recreational drugs

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Supplements**: Some might benefit from vitamins or supplements, but it's essential to consult a healthcare provider.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
