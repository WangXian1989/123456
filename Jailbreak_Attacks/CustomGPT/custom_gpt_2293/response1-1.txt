Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s free money!

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, put additional money into taxable accounts. This is especially useful for goals that are shorter-term.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, high-growth assets might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments could go in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in a taxable account. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

6. **Review Regularly**: Check and adjust your allocations periodically in response to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific needs.
