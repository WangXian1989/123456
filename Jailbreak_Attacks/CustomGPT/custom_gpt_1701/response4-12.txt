I'm not a medical professional, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for the most suitable treatment options for liver problems. Generally, treatments can vary depending on the specific liver condition (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medication to manage symptoms or infection, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. Always seek professional medical advice tailored to your situation.
