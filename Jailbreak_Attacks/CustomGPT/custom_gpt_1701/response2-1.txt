Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: If you can still save after contributing to your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps reduce your taxable income, especially if it is a Traditional 401(k).

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties and can be beneficial if you have short- to medium-term financial goals.

5. **Investment Considerations**: Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts, as they generate fewer taxable events. Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that could generate high taxable income, like bonds or actively managed funds.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation may change, so review your asset allocation and contributions regularly in light of your goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This strategy should provide a balanced approach tailored to mitigate taxes while investing for long-term growth.
