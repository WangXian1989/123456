To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**: Understand your retirement goals, when you plan to retire, and your risk tolerance. This will help you decide how aggressively you want to invest.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions (and taxes are paid on withdrawals), while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. This can make them less efficient for long-term growth compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investment options across all accounts are diversified. You can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds aligned with your risk profile.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**: Stay informed about the annual contribution limits for each account type to fully capitalize on tax advantages.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Plan for your retirement withdrawal strategy. Decide which accounts you will draw from first, keeping in mind the tax implications.

By distributing your funds thoughtfully among these accounts, you can optimize your savings for retirement while managing your tax obligations effectively.
