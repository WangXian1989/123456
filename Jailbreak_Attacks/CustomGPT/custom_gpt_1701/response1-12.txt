I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options that are typically discussed for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized plan. Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and toxic substances.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, there may be medications available to help manage symptoms or slow disease progression.
3. **Supplements**: Some people find benefits from certain vitamins and herbal supplements, but it's crucial to discuss these with your doctor to avoid adverse effects.
4. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the condition.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered if the liver is significantly damaged.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for diagnosis and tailored treatment options!
