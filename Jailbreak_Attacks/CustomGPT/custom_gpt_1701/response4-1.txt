To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the contribution limits for each account type. For example, as of 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **Assess Your Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to at least contribute enough to receive the full match, as it is essentially free money.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Conversely, Roth accounts (both Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA) enable tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility.

4. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

5. **Prioritize Saving:**
   - Consider your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you foresee needing funds before retirement, prioritize putting money in taxable accounts for better liquidity.

6. **Review Your Age and Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you are younger and still have many years until retirement, you might focus more on growth, leaning into stocks within tax-advantaged accounts. As you approach retirement, shifting to more conservative investments may be wise.

7. **Consider Future Tax Brackets:**
   - Anticipate where you may fall in terms of tax brackets in retirement to help decide between traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (after-tax) contributions.

8. **Revisit and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Your financial situation may change, necessitating a review of your contributions and asset allocations annually or with significant life changes.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and liquidity according to your individual financial goals. If you're still unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
