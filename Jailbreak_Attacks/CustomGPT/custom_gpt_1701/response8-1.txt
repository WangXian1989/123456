When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy typically involves balancing tax benefits, growth potential, and liquidity needs. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match first before moving to other accounts. The annual contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and over).
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and over).

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth account may be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, Traditional accounts may be better if you seek immediate tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are ideal for money you might need before retirement. Investments can be more flexible, but keep in mind the capital gains tax on any profits.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance, timeline, and investment goals. For long-term growth, consider equities for your 401(k) and IRA, while using taxable accounts for more liquid, short-term investments.

4. **Maintain an Emergency Fund:**
   - Keep adequate liquid funds outside of retirement accounts for unexpected expenses. This ensures that you won’t have to withdraw from your retirement accounts, which could incur penalties.

5. **Review and Adjust Annually:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you’re unsure, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your particular situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for growth and tax efficiency while considering your financial goals.
