Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA could offer immediate tax benefits if you are currently in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions. The 401(k) typically has higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Consider investing in taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals, such as buying a house or funding education. These offer more flexibility since you can access your money without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. Higher-risk investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) while more stable investments (like bonds) could be placed in taxable accounts to manage taxes on capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation regularly based on market conditions, investment performance, and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If possible, work with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution plan to your specific financial goals and situation.

This balanced approach helps maximize tax benefits while ensuring you're saving adequately for retirement.
