Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest enough to get the full employer match. After that, consider the IRA.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. If you can't contribute to a Roth due to income limits, focus on the Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth through diversified funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's traditional or Roth, consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to manage your tax liability effectively.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
