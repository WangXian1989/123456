Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors: your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - Then, consider maximum contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and future tax expectations).

2. **Account Type Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for tax-deferred growth. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this is beneficial.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax. They’re useful for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) should hold more aggressive investments, as you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal (or never in the case of a Roth).
   - Consider holding lower-growth investments in your taxable account to minimize tax exposure.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to mitigate risk.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Over time, your asset allocation may shift. Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired balance.

6. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking personalized advice to address your specific circumstances and goals.

Before making any major decisions, ensure you understand the tax implications and contribution limits associated with each account type.
