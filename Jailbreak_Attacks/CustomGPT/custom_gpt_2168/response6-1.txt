Distributing your money among different account types like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Prioritize this if your income allows it.

### 2. **Consider Asset Location:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that produce lower taxable income (like index funds) or tax-efficient investments. Avoid high dividend-yield stocks and actively managed funds that generate short-term gains.

### 3. **Diversify Investment Types:**
   - **Growth vs. Income:** Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral, while holding income-generating investments in taxable accounts to manage tax impact.

### 4. **Assess Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Consider your current tax rate and expected tax rate during retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritizing Roth accounts might be wiser.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. 

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income, maxing out potential employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use remaining funds for investments with favorable tax implications.

### Conclusion:
Your exact distribution should be tailored to your unique financial situation, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
