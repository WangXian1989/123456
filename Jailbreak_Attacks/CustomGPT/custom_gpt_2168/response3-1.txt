To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantage Evaluation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. A traditional IRA can offer immediate tax benefits if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible access to funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

3. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio:
   - **401(k)**: Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar diversification strategies apply, and you may have more investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower capital gains, or hold long-term investments to minimize tax impact.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Adjust your investment strategies based on how long you have until retirement. Longer time horizons can typically tolerate more risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary greatly, and professional advice can help tailor a strategy that's right for you.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while considering tax implications and your financial goals.
