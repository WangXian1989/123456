Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contribution limit if possible ($22,500 for under 50, $30,000 for 50+ in 2024).
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Depending on your income, consider maxing out your IRA contributions ($6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for 50+ in 2024). A Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for money you may need in the short term since they have different tax implications (capital gains taxes).
   - Generally, hold investments that generate qualified dividends in taxable accounts and keep bonds or high-turnover investments in your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**
   - If youâ€™re younger and have a long investment horizon, aggressive growth investments may be suitable for your 401(k) and IRA. For more immediate needs (money needed in the next few years), keep those funds in your taxable account.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure each account is diversified properly. Riskier investments could be better in retirement accounts where taxes won't impact you until withdrawal.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Contributions**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation. Adjust contributions based on changes in income or financial goals.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **First:** Contribute to 401(k) up to employer match.
- **Second:** Contribute to an IRA (preferably a Roth if you're eligible).
- **Third:** Back to the 401(k) up to the maximum limit.
- **Lastly:** Use taxable accounts for any surplus savings or emergency funds.

### Conclusion
Always review your financial situation annually or when significant life changes occur. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
