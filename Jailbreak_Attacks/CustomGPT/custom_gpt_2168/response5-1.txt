Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you can contribute further, consider using a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are generally made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free, making it a great option if you expect tax rates to rise in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax on profits when sold. They provide more flexibility to access funds without penalties but require careful tax planning.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks, ETFs) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) since they have the potential for higher returns and tax growth. Reserve more conservative investments (bonds, cash) for taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities on interest.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially if certain investments have performed dramatically better than others.

Tailor these strategies to your unique situation and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
