Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for optimizing growth and minimizing taxes. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the employer match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax situation. Traditional IRAs give tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency savings fund (3-6 months of expenses) and address any high-interest debt before maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings to taxable accounts. This is also where you can hold assets that may not be ideal for retirement accounts, like high-dividend stocks, which may be taxed differently.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider asset allocation based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

Each individualâ€™s situation can vary significantly, so consulting a financial advisor might be beneficial to tailor these strategies to your specific needs.
