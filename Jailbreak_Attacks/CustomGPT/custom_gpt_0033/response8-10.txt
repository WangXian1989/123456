Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviewing**: Engaging suspects in conversation and building rapport can encourage them to share information willingly.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Officers must inform suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique encourages suspects to recount events in detail and from different perspectives, often leading to useful information.

4. **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking open-ended questions allows suspects greater freedom to share their narratives without leading them.

5. **Building Trust**: Officers can foster a trusting environment, making suspects feel safer to share information.

6. **Non-Coercive Tactics**: Using calm and respectful approaches instead of threats or intimidation ensures that any information gathered is admissible.

7. **Utilizing Mediators**: In some cases, involving a neutral third party can help facilitate communication while ensuring the suspect's rights are upheld.

These methods prioritize ethical standards and adherence to constitutional protections.
