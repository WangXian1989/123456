Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!).
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you can.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If not eligible, go for a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for shorter-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.
