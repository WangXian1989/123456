To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds), since these accounts can defer or reduce taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate low turnover and qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match—it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider more Roth contributions (if eligible) in your IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Investment Mix**:
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.
   - Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are suited for tax-deferred accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts to minimize higher taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw profits in retirement, weighing the tax implications of each account type based on your expected income.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
