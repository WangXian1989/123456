I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options often depend on the specific condition. Generally, here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing excess weight can reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis management.
   - **Liver Supplements**: Such as milk thistle or antioxidants (consult a doctor).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Completely avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
