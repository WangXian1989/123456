Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No special tax benefits but offer flexibility for withdrawals at any time.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your goals (retirement, purchasing a home, etc.) and timeline for each investment.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves before heavily investing.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Follow annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRAs to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match before considering other accounts.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or if you have maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Opt for tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocation periodically to adjust based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Allocation:

- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%
