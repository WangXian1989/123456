Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Hold investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate income (like bonds) since capital gains tax may be lower than ordinary income tax.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications in retirement. Generally, it might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. **Keep an Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you maintain a liquid emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts to avoid penalties and taxes on early withdrawals.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions based on tax advantages and growth potential can optimize your overall returns and minimize your tax burden. Adjust your strategy as your financial situation evolves.
