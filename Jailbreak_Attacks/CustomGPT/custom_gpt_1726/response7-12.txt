I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health treatments. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.
   - Regular physical activity.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medicine may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues, such as antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Regular check-ups will be essential to monitor liver function and make necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In more severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Supportive Care**: Nutritional support and counseling may be beneficial, especially if the liver issue impacts your eating habits.

Please reach out to a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your situation.
