To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to your IRA, taking advantage of tax benefits (traditional vs. Roth) based on your income and tax situation.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) where you can defer taxes or enjoy tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as municipal bonds or funds with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider your current and expected future tax brackets to decide whether to prioritize tax-deferred (401(k) and Traditional IRA) or tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts.
   - Balance the timing of withdrawals based on your retirement income needs and tax strategies.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you maintain a portion of savings in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies to avoid penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a diversified approach that not only aims for growth but also optimizes your tax situation.
