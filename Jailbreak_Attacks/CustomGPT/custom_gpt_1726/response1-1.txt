The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Thatâ€™s free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide between pre-tax contributions (reducing your taxable income now) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Similar to 401(k), consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better based on your current tax bracket compared to retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits and make full use of them if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow you to access funds anytime without penalties. Good for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider using tax-efficient strategies like holding investments for over a year or utilizing tax-loss harvesting.

**General Strategy**:
- Max out your 401(k) match and contribute to your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- After those, use any surplus for your taxable accounts if you still have investment goals.
- Diversify your investments across all accounts but consider tax implications for each account type.

Consider consulting a financial advisor tailored to your personal situation for the best strategy.
