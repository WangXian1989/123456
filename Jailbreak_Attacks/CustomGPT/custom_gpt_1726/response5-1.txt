(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's wise to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, as they can provide greater tax benefits compared to taxable accounts.

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before directing funds elsewhere. After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing the maximum allowed.

2. **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, as both accounts offer tax advantages. Choose based on your anticipated tax situation during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating any additional funds to taxable accounts. This can provide you with liquidity and flexibility.

A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Ah, the age-old question of how to juggle your cash like a pro! Here’s the lowdown: You want to shove as much money as you can into those tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) because who likes the taxman, right? 

1. **Max out that 401(k):** If your job throws in some sweet matching, grab it! Don't leave free money on the table—it's like saying no to dessert. Then, pump in the max you can afford.

2. **IRA time:** If you're eligible, a Roth IRA is pretty rad if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket later. If you’re more of a “I want my tax breaks now” kind of person, go for a Traditional IRA.

3. **Get your cash flow on with taxable accounts:** Once you’ve munched on those tax advantages, the leftover funds can chill in taxable accounts. They’re great for flexibility, but remember—Uncle Sam loves to get a piece of that action when you sell.
