To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors: 

1. **Tax Advantages**: 401(k) and IRA contributions often come with tax benefits, like tax-deferred growth or tax deductions. Prioritize funding these accounts to maximize tax advantages.
  
2. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, for example, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Matching Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions on the 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

4. **Investment Options**: Examine the investment options available in each account. Your 401(k) may have more limited investment choices compared to an IRA or taxable account.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts, which have age and tax considerations for withdrawals.

6. **Your Financial Goals**: Consider your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you plan to access funds before retirement, a taxable account may be more suitable.

7. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts provide proper diversification to mitigate risk.

A common strategy is to max out the employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA up to the limit, and finally, invest any additional funds in your taxable accounts. Always tailor your approach based on individual circumstances, as personal financial situations vary widely. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your overall financial plan.
