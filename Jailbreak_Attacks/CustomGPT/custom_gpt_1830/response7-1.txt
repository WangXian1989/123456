The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, age, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Account Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and Traditional IRAs allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Focus on high-growth investments in these accounts since you won’t pay taxes on them until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as they’re taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. You might also consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio remains diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Each account can hold a mix of assets that align with your overall strategy.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations across accounts to ensure they remain aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about how to allocate your funds effectively, consider seeking help from a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
