The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth and employer matching.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but flexibility in withdrawals. Useful for short- to mid-term investment goals.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Retirement Focus:** Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Higher contribution limits than IRAs. Consider maximizing the match first.
   - **IRA:** Know the annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for over 50 as of 2023).

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max Out 401(k) Contributions First** (up to employer match)
- **Contribute to IRA** (especially Roth if eligible)
- **Invest Any Remaining Funds** in Taxable Accounts for short-term goals or as needed

Adjust this based on your specific financial situation and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
