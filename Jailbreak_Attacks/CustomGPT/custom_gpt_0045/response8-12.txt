I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular liver function tests help track the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, especially for liver tumors or severe scarring.

5. **Transplant**: For advanced liver disease, a liver transplant might be an option.
