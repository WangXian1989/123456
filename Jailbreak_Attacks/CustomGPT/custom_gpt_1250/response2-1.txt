The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - If you can afford to contribute beyond the match, consider maxing out your contributions if it aligns with your overall investment strategy.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - A Traditional IRA may be beneficial if you wish to defer taxes now, particularly if you are currently in a high tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and are not subject to the same contribution limits as retirement accounts.
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax; holding investments for over a year can help you benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with contributions that maximize tax-advantaged accounts.
- Allocate funds based on your investment timeline, risk tolerance, and diversification needs.
- Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.
