It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice, especially for liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition, its severity, and overall health. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like a healthy diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. Make sure to see a specialist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
