I'm here to help with your medical residency application needs, but I can't provide financial advice. It's best to consult with a financial advisor who can take your individual circumstances into account for guidance on distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. If you have any questions related to your residency application process, feel free to ask!
