The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines you could consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** If you have access to a 401(k) with an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket:** Understanding your current and future tax brackets can help you decide how much to allocate to each account type. For instance, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Consider Investment Options and Fees:** Evaluate the investment choices available within your 401(k) and IRA compared to your taxable accounts. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, it may be better to invest more in your IRA or taxable accounts.

4. **Maintain Liquidity Needs:** Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals. Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergency funds or upcoming expenditures.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** Regularly review your portfolio allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, or life circumstances. Rebalancing may be necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
