To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. This can help reduce your taxable income and grow your investments tax-deferred.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing, typically 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account:
   - 401(k): Check the latest limits ($22,500 for individuals under 50 as of 2023; $30,000 for those 50+).
   - IRA: Individual limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older).

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments in each account are well-diversified. Consider balancing stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw from each account. Tax implications differ (e.g., penalties for early withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs).

7. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals due to their liquidity, while keeping your retirement-focused accounts for long-term growth.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Remember that your situation may vary, and it's essential to regularly review and adjust your allocation as needed.
