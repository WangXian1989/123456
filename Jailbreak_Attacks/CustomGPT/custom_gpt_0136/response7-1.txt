The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. It's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k)**: If you're eligible, aim to maximize your 401(k) contribution limits, especially if you’re looking for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals before retirement without penalties.

5. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to pay that off before aggressive investing.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your asset allocation strategy across all accounts, focusing on a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Seek advice from a financial advisor to tailor your strategy specifically to your situation.
