To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key points:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account has different contribution limits set by the IRS. Familiarize yourself with these to maximize your tax advantages.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: Generally, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA for tax-advantaged growth. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match first.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in each account. Some plans may have better investment choices than others, which can influence where you allocate funds.

4. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon**: Assess your risk tolerance and the time frame for each account. Long-term retirement accounts can typically take on more risk compared to taxable accounts where you may need liquidity sooner.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Utilize your taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments. Consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here to minimize tax burdens compared to ordinary income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your overall asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Professional**: If in doubt, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can strategically distribute your funds to support your long-term financial goals.
