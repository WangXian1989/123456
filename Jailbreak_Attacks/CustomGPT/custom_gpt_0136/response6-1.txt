When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Use this account for investments with higher growth potential since taxes are deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Prioritize account withdrawals based on tax implications during retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

4. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Review your investment allocation periodically (at least annually) and adjust based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

By blending these strategies, you can optimize your retirement savings while managing your tax burden effectively.
