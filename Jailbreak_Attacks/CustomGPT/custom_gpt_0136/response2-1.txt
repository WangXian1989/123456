When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Good for higher tax brackets now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on future tax expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower tax burdens (like index funds or long-term capital gains). They can also provide flexibility.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically in a savings account.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example:
   - **Aggressive**: More stocks in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.
   - **Conservative**: More bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile and asset mix.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Consider drawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance tailored to your situation, consider speaking to a financial advisor.

Always keep in mind your long-term financial goals when deciding on distribution.
