To optimize your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) to at least get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider fully funding an IRA (traditional or Roth) since it offers tax advantages depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Utilize taxable accounts for additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. This provides flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance and goals. Generally, high-growth assets (like stocks) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while more stable investments (like bonds) can go in taxable accounts.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and market changes.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, seeking personalized guidance can help you create a distribution strategy tailored to your situation.

Consider your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when making decisions. Always consult with a financial advisor or tax professional for guidance specific to your situation.
