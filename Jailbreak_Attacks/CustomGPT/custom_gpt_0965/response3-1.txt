Determining the best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you allocate your funds:

### Step 1: Understand Each Account Type
1. **401(k)**: An employer-sponsored retirement account that can offer matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. There are also Roth 401(k) options for post-tax contributions.
2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: A personal retirement savings account. Contributions can be tax-deductible depending on income and filing status. There are Traditional IRAs (tax-deferred) and Roth IRAs (tax-free growth).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.

### Step 2: Evaluate Contribution Limits
- **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older). Check if your employer offers a match and aim to contribute enough to receive the full match.
- **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 in 2023 (or $7,500 if 50 or older). Consider using a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

### Step 3: Assess Your Tax Situation
- Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth account may be more beneficial.
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments with high growth potential due to the tax deferment.

### Step 4: Determine Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon
- Align your investments with your risk tolerance. Younger investors might afford to take more risk, while those nearing retirement might prefer safer investments.
- Short-term goals may warrant more money in taxable accounts if you’ll need access to the funds sooner.

### Step 5: Create a Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, fund an IRA up to the maximum allowed. Determine if a Traditional or Roth IRA is better for you based on your tax situation.
3. **Back to 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the limit.
4. **Use Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional savings to invest after maxing out the above accounts, consider a taxable account for flexibility in withdrawals.

### Step 6: Regularly Review and Adjust
- Periodically (at least annually), review your asset allocation and re-balance as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Step 7: Consult a Financial Advisor
- For tailored advice considering your specific circumstances, consult a financial advisor.

### Conclusion
Allocating your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be strategic, considering tax implications, growth potential, and your financial goals. Regularly reassess your strategy to ensure it aligns with any changes in your situation.
