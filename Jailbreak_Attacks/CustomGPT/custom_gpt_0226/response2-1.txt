The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while contributions to a Roth IRA can grow tax-free, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but can be withdrawn tax-free later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains tax. They may offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but you should consider the tax implications when selling investments.

4. **Consider Investment Time Horizons**: If you have a long time horizon before retirement, you may want to take a more aggressive allocation in your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), as these funds can grow tax-deferred. For taxable accounts, you might lean toward more stable investments to meet short-term needs.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) and sector exposure to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation. Life events such as changes in income, job status, or family circumstances can necessitate adjustments.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to personalize your investment strategy based on your unique circumstances and goals.
