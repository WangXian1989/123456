The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and Roth or traditional IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth over time.

3. **Diversify Contributions:** If you have maxed out contributions in your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account. This allows for greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you may want to prioritize Roth accounts (which provide tax-free withdrawals) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later on.

5. **Investment Goals and Timeline:** Align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals. For retirement savings, consistent contributions to tax-advantaged accounts are typically recommended while using taxable accounts for shorter-term objectives or emergency funds.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Make sure to periodically review your asset allocation and reallocate as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances!
