The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals but may have tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that have high growth potential (like stocks) since you won't pay capital gains taxes until withdrawal. Conversely, consider holding more stable investments or tax-efficient funds in your taxable account.

5. **Regularly Reassess Asset Allocation**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that optimizes your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively. Remember to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
