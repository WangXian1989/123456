I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest some general options that people with liver issues might consider. It's important to consult a healthcare provider for diagnosis and personalized treatment.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise can help support liver function.

2. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Minimizing or completely avoiding alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

3. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

4. **Treatment for Hepatitis**: If hepatitis is the cause, antiviral medications may be recommended.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with a healthcare provider can help monitor liver health and detect any changes early.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always reach out to a healthcare professional to discuss symptoms and appropriate treatments tailored to your situation.
