Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Plan**: Prioritize contributing enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions if possible to benefit from tax-deferred growth and lower taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA next, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth and may provide tax deductions depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can provide flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, although capital gains taxes may apply when you sell.

Make sure to also consider your overall investment strategy, focusing on asset allocation that balances risk and potential return.
