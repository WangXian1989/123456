I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific liver condition. They might recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies depending on the severity of the issue. Please seek medical advice from a qualified professional.
