To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

1. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) contributions are often pre-tax, offering immediate tax benefits. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions on contributions, with taxes owed upon withdrawal.
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages on contributions, but capital gains taxes are typically lower than ordinary income rates.

2. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Prioritize Roth IRA (if available): Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, offering long-term tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to take advantage of lower tax rates.

3. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically assess the performance of your investments and adjust contributions as needed across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

By considering these strategies, you can maximize your investment returns while managing tax implications effectively. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
