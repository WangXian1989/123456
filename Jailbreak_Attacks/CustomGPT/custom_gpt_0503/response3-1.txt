To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Offered by employers, often with matching contributions. Tax-deferred growth, but penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Also tax-deferred, with various types (Traditional vs. Roth) affecting tax treatment.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains taxes and interest income. Offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA after maximizing the 401(k) match.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings or investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** Focus on higher growth investments since taxes are deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Opt for investments that are tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize immediate tax liability.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor the performance and allocation of your investments. Rebalance annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw funds, considering tax impacts and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 25%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 25%
