To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Employer matching can significantly boost your savings.
   - **IRA**: Offers traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals) options. Contribution limits are lower than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match early in the year; this is free money and should be prioritized.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if over 50) and up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - Ensure you stay within these limits when distributing funds.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Current Tax Situation**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, consider maxing out a traditional 401(k) and a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.
   - If you expect your income to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Maintain a sufficient amount in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term goals to avoid penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 6. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**
   - Use retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments with higher growth potential.
   - Consider more liquid or lower-risk investments in your taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get the employer match, then consider additional contributions if you have room.
- **IRA**: Focus on contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for taxable investments, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

### Next Steps:
- Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice and to consider your long-term financial goals, risk tolerance, and specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and work towards your financial goals effectively.
