To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plans, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth), reducing taxable income. 
   - **IRA:** An individual retirement account that offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not have tax advantages, but you can access funds anytime. Capital gains from investments held for over a year are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Efficiency:** Hold stocks or other higher-growth investments in your taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.
   - **Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Since bonds generate interest taxed as ordinary income, consider holding them in IRAs or 401(k)s to shield that income from taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Adjust your portfolio based on age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Younger investors might prefer more equities for growth, while those nearing retirement might prefer bonds for stability.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Adjust contributions to each account as needed based on performance and changing financial situations.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match (e.g., 5-10% of your salary).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions each year ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 as of 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out the above, use any additional savings for taxable investments.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the ideal distribution will depend on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
