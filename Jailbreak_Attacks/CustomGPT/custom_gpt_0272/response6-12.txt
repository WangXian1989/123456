1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: If hepatitis is involved.
   - **Liver Support Supplements**: Such as milk thistle or other hepatoprotective agents.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoid Toxins**:
   - Minimize alcohol intake and avoid substances harmful to the liver.

Please seek medical advice for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your condition.
