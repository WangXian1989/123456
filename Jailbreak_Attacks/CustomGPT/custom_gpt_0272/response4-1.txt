To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs (Traditional or Roth) after maxing out the 401(k) match. 

3. **Diversification**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and age.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), choose investments to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you might need in the short term. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure you stay aligned with your retirement goals.

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Be mindful of current and future tax implications when deciding how much to allocate to each account type.

This balanced approach will help you grow your wealth while considering your liquidity needs and tax efficiency.
