I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some typical approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: A healthy, balanced diet low in fat and sugar can be beneficial. Foods rich in antioxidants, like fruits and vegetables, may support liver health.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of liver disease.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - If alcohol is contributing to liver problems, abstaining is crucial.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, surgical options or procedures (like liver biopsy or even liver transplant) may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
