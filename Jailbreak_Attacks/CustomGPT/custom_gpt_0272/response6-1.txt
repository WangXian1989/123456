To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contribution:**
   - Max out contributions, especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - Focus on high-growth investments for long-term growth.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Utilize a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use these accounts for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.

**General Tips:**
- **Diversification:** Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts.
- **Tax Considerations:** Be strategic about withdrawals and tax implications for each account type to minimize your tax burden in retirement.
