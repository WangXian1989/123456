The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in your taxable account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to this account, especially if you have high-income years.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions if you're eligible, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Investments**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, focus on growth-oriented assets (stocks) since gains aren't taxed until withdrawal (or at all with a Roth).
   - In taxable accounts, hold income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) that are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts during high-income years.
   - Reassess annually or with major life changes (new job, marriage, etc.).

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your personal situation is also recommended.
