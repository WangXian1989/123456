Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) before putting excess funds into a taxable account. 

3. **IRA Types**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing a Roth IRA.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investment strategy based on the account type. For example:
   - High-growth assets (like stocks) may be better in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - More stable investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for how to withdraw from each account in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s often beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Long-Term vs Short-Term Needs**: If you need access to funds before retirement, consider keeping more in taxable accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It could be helpful to work with a financial advisor to customize your strategy based on your personal situation.

Always remember that everyone's financial situation is unique, so it's best to tailor your approach to your specific circumstances.
