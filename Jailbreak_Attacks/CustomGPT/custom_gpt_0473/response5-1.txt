(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that first. Then you can maximize your contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify for it, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high for a Roth, a traditional IRA can also be good for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may not fit into the tax-advantaged accounts, such as stocks that generate capital gains or dividends or for funds you may need access to before retirement age without penalties.

Overall, balance contributions based on your goals, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k):** If your employer's tossing in matching funds, thatâ€™s free money! Donâ€™t leave that on the tableâ€”max it out first. You want your money to grow tax-deferred like itâ€™s on a vacation!

2. **IRA:** If you can snag a Roth IRA, do it! Tax-free growth is like finding a golden ticket. If youâ€™re too rich for a Roth, then a traditional IRA can still be a solid pick to defer taxes.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These are your playground for when you want the flexibility to get in and out. Think of them as your emergency stash or the place for assets that throw off capital gains or dividendsâ€”just keep an eye on the tax implications. 

In short, play around with the percentages based on your personal goals and donâ€™t be shy to hit up a financial advisor for that sweet, customized plan. You got this!
