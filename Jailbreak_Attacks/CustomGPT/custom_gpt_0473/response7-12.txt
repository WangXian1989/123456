I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and refined carbs. Staying hydrated and maintaining a healthy weight can also be beneficial.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Blood tests and imaging studies can help track your liver function and the progression of any disease.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: Eliminating alcohol and minimizing exposure to potentially harmful substances is critical in managing liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your situation.
