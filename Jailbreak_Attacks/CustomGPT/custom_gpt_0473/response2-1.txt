When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. This helps you minimize your taxable income now and grow your investments tax-free or tax-deferred.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If you can afford it, aim to contribute up to the annual limit.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation. Roth IRAs are advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount if feasible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may trigger taxable events (like stocks or ETFs with low turnover) to minimize taxes.
   - Consider holding assets like municipal bonds that provide tax-free income.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level, especially as markets fluctuate.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Be mindful of the order in which you withdraw funds in retirement to optimize tax efficiency.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can effectively manage your contributions and investments across your accounts.
