Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy that aligns with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. For 2023, consider maximizing your contributions.
   - **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts to lower your taxable income.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments focusing on growth because you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Utilize taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term, keeping in mind capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts to cover emergencies without incurring penalties or taxes associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 4. **Asset Location**
   - **High-Growth Assets**: Place higher-risk, high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Low-Growth Assets**: Consider holding more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable capital gains tax rates.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then increase contributions as needed.
- **Regular IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings here with a focus on ETFs or index funds to minimize tax implications.

### Summary
- Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first before allocating surplus funds to taxable accounts.
- Continuously assess your tax situation and adjust contributions to align with changes in income, expenses, and financial priorities.
