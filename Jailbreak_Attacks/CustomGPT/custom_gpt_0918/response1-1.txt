Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored Plans First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out contributions if it fits your budget, as 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income.

### 2. **Utilize IRAs**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. It's suitable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Depending on income limits, consider splitting contributions between a Traditional and a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for mid-term goals.
   - Focus on investing in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Consider Asset Location**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest and distributions.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances, ensuring you make informed decisions that align with your goals.
