Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture the full match—it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Assess Tax Advantages**: 
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs) are beneficial for reducing taxable income now. 
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be advantageous for capital gains tax management.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of living expenses, to avoid needing to tap into retirement funds early.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Within each account, consider a diversified investment approach based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors may opt for more aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement might prefer conservative options.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Align your contributions based on when you’ll need the funds. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and tax-advantaged accounts for long-term retirement savings.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and retirement planning, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your individual circumstances.

By considering these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your investment potential over time.
