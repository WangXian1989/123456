Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Fund an IRA**: After securing the employer match, consider funding a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is funded, look to maximize your 401(k) contributions. This is especially advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts and have additional money to invest, taxable accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties. They are ideal for shorter-term goals or emergency funds.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified. Consider your risk tolerance, age, and investment horizon when allocating among stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax on distributions. Conversely, hold higher-taxed investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations based on performance, goals, and changing circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can also provide personalized guidance.
