Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term Needs**: Focus on taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. Understand Contribution Limits
   - **401(k)**: Higher contribution limits; consider maximizing contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Lower limits; evaluate if you’re eligible for tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals.

### 3. Tax Considerations
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in tax treatment.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money; qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments, but you can offset some gains with losses.

### 4. Asset Allocation Strategy
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) here to benefit from compounding and tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more conservative investments (like bonds) to manage taxes efficiently.

### 5. Diversification
   - Ensure your overall portfolio across all accounts is diversified to mitigate risks.

### 6. Regular Review and Rebalancing
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation periodically based on performance, life changes, or shifts in your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** (up to match)
- **Contribute to IRA** (consider Roth if eligible)
- Any excess funds or short-term savings go into **taxable accounts**.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach tailored to your specific financial situation, tax implications, and investment goals is key to effective distribution among your accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.
