I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition affecting the liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and sometimes procedures or surgeries. Please see a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs.
