To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), but often with more investment options. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on income and participation in an employer's plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: All gains are subject to capital gains tax and interest income is taxed as ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Consider the annual contribution limits for each account. For example, 401(k) limits might be higher than IRA limits.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Identify your financial goals (retirement, education, etc.) and how soon you plan to access your funds. Longer-term goals might benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

5. **Management Fees**: 
   - Be aware of any management fees associated with the accounts and choose investment options with lower fees to maximize your returns.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan how you intend to withdraw funds during retirement to minimize taxes and ensure longevity of funds.

A common strategy is to max out employer-sponsored 401(k) contributions first (especially if there's a match), then contribute to an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts if you have additional funds. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
