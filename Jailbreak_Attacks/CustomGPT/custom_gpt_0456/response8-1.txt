To optimize your investment strategy and determine the best way to distribute your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals), this can impact your tax situation now and in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and defer taxes.
   - Have a strategy for withdrawals in retirement—draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Match your investments to your time horizon. Longer-term investments can afford more volatility—in stocks, for instance—while shorter-term funds should be more stable.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balanced allocation across all accounts, considering factors like your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals.
   - Diversify within each account to mitigate risk.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically assess your portfolio’s performance and rebalance your investment allocations as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and retirement goals.
