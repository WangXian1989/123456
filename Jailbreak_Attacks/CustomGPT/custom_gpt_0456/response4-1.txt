To provide you with the best distribution strategy for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I would need to know more about your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current investment allocations. However, here are some general considerations for distributing your money across these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, itâ€™s usually wise to contribute enough to receive the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your IRA and 401(k) first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, for instance, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Different accounts can serve different purposes. Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term, tax-advantaged growth, investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. For your taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be strategic about managing taxes on your investments. Short-term gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at higher rates, so consider holding investments for longer periods, when possible.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Over time, your investments will grow at different rates. Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

For a more tailored approach, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help you create a comprehensive investment strategy based on your unique financial situation.
