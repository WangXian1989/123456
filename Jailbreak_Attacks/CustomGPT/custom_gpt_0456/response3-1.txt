Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach you can consider:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - 401(k): Check your employer's plan for contribution limits. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if you're aged 50 or older).
   - IRA: You can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older) to a traditional or Roth IRA.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributions up to the match, as it’s free money.
   - After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Debt Considerations**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to pay that down before heavily contributing to retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Your investment choices should align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might lean more towards equities, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Taxable accounts are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Favor investments that yield tax-efficient returns (e.g., index funds).
   - Place high-growth or high-turnover assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on gains.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your distribution strategy annually or after significant life events to ensure it aligns with your current financial situation and goals.

This strategy ensures you're effectively utilizing tax-advantaged accounts while being mindful of the potential tax implications of taxable accounts. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
