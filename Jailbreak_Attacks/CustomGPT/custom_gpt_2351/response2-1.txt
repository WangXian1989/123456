The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), providing tax advantages that can benefit your long-term growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement). This choice often depends on your current tax bracket and your expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for IRAs, which may change year over year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them a suitable option for short-term savings or specific goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Pay Off High-Interest Debt First**: Before investing, if you have high-interest debt (like credit card debt), consider paying that off first.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, accessible account.
- **Initial Focus**: Start with maximizing your 401(k) match, then contribute to your IRA.
- **Balancing Contributions**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you may want to allocate your funds approximately as follows:
  - **401(k)**: 20-30% of your total savings
  - **IRA**: 10-15%
  - **Taxable Accounts**: 20-40%
  
### Regular Review and Adjustments:
Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
Consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a personalized investment strategy that fits your specific needs and circumstances.
