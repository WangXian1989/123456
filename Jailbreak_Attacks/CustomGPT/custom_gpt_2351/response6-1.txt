Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors such as tax implications, contribution limits, and your overall financial goals. Here’s a concise breakdown to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers higher contribution limits and may include employer matching, making it a great option for retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages (traditional vs. Roth) and may be a good choice for additional retirement accounts, especially if you’re maxing out your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments outside of retirement with more flexibility in withdrawals; however, they are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Suggested Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available).
   - **Contribute to IRA**: Fund your IRA to the maximum limit (if within income thresholds), as it can offer beneficial tax treatment.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Additional Investing**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, invest excess funds in a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. **Adjust Based on Personal Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Prioritize more liquid funds in taxable accounts if you anticipate needing access in the near future.
   - **Retirement Readiness**: Allocate more towards tax-advantaged accounts if your focus is long-term retirement savings.

### 4. **Review Regularly**: 
   - It’s crucial to periodically revisit and adjust your allocations based on changing financial circumstances, market conditions, and retirement goals.

By carefully considering these factors, you can develop a distribution strategy that aligns with your current financial situation and future objectives.
