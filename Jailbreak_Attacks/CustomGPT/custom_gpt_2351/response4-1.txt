Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions (if eligible), while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can be suitable for investment growth that you expect to access before retirement. They also offer more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal. However, be aware of capital gains taxes and consider strategies to minimize them.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: At least annually, review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market changes.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: Depending on how close you are to retirement, you may want to adjust your investments towards more conservative options within your 401(k) and IRA, while still seeking growth in taxable accounts if you won’t need those funds soon.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help you create a strategy tailored to your unique situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
