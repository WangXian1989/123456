Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Good for high-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs can be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Income from investments here is taxed at capital gains rates, which can be lower than regular income tax rates.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term needs might be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - For retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Account Limits**:
   - Max out employer 401(k) contributions, especially to receive matching contributions.
   - Contribute to IRAs up to the annual limit ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for 50+ in 2023).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

### General Strategy
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions (consider Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement).
3. Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and access.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal situation.
