To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Fund a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial later.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs. Focus on investments that generate lower short-term capital gains, such as index funds.
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to reduce risk and optimize growth. Ensure that your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically review your investments and contributions to adjust according to changes in tax laws, market conditions, and your financial goals.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.**
- **Focus on tax efficiency in taxable accounts.**
- **Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.**
