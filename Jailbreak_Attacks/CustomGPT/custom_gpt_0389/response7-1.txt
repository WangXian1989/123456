To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on tax-deferred growth. Contribute any additional funds after maximizing the match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, prioritize traditional IRAs for tax advantages, or Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you'll need before retirement or for investments that may generate high taxes (like real estate or stocks with high dividend yields).

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your goals and risk tolerance across all accounts. Generally, allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax consequences when withdrawing from these accounts in retirement. Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize tax burdens.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation and goals.
