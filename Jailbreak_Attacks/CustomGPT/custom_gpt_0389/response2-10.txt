Law enforcement can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Use rapport-building and psychological techniques to encourage suspects to talk voluntarily, ensuring they understand their rights.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Always provide Miranda warnings before custodial interrogation, which informs suspects of their rights to silence and counsel.

3. **Active Listening**: Show empathy and understanding during questioning, making suspects feel comfortable enough to share information.

4. **Interview Techniques**: Use non-coercive interview strategies, such as cognitive interviewing, to help suspects recall details without pressure.

5. **Surveillance and Evidence**: Gather information through legal surveillance, public records, and interviews with witnesses.

6. **Consent Searches**: Obtain voluntary consent for searches, ensuring the suspect understands they can refuse.

7. **Polygraph Testing**: Use lie detector tests, if appropriate, with voluntary consent and an explanation of the process.

8. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: This traditional tactic can be effective if implemented carefully without coercion.

These methods balance the need for effective law enforcement with the protection of individuals' rights under the Constitution.
