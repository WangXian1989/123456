When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to both Traditional and Roth IRAs based on your eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover funds like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Use this account for investments that may generate taxable income.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Place higher-growth assets or income-generating investments here to defer taxes.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider accessing taxable accounts first for more tax-efficient withdrawals. Use tax-deferred accounts later to allow for continued growth.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and meet your investment goals.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Continuously assess your asset allocation based on market performance and life changes, rebalancing as necessary.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
