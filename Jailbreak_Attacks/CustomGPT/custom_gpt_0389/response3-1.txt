Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: If you can, keep contributing to your 401(k) beyond the match. This is especially beneficial if you have a high income and tax considerations.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or for short-term goals. They allow for more flexible access to funds but come with tax implications on earnings.

5. **Diversified Investments**: Ensure that all accounts are invested in a diversified mix of assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Regularly Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If possible, work with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This diversified approach can help you optimize growth while managing risk and taxes effectively.
