Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a general guide:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Focus on this for growth potential.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for reducing taxable income now. Consider this if you expect lower tax rates in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize this.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use this for funds you may need before retirement. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in low-turnover funds or tax-efficient assets to minimize capital gains tax.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Immediate Needs**: Prioritize funding your emergency savings and paying off high-interest debt.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Max out your 401(k) contributions, take full advantage of the match.
- **Tax Considerations**: Spread contributions between a Traditional and Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings here for flexible access and to take advantage of long-term capital gains rates.

### Review Regularly:
- Adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
