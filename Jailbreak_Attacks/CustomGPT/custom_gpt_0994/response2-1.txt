To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: First, maximize your contributions to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals at retirement) based on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for funds you may need before retirement or for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in your taxable account for liquidity. Aim for 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes in each account to balance risk. Consider using tax-efficient index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) since they have longer time horizons, while more stable investments (bonds) can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll access funds in retirement. Tax laws can influence this strategy significantly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help align your investments with your financial goals and tax situation.

Adjust your strategy based on your risk tolerance, retirement timeline, and any changes in tax laws or personal circumstances.
