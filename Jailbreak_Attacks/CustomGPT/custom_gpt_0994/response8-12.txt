1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy diet low in fats and sugars.
   - Regular exercise to promote weight loss if overweight.
   - Avoid alcohol.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms (e.g., diuretics for fluid retention).

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests (ultrasound, CT scan) as necessary.

4. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - Considered for severe liver disease when other treatments have failed.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan.
