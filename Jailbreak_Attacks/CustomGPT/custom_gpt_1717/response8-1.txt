To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial for long-term growth.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks or mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Stable Products in Taxable Accounts**: In taxable accounts, consider holding more stable investments (bonds, dividend-paying stocks) that may generate taxable events.

3. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer, unless you're in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment choices across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Fees**:
   - Be aware of any fees associated with your accounts, particularly in your 401(k), as they can impact overall returns.

Consulting a financial advisor can further personalize these strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
