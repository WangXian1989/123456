To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize matching contributions from your employer first. This is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, usually around 3-6% of your salary.

2. **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit can be lower than 401(k) but offers tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to retirement accounts, use any additional funds for taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in withdrawals and investments but note that you'll incur capital gains taxes on profits.

### Allocation Strategy:
- Start with maxing out employer match in your 401(k).
- Aim to contribute to your IRA (target $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if 50+).
- Finally, allocate savings to taxable accounts based on your short-term and long-term goals.

### Diversification:
Ensure you're assessing risk tolerance and diversifying investments across all accounts (stocks, bonds, ETFs). Regularly review your asset allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals.

### Tax Considerations:
Consider the tax impacts of withdrawals from these accounts in retirement, aiming for a balance that minimizes tax liabilities. Consult a financial advisor tailored to your unique situation for personalized advice.
