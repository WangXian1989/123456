To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA, prioritizing Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income now.
   - **401(k)**: After maxing out any match, consider contributing more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may require liquidity or for saving for short- to medium-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains tax when withdrawing funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, consider holding riskier assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (to defer taxes) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate regular income, like bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions, changes in tax laws, or shifts in your financial goals.
