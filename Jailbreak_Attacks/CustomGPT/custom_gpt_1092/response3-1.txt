Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible)**
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase.

### 3. **Carry on with 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing the match in your 401(k), continue contributing to it, especially if you are in a high tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.

### 4. **Utilize a Traditional IRA**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for additional tax-deferred growth, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for short-term goals.

### 6. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth and minimize taxes on gains.
   - Conservative investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts, as they may generate interest that is taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically review your distributions and adjust as needed based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice from a financial advisor can help optimize your strategy based on your specific situation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 20%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30%

### Conclusion
Determine your priorities between growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity, and adjust contributions accordingly. This balanced approach can help maximize your wealth over time.
