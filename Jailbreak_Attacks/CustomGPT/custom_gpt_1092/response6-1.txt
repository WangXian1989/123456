Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment goals. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions to at least that amount to take full advantage of "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions depending on your income.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, as they are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This can include stocks or funds that you plan to hold for over a year.

### 3. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focusing on tax-free growth (like in a Roth IRA) can be beneficial.

### 4. **Diversify Investment Types**
   - Allocate funds across equity (stocks), fixed income (bonds), and other assets suited to your risk tolerance and investment goals, across all account types.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Allocation**
   - Revisit your distribution annually or as your financial situation changes, adjusting contributions based on performance and market conditions.

### Summary
- **Prioritize Contributions:** 401(k) (up to match) > IRA > Taxable accounts.
- **Minimize Taxes:** Favor tax-advantaged options for highest efficiency.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your individual circumstances.
