Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's free money. Aim to max out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for investments that generate income or capital gains, as they are subject to taxes in the year they are earned. This includes dividends and short-term capital gains.
   - Consider holding investments with lower turnover, like index funds, to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Goals:** Younger investors might lean more towards stocks in growth accounts, while those closer to retirement may prioritize bonds for stability.
   - **Asset Location:** Stocks may benefit from the tax advantages of tax-deferred accounts (401(k)/IRA), while bonds can be held in taxable accounts since they may have higher tax implications.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### Summary
A potential strategy could be to contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match, max out an IRA, and then allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized approach that considers your specific circumstances.
