Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs can give you an immediate tax break.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. These can be useful for investments with a shorter time horizon or if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Diversity in Investments:**
   - Ensure your investments across accounts are diversified, including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes appropriate for your risk tolerance and time frame.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Think about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k)s and traditional IRAs), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRAs) to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation:**
   - Periodically review your distributions and investment performance to ensure they still align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice from a financial planner can provide tailored strategies based on your individual circumstances.

Establishing a well-considered plan can enhance your investment strategy and future financial security.
