Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out contributions if possible.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be advantageous since withdrawals are tax-free. However, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you understand the contribution limits for IRAs and plan your contributions accordingly.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts can be withdrawn any time without penalties, making it a good option for emergency savings or short-term goals.
   - **Tax Awareness:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when trading in a taxable account. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help mitigate tax impacts.

**Distribution Strategy:**
- Start by ensuring you contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- Next, evaluate your IRA options based on your tax situation and future income expectations.
- After maximizing retirement account contributions, allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts, keeping investment goals and tax implications in mind.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
