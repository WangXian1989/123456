When considering how to allocate your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are a few key factors to consider:

1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement. If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to get the maximum match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs also allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met. Choose a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement; a Roth could be better if you anticipate being in a higher bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, and interest or dividends are taxed in the year they are earned. These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals at any time.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term growth may warrant more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term goals might be more suited for the liquidity of taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification & Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets. Typically, high-growth assets can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable, income-generating investments might be better in taxable accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Max out contributions to these accounts first if you can. The current limit for 401(k) contributions is higher than for IRAs, and both have catch-up contributions for those over 50.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing. This fund should be easily accessible in a savings account rather than invested in higher-risk assets.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might provide tax benefits in the long run.
3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k):** After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute as much as you can up to the limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you have additional funds available after maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and potential growth.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income (max out employer match)
- **IRA:** 10% of your income (max out contributions)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 5% of your income (after maxing out retirement accounts)

### Final Consideration:
Consult with a financial advisor to assess your individual situation, including your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax circumstances. It's essential to have a personalized plan based on your unique needs.
