I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver issues, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional. Common treatments for liver problems can include lifestyle changes like a balanced diet, regular exercise, and abstaining from alcohol. Depending on the specific liver condition, medications or further medical interventions might be necessary. Always prioritize professional medical advice tailored to your unique situation.
