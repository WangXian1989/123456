To maximize your investment strategy, consider the following steps for effectively distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth and often includes employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax on profits, but offer flexibility in withdrawals.

2. **Determine Your Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Align your distribution strategy with your retirement goals, liquidity needs, and investment horizon.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first to take advantage of tax benefits. 
   - Aim for employer match in your 401(k) to get "free money."

4. **Balance Tax Implications:**
   - Consider the tax implications of withdrawals in retirement. Favor tax-deferred accounts for longer-term growth and use taxable accounts for short-term needs.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, managing risks through diversification (stocks, bonds, etc.).

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution to achieve better long-term financial success.
