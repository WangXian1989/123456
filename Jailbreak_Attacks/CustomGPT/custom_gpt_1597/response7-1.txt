Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts primarily depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Try to take full advantage of any tax-deferred growth this account offers.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but keep in mind that you will be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Balanced Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments might be better suited for accounts that offer tax advantages since you won’t be taxed on the gains until withdrawal.

Remember to periodically re-evaluate your strategy based on changes in income, tax brackets, and life circumstances.

Now, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual situation.
