When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key principles:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** These accounts provide tax-deferred growth. This means you won't pay taxes on investment gains until you withdraw funds. It's often beneficial to contribute enough to get any employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after taxes, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they're realized. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Investments:** Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth investments, like stocks or mutual funds.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** If you have short-term savings goals, you might keep those funds in a taxable account or a high-yield savings account to ensure liquidity.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering asset classes, sectors, and geography. 

### 4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Think ahead about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. A mix of taxable and tax-deferred accounts can provide flexibility to manage your tax liability in retirement.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Max Your 401(k)** (especially to get matching contributions).
2. **Fund a Roth IRA** if you're eligible; it's beneficial for tax-free withdrawals.
3. **Fill Up Your Traditional IRA** after utilizing tax-advantaged accounts.
4. **Taxable Accounts** can be filled with investments that generate lower taxable income or capital gains.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 30%
- **Taxable Account:** 20%

Ultimately, your distribution strategy should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax strategy. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your situation.
