Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. The choice between these depends on whether you prefer tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).
   - If your income allows, aim to max out your IRA contributions ($6,500 annually, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older, as of 2023).

3. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit ($22,500 per year, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Finalize with Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged options, consider putting additional funds into a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility, though you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Align investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, higher-risk assets might be better suited for long-term growth accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs), while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

The specific distribution will vary based on personal circumstances, so consulting a financial advisor is always a good idea for tailored advice.
