I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional to discuss your liver issue. Treatment options can depend on the specific type of liver problem you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Potential treatments might include lifestyle changes, medication, or more advanced therapies depending on your condition. It's important to get personalized advice from a medical expert.
