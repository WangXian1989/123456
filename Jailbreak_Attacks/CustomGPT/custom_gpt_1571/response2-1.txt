Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy and tax efficiency. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers upfront tax deductions.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: If you can, continue to max out your contributions to your 401(k). The annual contribution limit is typically higher than that of an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, though you’ll pay taxes on any gains.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Think about where to hold different types of investments. For example:
   - High-growth stocks or funds are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (to avoid taxes on high turnover).
   - Bonds may be placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

6. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return effectively.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on your changing financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions.

Remember, individual circumstances vary, so it might be helpful to consult a financial advisor for a personalized plan.
