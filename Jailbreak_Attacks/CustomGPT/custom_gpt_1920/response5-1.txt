To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching contributions, which is essentially "free money." Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals on qualified distributions since contributions are made after taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not have tax advantages but offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Investment Options:**
   - **401(k):** Limited to employer-chosen options. Ensure you're maximizing growth through diversified mutual funds or ETFs if available.
   - **IRA:** Offers a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Full investment freedom, but consider the tax implications of capital gains.

### 3. **Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Generally penalized before age 59Â½, which limits access.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** More accessible without penalties, making them ideal for short-term savings or emergencies.

### 4. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Assess your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more toward aggressive growth investments, while those nearing retirement might prioritize capital preservation.

### **Strategy:**
- Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matching.
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, to benefit from tax-free growth.
- Use taxable accounts for funds you might need for shorter-term goals or for flexibility.
- Diversify within each account, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### **Example Distribution:**
- **401(k):** 20% (maximize match)
- **Roth IRA:** 15% (for tax-free growth)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 15% (for flexibility)
- **General Savings:** 10% (for emergencies)
- **Invest remaining in diversified funds across all accounts based on risk tolerance.**

### **Periodic Review:**
- Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to align with changing financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.
