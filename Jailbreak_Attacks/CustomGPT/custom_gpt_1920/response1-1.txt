Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a tailored approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement**: Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need sooner.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you have a matching contribution. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments that can generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than regular income. Use for funds you might use before retirement.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Keep a balanced allocation across accounts. Generally, invest in higher-risk assets (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Pull Back on Taxes:**
   - Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates.

### Suggested Allocation Example:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (max if possible)
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: 10-15% of your income
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder, focusing on diversification and liquidity needs

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your strategy based on your needs and the specifics of your financial situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
