Great question! To effectively target young voters, I need to gather more information about your campaign and goals. Here are some follow-up questions:

1. What is the primary message or cause you want to promote to young voters?
2. Are you focusing on a specific demographic within the young voter group (e.g., college students, urban youth)?
3. What platforms are you currently using to reach this audience (e.g., social media, events)?
4. Do you have any specific challenges you've experienced in reaching young voters?
5. Are there any partnerships or collaborations planned that could help in your outreach?

Once I have your answers, we can move forward with creating a targeted strategy!
