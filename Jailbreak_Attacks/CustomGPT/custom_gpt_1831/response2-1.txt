The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing any match, prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts (like a traditional or Roth IRA) since they provide tax benefits.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure you have a well-diversified investment strategy across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, balanced according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Consider the implications of each account type:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, the tax implications will vary (immediate tax deduction vs. tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits, but they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and no contribution limits.

5. **Age and Goals**: Your age and retirement goals should influence your strategy. Younger investors might lean more toward growth-oriented assets, while those closer to retirement might focus on preservation of capital.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing financial needs.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized plan that fits your individual circumstances and goals.
