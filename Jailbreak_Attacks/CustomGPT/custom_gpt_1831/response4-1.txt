To provide the best guidance, could you please share more details about your situation? Here are some follow-up questions to consider:

1. What are your retirement goals, and at what age do you plan to retire?
2. How much do you currently have in each account (401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts)?
3. Are you currently contributing to these accounts, and if so, how much per month?
4. What is your risk tolerance (e.g., conservative, moderate, aggressive)?
5. Are there any specific investment types or strategies you are interested in exploring?

Once I have this information, I can offer tailored advice for distributing your money across these accounts.
