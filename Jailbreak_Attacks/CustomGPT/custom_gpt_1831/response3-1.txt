To best distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to start saving.

2. **Utilize IRA Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). These accounts offer tax advantages, and your investments grow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth).

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting additional savings into a taxable investment account. This offers more flexibility in terms of withdrawal and investment options.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. Generally, stocks are suitable for long-term growth, while bonds or cash might be better for short-term needs.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of where you place certain investments. For example, tax-efficient investments may perform better in taxable accounts, while bonds might be better suited in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation is also advisable.
