Sure! To provide you with the best advice on distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, could you please provide me with more information about your financial situation? Here are some follow-up questions to get us started:

1. What is your age and current retirement savings goal?
2. Do you currently have a preference for any specific account type (401(k), IRA, taxable)?
3. Are you expecting any major financial changes in the near future, such as a job change or inheritance?
4. What is your risk tolerance (low, moderate, high)?
5. Are you currently contributing to any specific retirement accounts? If so, how much and how often? 

Once I have this information, I'll be able to assist you better!
