To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to secure this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Consider Tax Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, providing immediate tax benefits. Consider investing aggressively if you're younger and expect a higher income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met, making them ideal for younger investors. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility for withdrawals but might incur capital gains taxes. They can be ideal for savings not earmarked for retirement.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Allocate a larger portion to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth potential.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments since gains are taxed when realized.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all account types to mitigate risk and capture growth.

5. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**: Regularly contribute to each account according to your financial goals and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy that considers your specific financial situation and goals, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

By evaluating these factors, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your retirement goals.
