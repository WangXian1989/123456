To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits and Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Max out your employer's 401(k) match if available. This maximizes your contributions and takes advantage of pre-tax savings.
   - **IRA:** Choose between Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) based on your current tax situation and anticipated retirement tax bracket. Consider contributing the maximum allowed annually.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investment flexibility. Allocate funds here if youâ€™ve reached limits in tax-advantaged accounts or need liquidity.

### 2. **Strategic Asset Allocation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA):** Focus on investments with high growth potential (equities, REITs) as they benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate fixed income or high dividend yield investments here to manage capital gains and tax implications more effectively.

### 3. **Percentage Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Route Initial Cash Flow:**
     - 50% into 401(k) (up to match limit)
     - 25% into Roth IRA or Traditional IRA (prioritize based on tax situation)
     - 25% into taxable accounts for immediate access and diversification

### 4. **Rebalance and Adjust:**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to changes in tax laws or personal circumstances.

By utilizing these strategies, you can optimize your investment efforts to enhance growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.
