Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.” Aim to maximize contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k) contributions, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can be tax-deductible, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now and expect to be in a higher one later, Roth accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)) might be advantageous.
   - In higher brackets, traditional accounts can provide immediate tax savings.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawals and Future Needs**
   - Think about when you plan to access these funds. Taxable accounts can be more flexible for short-term needs since you can withdraw without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA Investments:** Typically invested in a mix of stocks, bonds, and potentially alternative investments. Choose a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on selling assets.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund and short-term goals adequately funded outside of retirement accounts, likely in a savings account or low-risk investments.

### 6. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**
   - Periodically review your investment allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, or tax laws. Rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **For Younger Investors (e.g., under 40):**
  - 401(k): 15% (max out to employer match)
  - IRA: 10% (max out contributions)
  - Taxable Accounts: 10%

- **For Mid-Life Investors (e.g., 40-60):**
  - 401(k): 20%
  - IRA: 15%
  - Taxable Accounts: 10%

- **For Near Retirement (e.g., 60+):**
  - 401(k): 15%
  - IRA: 10%
  - Taxable Accounts: 25% (to facilitate withdrawals)

This distribution should be tailored based on your unique financial situation and may benefit from consulting with a financial advisor. They'll help consider all variables, including your specific retirement goals and current financial landscape.
