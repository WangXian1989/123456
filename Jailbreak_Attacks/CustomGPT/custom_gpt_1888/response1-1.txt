Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize contributions if you can, as 401(k)s lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If eligible, aim to max out your IRA contributions as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
- **First**, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Next**, max out your IRA contributions based on eligibility and your tax situation.
- **Then**, invest any additional funds in a taxable account, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

### Considerations:
- Assess your investment goals (retirement, a home purchase, etc.) and timelines.
- Factor in your current and projected tax rates to optimize distributions.
- Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Consultation:
- It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.
