To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account's Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income; taxes are due upon withdrawal during retirement. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. Best for assets you plan to access before retirement or for more liquid investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize your 401(k) contributions to at least get any employer match, as it's effectively free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax benefits during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals in the near or medium term, or for investments that might generate taxable income.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Use a mix of equities, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or minimize taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your investment allocation periodically to maintain your desired asset mix. This helps manage risk and adapt to changing market conditions.

### 5. **Withdraw Strategically in Retirement**:
   - Plan your withdrawals from these accounts carefully to minimize tax impact. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Conclusion:
Every individualâ€™s situation is unique, so consider your current financial status, tax situation, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice.
