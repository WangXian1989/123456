Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Asset Location:** Place investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding bonds or other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Diversification and Liquidity Needs**
   - Ensure a balanced approach to asset allocation across all accounts.
   - Keep some liquidity in taxable accounts for unexpected needs or opportunities.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired allocation.
   - Adjust contributions based on changing income, tax laws, or market conditions.

### 5. **Consider Future Withdrawals**
   - Think about when you plan to access funds. Accounts will be taxed differently depending on whether you withdraw during retirement or before.

### Summary
A well-thought-out distribution among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and minimize tax liabilities. Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation is often beneficial for tailored advice.
