Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax when you sell assets. Consider keeping investments that you plan to hold long-term in these accounts, as they will benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes. Use fixed-income investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they can generate ordinary income and may be taxed at a higher rate.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments are well-diversified across your accounts to manage risk and return effectively.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Revisit your allocations and contributions annually or as your financial situation or goals change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider working with a financial planner who can help create a tailored strategy based on your circumstances.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investments while considering taxes and future income needs.
