(üîíNormal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: IRAs often provide tax benefits, especially traditional IRAs, which allow for tax-deductible contributions. Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility in accessing funds. These accounts have different tax implications, so be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance. This might involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing goals and market conditions.
