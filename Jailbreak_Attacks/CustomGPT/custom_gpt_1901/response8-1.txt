Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match if available, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income for the year. Consider contributing more if you're in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose between a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) and a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxes paid on withdrawals). This decision largely depends on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and utilize them fully if it aligns with your goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals, as funds are more accessible without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient securities (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an adequate emergency fund in easily accessible accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes to manage risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Revisit your allocations periodically and adjust according to your changing goals or market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be beneficial to discuss your individual situation with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Effective distribution combines these elements based on your unique financial landscape and future plans.
