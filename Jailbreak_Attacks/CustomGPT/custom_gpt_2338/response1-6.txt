3. **Encourage Engagement**: Use interactive campaigns, such as polls, contests, and challenges that invite participation and feedback.

4. **Leverage Influencers**: Partner with relatable figures and influencers who can authentically connect with the younger demographic.

5. **Offer Easy Access to Information**: Simplify the voting process with clear, concise information on how to register and vote. Utilize apps or websites that make this process straightforward.

6. **Host Events and Activations**: Engage in grassroots organizing through events, concerts, or community gatherings that promote civic engagement and make voting a social activity.
