The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), affecting your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Tax Diversification:** Consider both traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free in retirement) IRAs depending on your current tax rate versus expected rate in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over age 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity:** Use these for funds you may need before retirement, as they allow for more flexibility without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Aim to contribute at least enough to secure any employer match.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you can, add to a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match, especially if your employer offers a limited match.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings, focusing on capital gains and dividend tax strategies.

### Overall Mix:
- **Aggressive Growth (younger ages):** More in 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits; some in taxable for liquidity.
- **Balanced Approach (mid-career):** Shift toward a mix of all three, maintaining tax advantages while building liquidity.
- **Conservative (pre-retirement):** Gradually move to safer investments; ensure you have access to funds without penalties.

### Final Considerations:
- **Regular Review:** Reassess your strategy annually based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can help optimize your unique situation and ensure tax efficiency.
