Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Roth IRA Contributions**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA. The tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement can be beneficial, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**
   - If you still have funds after maximizing your Roth, consider traditional IRA contributions. This can also provide tax advantages depending on your income.

### 4. **Max Out the 401(k)**
   - After you’ve handled the Roth and traditional IRAs, put additional funds into your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This reduces your taxable income.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially if you're likely to need cash before retirement. These accounts offer more flexibility in withdrawals.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax in taxable accounts. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help manage taxes.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

#### Final Note
It’s advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances.
