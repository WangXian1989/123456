When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Here’s a general guide to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Assess Your Goals:** 
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a house, education, or something else?

2. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA:** Provides tax advantages for retirement savings. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offer flexibility in withdrawal and investment choices, but any interest, dividends, and capital gains are subject to taxes.

3. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts.
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before putting money into a taxable account. 

4. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (with an additional catch-up contribution for those over 50), and the limit for an IRA is $6,500 (with a catch-up of $1,000 for those over 50).

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax bracket. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth contributions.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and any shifts in your retirement plans.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you are unsure about your investment strategy or need personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can give tailored guidance.

By following these steps, you can strategically allocate your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts based on your individual circumstances and financial goals.
