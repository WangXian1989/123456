To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Investment Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a purchase, or building wealth?

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning you'll pay taxes when you withdraw the money in retirement. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages but offer flexibility. You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

3. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere, as it's essentially free money.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when you plan to access your funds. Taxable accounts can provide liquidity for short-term needs, while retirement accounts are meant for long-term growth.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (plus catch-up contributions if over 50), $6,500 for IRAs (with a higher limit for those over 50), and there are no limits on taxable accounts.

7. **Investment Fees**: Look at the fees associated with each account type. Sometimes, investment options in a 401(k) may have higher fees than those in an IRA or taxable account.

A balanced approach might involve maxing out your employerâ€™s 401(k) match, contributing to an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible), and then using taxable accounts for additional savings or investments beyond those limits.

Given these factors, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to your unique situation.
