Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain conditions, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Taxable accounts should generally be used for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability. Avoid holding bonds or high-yield investments in taxable accounts due to higher tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. You might have more aggressive investments in your 401(k) or IRA due to tax advantages, while keeping safer investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: Assess when you plan to retire. If you expect to retire early, prioritize allocating funds to accounts that offer more flexibility and tax advantages, such as a Roth IRA.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your future withdrawal strategy. Some investors plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax and investment strategies, a financial advisor can help create a tailored plan that aligns with your personal situation and goals.

It's essential to review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly as your financial situation and tax laws change.
