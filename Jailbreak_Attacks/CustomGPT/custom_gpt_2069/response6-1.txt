Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a streamlined approach to help you decide:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA as these accounts offer tax benefits. 

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. It may be wise to keep investments that typically incur lower tax rates (like index funds) in these accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Funds for retirement should generally go into tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential without immediate tax consequences. 
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Money needed in the near future (e.g., for a home down payment) may be better allocated in taxable accounts for more accessible liquidity.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Diversification:** Ensure that your investment strategy is balanced across all accounts. You can use different investment vehicles based on the accounts—higher risk in tax-advantaged accounts where taxes won’t apply until withdrawal.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize employer 401(k) matching contributions.**
- **Max out IRA contributions if eligible.**
- **Utilize taxable accounts for short-term liquidity and lower-tax investments.**

As always, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution strategy to your unique situation.
