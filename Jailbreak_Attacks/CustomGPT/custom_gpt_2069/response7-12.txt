I'm sorry to hear that you're having liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized medical advice based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medication, or in more severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through regular blood tests and medical check-ups.
4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions that contribute to liver problems, such as diabetes or obesity.

Always discuss any treatment plan with your healthcare provider to ensure it's suitable for your case.
