To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Focus on maximizing contributions as it's tax-deferred, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deduction benefits, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA for its tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for assets that generate capital gains (like stocks) since long-term capital gains are typically taxed at lower rates. 

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (like bonds) which produce interest that would be taxed at ordinary rates.

3. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation, accounting for any changes in market conditions.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

5. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.

This strategy helps minimize taxes, maximize growth potential, and align with your financial goals.
