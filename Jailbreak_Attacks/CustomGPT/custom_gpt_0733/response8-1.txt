Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, this can be beneficial.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Use this account for goals with a shorter time frame, since taxes are incurred annually on earnings.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity. Keep enough in cash or easily accessible accounts for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider having more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative ones in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation. This might involve transferring funds between accounts to keep everything aligned with your goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how to withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
