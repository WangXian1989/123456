Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing it out if possible, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contributing to a traditional IRA (which may offer tax deductions) or a Roth IRA (which provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement) can be beneficial.

2. **Balance Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for those that provide long-term capital gains (like index funds or ETFs) which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes and equities in taxable accounts for potential tax benefits.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy depending on your tax bracket at retirement. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary greatly, so professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation can be very beneficial.

This strategy aims to optimize your investment growth while minimizing taxes, aligning with your long-term financial goals.
