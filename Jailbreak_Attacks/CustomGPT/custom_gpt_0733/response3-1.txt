The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now.

3. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Balancing contributions between tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and after-tax accounts (Roth IRA) can provide flexibility in retirement withdrawal strategies.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any money beyond your tax-advantaged contributions can go into a taxable account. This can be useful for short- to medium-term goals since you can access it without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, you might choose more aggressive investments, whereas taxable accounts could hold more conservative investments to minimize tax impacts on gains.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution annually to adjust for changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.
