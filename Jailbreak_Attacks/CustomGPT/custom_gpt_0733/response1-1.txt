Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Retirement Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum matching contribution. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA to enjoy tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for money you might want to access before retirement.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your immediate vs. long-term goals. Retirement accounts are typically for long-term savings, while taxable accounts can be more flexible for shorter-term needs.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your financial horizon.

5. **Revisit & Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions, changes in income, and life events.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is personalized, so consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.
