(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, a balanced approach is recommended: 

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the annual limit depending on your budget.
2. **IRA**: Funding a Traditional or Roth IRA can also be beneficial due to tax advantages. Choose based on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or more liquid investments; it's also a good place for investments with favorable capital gains treatment.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: First off, max out that employer match! Itâ€™s like finding cash in your couch cushions! After that, throw in as much as you can up to the limitâ€”your future self will thank you while sipping margaritas on the beach.
2. **IRA**: Dive into a Roth IRA if you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket when you retireâ€”tax-free growth? Yes, please! If you prefer the tax break now, go for a Traditional IRA. 
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Keep some dough here for treating yourself now or for those short-term goals. Itâ€™s all about liquidity, my friend!
