Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you may need access to before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate funds based on risk tolerance across all accounts. For retirement accounts, consider a mix of stocks and bonds according to your age and risk comfort.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts, ideally 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Automate contributions to all accounts to build wealth consistently over time.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
