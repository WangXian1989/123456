Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves careful planning based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals. 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need short-term or for investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 3. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Hold higher growth assets (like stocks) here to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals by periodically reviewing and adjusting your distributions.

### 5. **Withdrawals Strategy**
   - When it comes time to withdraw, strategize which account to withdraw from first to minimize taxes (often starting with taxable, then tax-deferred, then tax-free accounts).

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailored advice can help optimize your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.

### Summary
Start with employer matches in your 401(k), then contribute to IRAs, and use taxable accounts for flexibility. Focus on tax-efficient investment placement and adjust regularly.
