To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Choose between traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (post-tax). Roth IRAs grow tax-free, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Useful for short-term goals or if you exceed contribution limits for retirement accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, index funds).
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, consider a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA annually. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (under 50).

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account before aggressively investing.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If unsure, consider getting personalized advice from a financial professional.

### Summary
Aim to maximize retirement accounts while maintaining flexibility in taxable accounts for immediate access and taxation strategies.
