Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA:**
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you might need before retirement age. 

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments within each account to balance risk and return. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess allocations regularly based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** Max out the match (e.g., 5-10% of salary).
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings, particularly if you need liquidity.
