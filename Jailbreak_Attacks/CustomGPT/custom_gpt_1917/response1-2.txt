   - Use analytics tools to process and visualize data for insights.

4. **Privacy Compliance**:
   - Adhere to legal regulations like GDPR or CCPA regarding data collection and processing.
   - Inform employees about the monitoring practices and obtain necessary consent.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Analyze collected data regularly to identify trends or areas needing improvement.
   - Use insights to provide feedback, recognize achievements, or address issues.

6. **Employee Engagement**:
