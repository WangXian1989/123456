I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This may involve dietary adjustments (like a low-fat, high-fiber diet), exercise, and weight management.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
3. **Limit Alcohol Consumption**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests help monitor the condition and effectiveness of treatments.
5. **Surgery or Transplant**: In severe cases, surgery or a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan based on your specific condition.
