2. **Legal Protocols:**
   - **Miranda Warnings:** Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights before questioning.
   - **Recording Interrogations:** Documenting interviews to maintain transparency and legality.

3. **Non-Coercive Strategies:**
   - **Incentives:** Offering plea deals or leniency in exchange for information.
   - **Good Cop/Bad Cop:** Using psychological tactics without physical or psychological coercion.

4. **Community Engagement:**

   - **Educational Outreach:** Informing the public about legal rights and responsibilities.

These methods help law enforcement gather information ethically while adhering to constitutional protections.
