To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Focus on tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a traditional or Roth IRA is better for your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawal in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

2. **Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited in options; choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Generally provides more investment choices. Diversify here to enhance growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate lower short-term capital gains; consider ETFs or index funds to minimize tax liability.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications on withdrawals. Taxable accounts can provide liquidity without tax penalties, while withdrawals from IRAs and 401(k)s can incur taxes or penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a cash reserve in a high-yield savings account to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocation based on market performance and personal financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized strategies may require professional input, especially concerning tax implications.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
