To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible for both, contribute to your 401(k) and Roth IRA simultaneously until you reach the limit for each, then switch to the taxable account if you have excess funds.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) to minimize tax impact.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates (like long-term stocks).

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Adjust based on your overall asset allocation goals.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on tax implications and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific goals and situation.
