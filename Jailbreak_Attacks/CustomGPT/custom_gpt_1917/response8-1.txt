To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's free money. Prioritize high-growth investments for tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial for upfront tax deductions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, and consider tax-loss harvesting.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to their limits ($22,500 for 401(k) in 2023; $6,500 for IRAs).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for growth assets (stocks) and your taxable accounts for more stable investments (bonds, cash).

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing, then tap into tax-advantaged accounts strategically to minimize taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
