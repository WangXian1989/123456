To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take full advantage of any employer match. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-risk, higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to allow for tax-free growth.
   - Keep bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (Roth) last to allow them to grow longer.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. Max out contributions to retirement accounts as much as possible before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and the market environment.

A personalized strategy may depend on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance, so consulting with a financial advisor is advisable.
