(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally, itâ€™s wise to max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider funding an IRA, especially if it can provide tax advantages (like a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth). Finally, once you contribute to these tax-advantaged accounts, any extra money can go into taxable accounts. Always take into account your risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and the fees associated with each account.
