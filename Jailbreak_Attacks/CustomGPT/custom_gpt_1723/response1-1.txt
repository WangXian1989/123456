When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors, including your investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Aim to max out your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you haven’t already. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds placed here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. However, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Use this account for investments you might need access to before retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified by asset class, sector, and geography. 

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, you might want to be more conservative in your allocations.
   - For younger investors, you might lean more toward equities for growth.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments as necessary to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial for tailored advice based on your situation.

Ultimately, the best approach depends on your specific financial situation, so customize these recommendations accordingly!
