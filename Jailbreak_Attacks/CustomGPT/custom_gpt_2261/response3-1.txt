To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. This can provide tax benefits either now or in the future.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Ideal for higher-income individuals now, as contributions lower taxable income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Great for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as long-term capital gains may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate assets across different accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For example:
     - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stock and bond funds suitable for your retirement timeline.
     - **IRA**: Similar strategy, but consider alternatives like index funds or ETFs.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs, focusing on long-term growth.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal financial situations vary greatly. A professional can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.

In summary, maximize your contributions, be mindful of tax implications, diversify your investments, and consider professional advice for tailored guidance.
