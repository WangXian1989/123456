It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid processed foods, alcohol, and high-fat meals.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Supplements**: Certain supplements, like milk thistle, may support liver health, but consult your doctor before taking any.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging may be needed to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limit exposure to harmful substances like alcohol, certain medications, and environmental toxins.

6. **Supportive Care**: For chronic liver diseases, monitoring for complications like cirrhosis is necessary.

7. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options, including liver transplantation, may be considered.

Always work with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your specific condition.
