The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and liquidity in case you need funds before retirement.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, retirement accounts can be more aggressive since withdrawals occur much later.

### 5. **Tax Implications**:
   - Be aware of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Favor long-term capital gains when possible.

### 6. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Review your distribution annually or when significant financial changes occur to adjust your strategy as needed.

### Conclusion:
Each situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
