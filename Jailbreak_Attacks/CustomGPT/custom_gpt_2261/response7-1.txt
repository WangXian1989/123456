Determining how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 401(k) Accounts
- **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
- **Consider Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Roth options provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### IRA Accounts
- **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Good for reducing current taxable income.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **Maximize Contributions**: Try to max out your IRA contributions annually if possible.

### Taxable Accounts
- **Use for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts are great for short-term goals or as emergency funds since you can access the funds without penalties.
- **Consider Capital Gains**: Be mindful of how investments are taxed in taxable accounts. Favor long-term investments to take advantage of lower rates on capital gains.

### General Strategy
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
2. **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on distributions, while holding more stable investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
3. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals, consider consulting a financial advisor.

### Summary
- Prioritize employer match in your 401(k).
- Maximize contributions to both an IRA and 401(k).
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and shorter-term goals.

By focusing on these aspects, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that meets your long-term financial needs.
