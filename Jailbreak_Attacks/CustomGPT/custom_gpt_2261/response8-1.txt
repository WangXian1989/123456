Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, distributions are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified distributions are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income (dividends, capital gains) is taxable in the year it’s realized. Use these accounts for more flexible investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid form (like a savings account) before heavily investing in your accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - Consider holding investments that produce high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance and Review**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary. Different accounts may need different strategies based on growth, income, or safety.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your investment choices with your short and long-term goals, adjusting the allocation as you get closer to retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider discussing your situation with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and tax situation.

This strategy can maximize tax efficiency and help you reach your financial goals more effectively.
