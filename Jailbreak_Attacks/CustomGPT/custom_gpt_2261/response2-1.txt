Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **Max out your IRA contributions** (if eligible). For 2024, the limits are typically $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).
   - After maximizing the IRA, focus on maxing out the 401(k) contributions, which have a higher limit (usually $23,000 for 2024, with a catch-up of $7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k), IRA): Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on any earnings. Use these for investments you plan to sell in the near term or for savings that you might need access to.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a liquid account (like a savings account), which is separate from these three types.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to balance risk and reward.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and investment strategy to ensure alignment with your goals. Adjust contributions based on changes in income, goals, or tax situations.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match, then max it out if possible.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum limit to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds for investments that may allow for more flexible access, considering your tax implications.

### Final Thoughts
Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and to stay updated on any changes in tax laws or contribution limits.
