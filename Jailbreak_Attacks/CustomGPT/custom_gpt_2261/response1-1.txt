Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here. If you’re under 50, the 2023 limit is $22,500; if over, it's $30,000.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA. You can contribute up to $6,500 per year (or $7,500 if over 50). Depending on your income, either a Traditional or Roth IRA could provide tax advantages.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility. They don’t have contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, but you're taxed on dividends and capital gains. Consider holding investments that produce lower taxable income in these accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments to spread risk. Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Consider dollar-cost averaging by regularly contributing to all accounts, regardless of market conditions.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance tailored to your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This strategy aims to balance tax efficiency with growth potential while considering individual circumstances.
