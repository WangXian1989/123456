Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can, up to the limit. This reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Open a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income level and tax projections. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. In these, you may have more flexibility but will owe taxes on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk assets (stocks) are suitable for the long-term, while more stable assets (bonds) might be better suited for near-term needs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation.

Achieving a balanced distribution can optimize both growth potential and tax efficiency.
