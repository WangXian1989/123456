Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Contribute the maximum if possible.

2. **Tax Planning:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions may reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any gains are subject to capital gains tax; consider holding investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term rates.

3. **Investment Timeframe:**
   - For short-term goals, lean more towards cash or stable investments in taxable accounts.
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), focus on growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts where taxes on gains can be deferred.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as necessary to maintain your target distribution.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize tax efficiency and improve your overall financial security.
