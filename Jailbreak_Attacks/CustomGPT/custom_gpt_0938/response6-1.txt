Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for potential tax-deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains, as they are usually taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income. 
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Keep bonds and income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) to minimize immediate tax liabilities.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Use individual accounts for more speculative investments while maintaining stability in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity Needs**
   - Maintain a sufficient cash reserve in taxable accounts for emergencies while ensuring that retirement accounts remain untouched until necessary.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Consider your potential tax bracket in retirement. Strategies like withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help manage taxable income over time.

### Conclusion
Regularly review your allocation and make adjustments based on market performance, changes in income, and evolving retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
