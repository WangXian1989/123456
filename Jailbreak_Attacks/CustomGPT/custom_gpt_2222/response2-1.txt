Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). If possible, aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a Roth or traditional IRA fits your situation better. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be beneficial, allowing you to lock in lower taxes on future withdrawals.
   - If you're currently in a higher tax bracket, contributing to a traditional IRA or 401(k) can reduce your taxable income.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals or if you expect to need access to funds earlier than retirement accounts allow.
   - Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Consider asset location; hold more volatile assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable ones to minimize tax implications.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess and adjust allocations based on performance and changes in your goals or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) for any employer match, complement this with an IRA, and then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and opportunity. Tailor your specific strategies to your unique financial situation and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
