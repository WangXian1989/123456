Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before investing.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **401(k) Contributions**
   - Contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) if it offers good investment options and low fees.

### 4. **IRA Contributions**
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. 
   - If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed before retirement, or for investments not suited for tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., certain bonds).

### 6. **Asset Allocation**
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max out up to the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute up to the annual limit.
3. **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings can go here, focusing on long-term, tax-efficient investments.

### Considerations:
- **Age**: Younger investors can be more aggressive, while those nearing retirement may prioritize safer investments.
- **Income Level**: Higher earners may prefer maxing out tax-advantaged accounts to lower taxable income.
