Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**  
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**  
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower taxable income but taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Roth allows tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs defer taxes until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so consider holding tax-efficient investments here.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**  
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments that may incur more taxes when sold, like stocks.
   - Hold more stable investments, such as bonds, in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Diversification**  
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**  
   - Regularly assess your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific circumstances.
