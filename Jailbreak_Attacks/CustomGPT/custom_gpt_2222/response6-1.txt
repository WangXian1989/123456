To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k):** Generally focus on higher-growth investments, like stocks, since taxes on growth are deferred.
   - **IRA:** Balance tax-sensitive investments; prefer bonds or dividend-paying stocks if it's a traditional IRA, for lower current tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to minimize tax impact on tax-deferred accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Regularly adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals to maintain your desired risk level.

### Final Tips:
- Consult a financial advisor to personalize strategies based on your unique financial situation and goals.
- Stay informed about tax laws as they can change, impacting your investment strategies. 

This approach will optimize growth potential and minimize tax liabilities over time.
