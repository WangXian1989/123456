To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth) for its tax advantages. A Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed out your IRA, direct additional funds into your 401(k). If you have the option for a Roth 401(k), consider this for tax diversification.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to funds. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Hold income-generating assets (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance as necessary to maintain your target allocation based on risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice to align with your long-term financial goals.
