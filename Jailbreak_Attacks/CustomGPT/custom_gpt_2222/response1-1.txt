Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits of IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, since these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider keeping more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Each account type can hold different asset classes depending on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw money in retirement. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) will be taxed at your ordinary income rate, while Roth withdrawals will be tax-free.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
A common strategy is to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k), then IRA), and then consider taxable accounts for additional savings. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.
