Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax Strategies**: Be mindful of the types of investments you keep in each account (e.g., high-yield bonds and REITs might be better in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates).

3. **Investment Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be used for emergency funds or short-term goals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across all accounts to balance risk. Each account type can hold various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on market performance, financial goals, and changes in your life circumstances (like income or retirement plans).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help you align your investment strategy with your financial goals and tax situation.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and considering the tax implications of your investments, you can optimize your overall portfolio effectively.
