Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching (401(k))**
   - **Start with your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Increase contributions to your 401(k)** up to the annual limit, especially if you've received the match.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use taxable accounts for additional funds**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify your investments**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across stocks, bonds, and other assets, tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Continuous Review**
   - **Rebalance your portfolio**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 7. **Tax Implications**
   - **Be mindful of tax implications in taxable accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often involves maximizing contributions to retirement accounts first, followed by investing in a taxable account as excess funds allow. Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
