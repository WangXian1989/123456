When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA**: A Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs give you immediate tax breaks. Choose based on your current tax bracket versus expected tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversify Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for investments you may need access to before retirement. They provide flexibility but less tax efficiency. Consider holding investments with lower turnover (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like growth stocks) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, and use taxable accounts for more stable investments that generate income (like bonds) to manage tax liabilities.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, lifestyle, and market performance. Regularly reassess your allocation strategy to align with your financial goals.

This balanced approach allows you to make the most of tax advantages, while also safeguarding against various financial needs. Make sure to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual situation.
