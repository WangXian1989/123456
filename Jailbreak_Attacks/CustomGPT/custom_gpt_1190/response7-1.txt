Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Tax Deferral:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Aim to maximize your contributions (up to the annual limit).

### 2. **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:**
   - **Tax Strategy:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. If you think your tax rate will increase, a Roth IRA (where contributions are taxed upfront but grow tax-free) may be better.
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to fully fund your IRA if possible, as these accounts often have higher growth potential due to tax advantages.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Access:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement (e.g., saving for a home or other significant expenses).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxation. You can also consider tax-loss harvesting strategies in years of market downturns.

### 4. **General Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Allocate a higher percentage to stocks in your 401(k) and IRAs when you're younger, shifting to a more conservative mix as you approach retirement.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments are spread across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.
   - **Regular Review:** Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, including your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor could help tailor a plan specifically for you.
