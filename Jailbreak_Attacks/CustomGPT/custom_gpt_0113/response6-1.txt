Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. Focus on maximizing contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out the 401(k), contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower tax liabilities, such as:
     - **Index funds or ETFs**: Generally lower turnover and long-term capital gains.
     - **Tax-efficient funds**: Designed to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Considerations:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in liquid cash.
   - **Investment Goals:** Align your asset allocation with your timeline for needs (retirement, purchasing a home, etc.).

### 4. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically reassess contributions and allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

This balanced approach helps you leverage the tax benefits of each account type while maintaining flexibility.
