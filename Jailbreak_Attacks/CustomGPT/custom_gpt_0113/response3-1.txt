Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and you benefit from tax-deferred growth. Aim to max out employer matching if available.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax situation and future expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax. Consider using this for short-term savings or investments with lower tax implications.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your account allocations with your retirement timeline. Long-term growth funds might be more suitable for a 401(k) and IRA, while taxable accounts could hold more liquid investments.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to reduce risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Tax implications differ based on account type.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each type of account. Prioritize contributions based on your overall retirement strategy.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (especially if it’s a Roth).
3. **Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts**, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Periodic Review:
Regularly reassess your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, and shifts in your retirement goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
