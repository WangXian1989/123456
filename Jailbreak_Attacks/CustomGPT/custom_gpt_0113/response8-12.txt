I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoiding alcohol and reducing intake of fatty foods.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications, like diuretics for fluid retention.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
