Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, investment goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum amount to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax strategy.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These grow tax-free until withdrawal. Prioritize these for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower potential taxes, such as index funds, or for more liquid needs.

### 3. **Asset Allocation by Account Type**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for bonds or dividend stocks to manage tax bills efficiently.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your investments based on performance and your changing risk tolerance or goals.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider your future tax bracket when planning withdrawals. Generally, prioritize withdrawing from taxable accounts first in retirement.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15% of paycheck
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining funds for flexibility and liquidity.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual situation.
