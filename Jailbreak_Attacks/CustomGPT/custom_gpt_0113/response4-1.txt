Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it offers free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions reduce your taxable income; Roth contributions grow tax-free. Choose based on your tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k); consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you need access to before retirement or for investments that generate favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments due to tax advantages.
   - **Taxable**: Hold more conservative, income-generating investments to manage tax obligations.

5. **Regular Review**: Adjust your distribution as your income level, tax situation, and retirement timeline change.

By balancing contributions according to these principles, you optimize your tax situation and prepare for retirement effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances.
