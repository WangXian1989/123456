To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You will pay capital gains tax on any profits when selling investments.

3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments that will grow over time. Stocks or mutual funds can be good options here.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments you may need to access sooner.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within all accounts to spread risk.

5. **Adjust for Time Horizon**:
   - If retirement is many years away, a more aggressive allocation (higher equity) may be suitable.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.
