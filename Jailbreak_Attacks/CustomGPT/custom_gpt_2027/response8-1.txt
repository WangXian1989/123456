Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k), IRA) to maximize tax-advantaged savings.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on any capital gains and dividends annually.

4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider keeping higher-growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: These accounts can provide liquidity and access to funds without penalties, making them useful for short-term goals.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your contributions and asset allocations to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
