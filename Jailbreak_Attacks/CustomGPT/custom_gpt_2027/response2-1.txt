Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing more to your 401(k), focusing on pre-tax contributions to reduce your taxable income.

4. **Fully Fund Traditional IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions to a traditional IRA, which can provide additional tax benefits.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in a taxable account for short- to medium-term goals or to maintain liquidity. This is especially useful for goals outside of retirement.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes, aligning with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Tax-Efficient Investments**: In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

8. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust contributions as needed.
