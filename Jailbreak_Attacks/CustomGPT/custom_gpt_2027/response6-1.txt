Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, depending on your eligibility for tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income or for funds you'll need in the short term. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Adjust based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking tax implications into account.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) for accounts like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs after age 72.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions and investments across these accounts is crucial for effective wealth growth and tax management. Regularly assess your financial situation and adjust your strategy as needed. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
