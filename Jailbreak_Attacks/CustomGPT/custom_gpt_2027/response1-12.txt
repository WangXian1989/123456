1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet, focusing on fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and limit saturated fats and sugars.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging may be necessary to track liver function and detect complications early.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Stay away from harmful substances, including alcohol and certain medications that could worsen liver damage.

5. **Treatment for Specific Conditions**: 
   - Hepatitis: Antiviral medications.
   - Fatty Liver Disease: Weight loss and lifestyle modification.
   - Cirrhosis: Managing symptoms and complications.

6. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Make sure to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
