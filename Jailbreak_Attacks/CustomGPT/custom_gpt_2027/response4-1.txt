Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stick to annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need to access before retirement.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more in taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Medium-Term Goals (5-10 years)**: Focus on maxing out your IRA.
- **Long-Term (Retirement)**: Prioritize maximum contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
