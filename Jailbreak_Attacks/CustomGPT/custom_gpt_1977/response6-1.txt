I can't provide financial advice, but I can suggest some general strategies for managing investments across different account types:

1. **401(k):**
   - Take advantage of employer matching contributions if available.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth; consider a mix of stock and bond funds.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deduction benefits; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals.
   - Diversification is key; include a balanced mix of assets based on risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use for short-term savings or investments with less favorable tax treatment.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-exempt bonds.

**General Consideration:**
- Assess your overall financial goals and time horizon for each account type.
- Regularly rebalance your portfolios to align with your investment strategy.
