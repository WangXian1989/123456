To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If you can contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, prioritize this after maximizing your 401(k) match.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Hold higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Income Investments**: Keep income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to utilize lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings outside these accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced asset allocation across accounts to guard against market volatility.

5. **Regular Assessments**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider seeking guidance from a financial professional.

This strategic approach can help you optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
