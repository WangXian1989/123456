Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize employer match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is often considered "free money."
   - **Tax-deferred growth:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Focus on long-term growth and risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; you pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals later. A Traditional IRA may be better if you want the tax deduction now.
   - **Diversification:** Use IRAs to invest in a diversified portfolio, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs suited to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide easier access to funds without penalties, making them good for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax-efficient investing:** Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains and tax-efficient funds.

### **General Tips**
- **Prioritize contributions based on matching, tax benefits, and liquidity needs.**
- **Rebalance your portfolio regularly:** Different accounts may have different asset allocations over time.
- **Consider your overall tax situation:** Place high-growth, tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
