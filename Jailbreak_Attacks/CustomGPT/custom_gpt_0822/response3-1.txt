Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility.
   - If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexible Access**:
   - If you're near retirement or need liquidity, consider investing excess funds in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (stocks).
   - Hold bonds and less-tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Remember that withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income. Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help you find the best allocation based on your unique situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth and minimize taxes over time.
