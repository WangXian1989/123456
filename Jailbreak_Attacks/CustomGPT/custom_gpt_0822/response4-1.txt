Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 (2023), plus $7,500 catch-up if over 50.
     - **IRA:** $6,500 (2023), plus $1,000 catch-up if over 50.

### 3. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider taxable accounts for additional savings.
   - Use these accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Regular Portfolio Review**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor to create a tailored investment strategy based on your unique situation.

This strategy helps optimize growth while managing tax implications across different account types.
