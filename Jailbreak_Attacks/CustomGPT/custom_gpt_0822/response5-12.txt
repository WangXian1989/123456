I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with liver function tests can help monitor the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary, especially for conditions like liver cancer or gallstones.

5. **Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a liver transplant might be the only option.

Always discuss treatment options with your doctor to determine the best plan for your situation.
