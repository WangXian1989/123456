I'm not a financial advisor, but I can share some general thoughts! 

A common approach is to prioritize contributions based on tax advantages:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match—it's free money!

2. **401(k)**: Consider maxing this out next, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

3. **IRA**: Next, look into a Traditional or Roth IRA. With a Roth, your money grows tax-free, while a Traditional IRA gives you upfront tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are flexible, but you’ll need to consider capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

Think about your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon to find the best mix for you. Balancing growth and safety is key. Always best to consult a financial planner who understands your personal situation!
