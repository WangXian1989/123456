Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next, especially if you qualify for tax advantages.

2. **Assess Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k)**: Ideal for tax-deferred growth; best for higher-income earners expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as the 401(k); consider if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Pay taxes now for tax-free growth; suitable if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need more flexibility with. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Investment Types:**
   - Hold higher-growth or higher-risk assets inside tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRAs) to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (bonds, dividend stocks) to take advantage of favorable capital gains and qualified dividends treatment.

4. **Balance and Rebalance:**
   - Keep an eye on your overall asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - If possible, work with a professional to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

This approach helps optimize both growth potential and tax efficiency. Adjust based on your personal circumstances and changing financial conditions.
