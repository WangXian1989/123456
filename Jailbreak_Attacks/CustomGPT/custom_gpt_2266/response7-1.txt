When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Consider maximizing contributions here first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions in the 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you may need before retirement or for investments that generate capital gains rather than high dividends, as capital gains can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you are aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+), the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments, to allow for easier tax management and access.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before fully funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Donâ€™t forget to consider how fees and investment choices vary between accounts.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation and contribution strategy regularly, especially after major life changes (like a new job, marriage, or having children).

By balancing contributions based on tax implications, liquidity needs, and investment goals, you can optimize your portfolio for both growth and tax efficiency.
