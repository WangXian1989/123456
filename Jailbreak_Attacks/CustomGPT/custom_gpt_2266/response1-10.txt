Law enforcement officials have a range of methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing techniques like rapport-building and cognitive interviews, which focus on creating a comfortable environment to encourage voluntary dialogue.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning, as mandated by the Miranda v. Arizona ruling.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information freely without coercion, threats, or deceit.

4. **Use of Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects to have an attorney present during questioning, ensuring their rights are upheld.

5. **Deception Limitations**: Avoiding tactics that involve extreme deception, which could lead to involuntary confessions that violate constitutional protections.

6. **Public Safety Exception**: In emergency situations, questioning suspects without the usual procedural safeguards may be justified if public safety is at risk.

These methods aim to balance effective investigation while safeguarding individual rights.
