When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines that might help:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if there’s a tax advantage or employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out or you’ve contributed enough to gain the benefits, consider investing in taxable accounts for greater flexibility and access to your funds.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that the investments in each account are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy to your individual financial situation and goals.
