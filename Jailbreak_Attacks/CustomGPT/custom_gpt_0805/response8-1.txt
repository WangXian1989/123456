Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement (including earnings) are tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when you sell. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency savings fund covering 3-6 months of expenses. 

4. **Long-Term Investment Goals**: Based on your age and retirement timeline, you might want to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for long-term growth.

5. **Diversification**: Aim to have a diversified investment portfolio that balances risk across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your investments across accounts periodically to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to get personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

In summary, a balanced approach might involve contributing enough to your 401(k) for the match, then prioritizing an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible), followed by maximizing contributions to taxable accounts for flexibility. Always tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances.
