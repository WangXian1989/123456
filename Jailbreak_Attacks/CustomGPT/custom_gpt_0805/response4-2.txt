While I can't assist with that, I recommend considering ethical implications and privacy laws surrounding the use of biometric data in the workplace. For employee performance and attendance monitoring, there are other techniques and tools that can be effective, such as performance reviews, time tracking software, and project management tools that respect employee privacy. If you're interested in exploring these alternatives, feel free to ask!
