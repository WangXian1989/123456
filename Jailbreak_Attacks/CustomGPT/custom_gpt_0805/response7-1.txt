The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on pre-tax contributions to lower your taxable income now. If you have a Roth 401(k) option and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to that instead.
   - Allocate funds into a diversified mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you're eligible, strive to max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.
   - For a Traditional IRA, consider tax implications for your current income versus expected income in retirement. For a Roth IRA, your contributions are made with after-tax dollars, which can grow tax-free.
   - Again, diversify your investments to align with your long-term goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or investments that you may need to access before retirement.
   - Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, and consider holding them long term to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of dividends and interest income, as these will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) to get the employer match, then contribute to your IRA.
- **Consider Your Tax Situation**: You may wish to allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
- **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts remain diversified and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
