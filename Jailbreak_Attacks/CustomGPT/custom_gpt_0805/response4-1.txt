To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Investment growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. However, you have flexibility with withdrawals at any time without penalties.

2. **Retirement Goals**: 
   - Assess your retirement timeline and goals. If you're younger and won't need funds for a while, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs). 

3. **Employer Match**:
   - Maximize any employer match offered in your 401(k) before contributing to IRAs or taxable accounts, as it's essentially free money.

4. **Investment Horizon**:
   - Consider the time until you need to access the funds. Long-term investments can tolerate more volatility and are suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while accounts for short-term goals should be more liquid and safer.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across account types. Different accounts can hold different asset types based on their tax implications.

6. **Max Contribution Limits**:
   - Take full advantage of annual contribution limits for each account type. This will help grow your retirement savings more efficiently.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you would withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and leave Roth accounts for last to minimize tax liabilities.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may benefit you to consult with a financial professional who can offer personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

Tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
