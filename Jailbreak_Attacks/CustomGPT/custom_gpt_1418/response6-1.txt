When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about tax implications, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Here’s a structured approach to make your decision:

### 1. Understand Account Types and Their Benefits:
| Account Type | Tax Treatment | Contribution Limits | Withdrawal Rules |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **401(k)**   | Pre-tax or Roth | $20,500 (under 50) or $27,000 (50+) for 2022 | Penalty for withdrawals before 59½; required minimum distributions (RMDs) at 72 |
| **IRA**      | Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) | $6,000 (under 50) or $7,000 (50+) for 2022 | Similar to 401(k); exceptions for first-time home purchase or education |
| **Taxable**  | Taxed on gains and dividends | No limits | No penalties; flexible access |

### 2. Consider Your Goals:
- **Retirement Timeline:** If you're far from retirement, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) could be beneficial.
- **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement.

### 3. Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match; this is "free money."
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:** Aim to max out your IRA contributions next (if you qualify), particularly if you are under 50, as this account grows tax-deferred (or tax-free if Roth).
- **Balance Taxable Accounts:** After maxing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts to maintain flexibility.

### 4. Tax Strategies:
- **Tax Diversification:** Consider having both pre-tax and post-tax accounts (traditional and Roth) to give you flexibility in retirement for withdrawals and tax management.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution of your money will depend on your individual circumstances, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax strategy. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as necessary to align with changing goals and tax laws. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies is highly recommended.
