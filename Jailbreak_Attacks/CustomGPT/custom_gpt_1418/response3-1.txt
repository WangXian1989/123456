Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer match. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Investment growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
  
- **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account, which can be traditional or Roth. Traditional contributions may be tax-deductible; Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

- **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts where capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but less tax efficiency.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Max Out Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of your investment accounts before heavily funding retirement accounts.

- **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to take advantage of potential tax benefits.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Tax Efficiency:** Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes. Stocks that you plan to hold long-term can be placed in taxable accounts due to favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

- **Withdrawal Strategy:** In retirement, plan for a strategy that minimizes taxes while withdrawing funds from your accounts. This may involve carefully choosing which accounts to withdraw from first based on your tax bracket.

### 4. Assess Your Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon
- **Age and Retirement Goals:** Younger investors may choose a higher allocation to stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer more stable investments, balancing between accounts based on risk tolerance.

- **Investment Goals:** Align your investment choices within each account based on specific goals (e.g., home purchase, retirement, etc.).

### 5. Review and Adjust Regularly
- **Regular Check-Ins:** Regularly review your allocations and performance across all accounts as your financial situation and market conditions change.

- **Rebalance:** Ensure your portfolio remains aligned with your risk tolerance and time frame by rebalancing your investments as needed.

### Example Distribution Strategy
| Account Type    | Suggested Contribution Priority     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 401(k)           | Maximize employer match first       |
| IRA              | Contribute if eligible (prefer Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket) |
| Taxable Account   | Contribute surplus funds after maxing out retirement options |

### Conclusion
The best way to distribute your money will ultimately depend on your personal situation. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice that takes all your individual circumstances into account.
