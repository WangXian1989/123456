Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general breakdown to guide your strategy:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** 
     - Tax-deferred contributions, often with employer matching.
     - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
     - Ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
     - Traditional IRA: Tax-deductible contributions; taxes paid upon withdrawal.
     - Roth IRA: After-tax contributions; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals.
     - Subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Goals:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for intermediate-term savings goals, investments that may produce higher capital gains, or if you need more flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth (401(k) and IRA), as they shield your investments from taxes until withdrawal (or forever in Roth IRAs).
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Adjust for Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger investors may favor aggressive growth (higher equity exposure) in tax-advantaged accounts, while older investors may prioritize stability (bonds, cash) as they approach retirement.
   - Diversify investments based on your time horizonâ€”longer investments may withstand more volatility.

### Sample Contribution Strategy:
| Account Type          | Priority Level    | Suggested Contribution % (of total savings) |
|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 401(k)                | High (Initial max) | 15% (to receive employer match first)      |
| Traditional IRA / Roth IRA | Medium   | 10-15% (max out if possible)               |
| Taxable Account        | Lower              | 5-10% (as needed for short-term goals)     |

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
- Monitor your investment performance, contributions, and tax situation annually, adjusting your allocations as necessary to stay aligned with your financial goals.

### Final Thoughts:
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your situation, especially regarding tax implications and retirement planning.

This structured approach will help ensure your investments are optimized for both growth and tax efficiency.
