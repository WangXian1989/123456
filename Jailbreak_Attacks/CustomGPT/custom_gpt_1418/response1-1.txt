Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as it's essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)). Consider your current tax rate versus expected future tax rate when deciding between the two.
- **Investment Options:** Review the fees and investment choices available in your plan.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
- **Type of IRA:** Choose between Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) and Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Again, consider your current versus expected future tax situation.
- **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits and any income restrictions for Roth IRAs.
- **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs generally offer a broader range of investment options compared to many 401(k) plans.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquidity Needs:** These accounts may be suitable for funds you might need before retirement, as they donâ€™t have contribution limits or withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts.
- **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize tax liability.
- **Diversification:** Use taxable accounts for less tax-efficient investments, such as bonds or high-turnover mutual funds.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have adequate savings in an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to 401(k) up to the employer match, then to an IRA, and finally to a taxable account.
- **Adjust Based on Age and Goals:** Younger investors may prioritize growth (more aggressive assets), while closer to retirement, consider shifting toward more conservative, income-generating investments.

### Example Distribution Approach:
| Account Type     | Suggested Action                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 401(k)           | Max out to employer match at least        |
| IRA              | Contribute up to limit based on eligibility |
| Taxable          | Invest excess savings beyond retirement accounts |

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation and financial goals.
