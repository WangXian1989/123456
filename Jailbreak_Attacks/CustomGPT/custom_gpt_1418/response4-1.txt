When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is important to evaluate several factors including tax implications, investment goals, and time horizons. Here’s a general approach to optimizing your investments across these account types:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred until withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals after age 59.5, if certain conditions are met). Consider your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Interest and dividends are also taxable in the year received.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max out employer match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, particularly a Roth IRA if your income allows it, for tax diversification.
   - **Additional 401(k)**: If you have extra funds after contributing to your IRA, continue back to the 401(k) to maximize tax-advantaged contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you may need access to before retirement, or for investment strategies that can benefit from capital gains tax treatment.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend equities) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxable income. 
   - **Tax-efficient investments**: Favor tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to reduce tax liabilities on capital gains.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your investment allocations periodically and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation, accounting for any changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### Example Allocation Approach:
| Account Type  | Focus Area                                         | Typical Allocation        |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 401(k)        | Maximize employer match, tax-deferred growth      | 10-15% of salary          |
| IRA           | Tax-advantaged growth (Roth vs. Traditional)      | $6,000 ($7,000 if over 50)|
| Taxable       | Flexible liquidity, tax-efficient investments      | 5-10% or more as needed   |

### Conclusion:
The best approach involves evaluating your immediate cash flow needs, retirement goals, and tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can further personalize this strategy to suit your unique situation.
