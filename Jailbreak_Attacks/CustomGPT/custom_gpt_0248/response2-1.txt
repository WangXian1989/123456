The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA for potential tax benefits and growth.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit if applicable.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or flexibility, as these accounts allow for quicker access to funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold bonds and other income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding stocks or index funds in taxable accounts due to capital gains treatment.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to adjust based on performance, market changes, and life events.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.

Always consider your long-term goals and risk tolerance when making investment decisions!
