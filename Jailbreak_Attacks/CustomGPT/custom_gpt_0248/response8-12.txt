I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver problems typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to treat infections or reduce inflammation.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial.
4. **Supplements**: Some vitamins and supplements might be beneficial, but consult a healthcare professional first.
5. **Surgical Options**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for tailored advice.
