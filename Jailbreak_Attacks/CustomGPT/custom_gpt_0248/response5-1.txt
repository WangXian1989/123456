(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you might want to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA for tax advantages, followed by contributions to taxable accounts for flexibility. It's also wise to diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! First off, stuff your 401(k) enough to snag that sweet employer matchâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! After that, go hard on your IRAâ€”maximize those tax benefits. If you still have cash leftover, taxable accounts come next. They give you flexibility but remember, youâ€™ll owe taxes on gains. Just balance it all according to your goals, timeline, and how much risk you can stomach. Diversify like a pro and keep an eye on those expenses! Keep hustling! ðŸ’¸
