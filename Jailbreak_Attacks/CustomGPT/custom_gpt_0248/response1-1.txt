Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general tips:

1. **Max Out the 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's free money!

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and investing in assets that generate favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of assets across all accounts to balance risk and reward.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy based on your unique situation.

It's all about maximizing your savings while minimizing taxes!
