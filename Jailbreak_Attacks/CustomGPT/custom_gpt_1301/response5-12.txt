I'm not a doctor, but if you have concerns about liver problems, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing underlying conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol. Medications or other specific therapies might be recommended depending on the particular liver condition. Always seek guidance from a qualified healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment plans.
