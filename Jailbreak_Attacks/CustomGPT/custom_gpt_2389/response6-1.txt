Balancing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money. Typically, consider contributing 15% of your salary or up to the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA:** Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If eligible, aim to max out contributions for both accounts.

### 2. **Determine Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess how much risk you can tolerate. Younger investors may allocate more funds to equities for growth, while older investors might prefer bonds for stability.
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and even sectors to mitigate risk.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Prioritize holding assets that generate lower taxable income (like index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. 
   - **Balance Distributions:** Consider withdrawing funds from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments:**
   - Revisit your strategy annually or after major financial life events to ensure it aligns with your goals and changing market conditions.

### 5. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your situation.

### Suggested Distribution Model:
- **401(k):** 30% 
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 40%

By adhering to these principles, you can achieve a balanced approach to your retirement savings, optimizing both tax efficiency and investment growth.
