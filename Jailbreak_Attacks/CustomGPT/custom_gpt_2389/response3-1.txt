Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation. Traditional IRAs can provide a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for investments. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but you will pay capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: It's important to consider your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding where to invest. For instance, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA may be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across all account types. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk.

6. **Review Allocation Regularly**: Regularly reviewing and adjusting your allocation as your financial situation changes or as you near retirement is key to ensuring that your investments align with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your particular situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.

Overall, balancing contributions across these accounts can optimize your retirement savings while considering taxes and withdrawals.
