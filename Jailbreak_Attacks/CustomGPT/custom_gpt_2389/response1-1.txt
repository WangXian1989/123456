When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to help you get started:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt (like credit card debt), consider paying that down before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

3. **Contribute to Your IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) to the annual limit. The 2023 limit for employee contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional money to invest after maxing out your retirement accounts, a taxable brokerage account can provide flexibility for both short-term and long-term investments. Keep in mind that you'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, consider your overall asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversifying your investments can help manage risk.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications for each account. Traditional accounts can provide tax-deferred growth, while withdrawals from taxable accounts will be taxed in the year they're taken.

8. **Regularly Reassess**: Your situation and the market will change, so regularly reassess your allocations to ensure they're aligned with your goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, so it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice!
