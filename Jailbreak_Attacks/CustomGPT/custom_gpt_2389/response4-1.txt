Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, which may be beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't offer tax advantages like retirement accounts. However, you can take advantage of long-term capital gains rates and tax-loss harvesting strategies.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure that you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses) before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Aim to maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)** (for 2023): $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older).
   - **Traditional and Roth IRA**: $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but consider how much you can afford to invest after covering expenses and retirement savings.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**: Think about your long-term financial goals. If your priority is retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. If you're saving for a shorter-term goal, such as a house, consider allocating more to taxable accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations and rebalance as necessary based on market changes, life changes, and evolving financial goals.

It’s always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs and goals.
