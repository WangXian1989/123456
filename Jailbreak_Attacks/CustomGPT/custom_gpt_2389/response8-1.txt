The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you are eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: After maximizing the match and contributing to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This account offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts provide flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications for each account type, especially for taxable accounts, where you may owe capital gains taxes on profits when you sell securities.

7. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**: As you approach retirement, consider shifting investments towards more conservative options to preserve capital.

It’s also advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
