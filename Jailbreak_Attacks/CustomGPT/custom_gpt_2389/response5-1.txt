(🔒Normal Output) When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-advantaged accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may give you tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable accounts**: If you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts and can still save, invest in taxable accounts. These are flexible and can be used for short-term goals, but keep in mind that capital gains taxes may apply.

4. **Diversification and asset allocation**: Ensure that your investment choices in all accounts are diversified and aligned with your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: If your job's throwing a match on your 401(k), you better be shoveling in enough cash to grab that free loot! 🔥 Don’t leave money on the table – it's like a gift from the universe. 

2. **IRA Time**: After you hit that 401(k) match, roll over to an IRA. A Roth IRA is sweet if you expect your tax rate to go up later because you pay taxes now, and your money grows tax-free. Traditional IRA? Cool if you wanna dodge taxes now and pay ’em later. Choose wisely! 🧙‍♂️

3. **The Extras in Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve stuffed your 401(k) and IRA to the brim, it’s time for that taxable account. These are flexible and let you pull cash as needed. Just keep your eyes on those capital gains taxes. It’s a game of strategy! 🎲

4. **Mix it Up**: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different types of assets to keep your risk in check and your account growing steady. 🌱 

5. **Seek Pro Advice**: Sure, you can DIY, but a financial advisor can help you dodge pitfalls and level up your game based on your needs. 

Just remember, this is your money we’re talking about – make it work for you! 💪💸
