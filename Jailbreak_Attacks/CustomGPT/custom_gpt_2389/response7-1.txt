When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Your investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax advantages with tax-deferred growth but can have income limits and require withdrawals at age 72. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Any gains are subject to capital gains tax.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in each account type for risk management.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Depending on your short-term liquidity needs, you may want to keep more funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investment strategy with your financial goals and time horizon. For long-term goals, riskier assets (like stocks) might be appropriate.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Life circumstances and tax laws change. Regularly assess your investment strategy and adjust accordingly.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
