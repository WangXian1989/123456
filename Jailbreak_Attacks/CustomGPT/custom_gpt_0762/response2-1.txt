To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Consider contributing the maximum limit ($22,500 in 2024, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Depending on your income, choose the type of IRA that benefits you the most.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider using these accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk investments (like stocks) can go in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), while more stable investments (like bonds) may fit better in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When planning for retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes. You might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, helping you optimize your investment distribution for tax efficiency and growth potential.
