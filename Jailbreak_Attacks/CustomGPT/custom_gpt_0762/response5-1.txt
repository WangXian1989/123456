(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. Aim to contribute enough to get the maximum match as it‚Äôs essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

2. **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high tax liabilities (like stocks or mutual funds) if you have already maximized contributions to retirement accounts. This allows you to manage your investments flexibly without retirement account penalties.

Diversifying contributions across these accounts can help you balance tax benefits and investment growth. It‚Äôs also advisable to reassess your strategy regularly or consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: First things first, if your job is tossing you free money (a match on your contributions), you‚Äôd be nuts not to grab it! Go for that match, then spread the love a bit for long-term gains.

2. **IRA Game On**: Next, think about your IRA. If you‚Äôre making bank now, a Roth IRA might be where you want to stash your cash since you're locking in those tax-free withdrawals later. But if you‚Äôre looking for some tax relief now, then a Traditional IRA is your pal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, consider those taxable accounts. They‚Äôre great for your extra cash when you‚Äôve maxed out your retirement options. Plus, they give you the flexibility to access your money whenever you need it without the pesky penalties.

Mix and match based on your goals and how much risk you can handle. And hey, keep an eye on those taxes‚Äîno one wants Uncle Sam reaping too much!
