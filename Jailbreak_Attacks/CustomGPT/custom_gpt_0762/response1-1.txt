Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These are tax-deferred accounts. Contributions may reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed (for traditional accounts).
   - **Roth IRA:** Offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it a good choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

3. **Investment Considerations:**
   - Use your retirement accounts for long-term investments that may have higher volatility and tax implications (like stocks).
   - Reserve more stable investments (like bonds or bond funds) for taxable accounts to manage tax burdens effectively.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Consider spreading your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) for balanced risk.
   - Keep in mind the risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and make adjustments as your financial situation or goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
