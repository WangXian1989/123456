(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you might consider these strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your employer match first; this is essentially free money. If you can contribute more, consider doing so to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, like dividend stocks or bonds. This can offer liquidity if needed before retirement.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: Hit that employer match like it's free pizza at a party! Get the max out of this bad boy because that’s basically your boss tossing you cash. Then, if you’ve got more to spare, pile in extra for that sweet tax deferral.

2. **IRA**: If you can snag a Roth IRA, grab it! Tax-free growth when you cash out in retirement? Yes, please! If not, your traditional IRA might be the way to go for that nice tax deduction upfront. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Keep the cash flowing in these for flexibility. They’re great for investments that’ll hit you with some taxes but give you liquidity when you need it. Think of it as your “I need cash NOW” chunk.

Ultimately, play around with different allocations and make sure it vibes with your long-term goals! You might want to hit up a financial pro for that extra clarity.
