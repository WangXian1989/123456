Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Retirement Accounts First**: Consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA and 401(k) before investing in taxable accounts. 
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax contributions (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Choose based on your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Investment Types**: 
   - Place investments that are likely to generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have a robust emergency fund outside these investment accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Tax Bracket Consideration**: Be mindful of your current tax bracket and future expectations. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts might be more beneficial.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.

Adjust this distribution based on your individual goals and consult a professional for the best approach tailored to your needs.
