When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to take into account several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - Consider contribution limits: In 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500, with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those aged 50 or older.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Decide between Traditional and Roth IRAs based on your tax situation:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Taxes are paid on withdrawals during retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500, with a catch-up of $1,000 for those 50 or older.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After contributing to retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts to invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes, especially if you plan to frequently buy and sell investments. Long-term investments in a taxable account can mitigate tax implications.

4. **General Guidelines**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.
   - **Investment Horizon**: Consider your time horizon for each account type. Retirement accounts typically have a long-term focus, while taxable accounts might be for shorter-term goals.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as needed based on your changing goals and market conditions.

It’s often advisable to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and circumstances.
