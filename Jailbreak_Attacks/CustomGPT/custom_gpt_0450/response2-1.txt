Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - **Type Choice**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals). Depending on your tax situation, one may be more beneficial than the other.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older). 

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - **After maximizing the employer match and IRA contributions**, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if 50 or older).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - If you have additional funds after maximizing retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher growth assets (like stocks) in retirement accounts to benefit from tax deferral and keep lower growth assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Be mindful of your planned retirement withdrawal strategy. Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from different accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, rebalancing as needed.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice that factors in your full financial situation.

This approach should help you build a diversified and tax-efficient investment strategy for your retirement savings.
