The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, be sure to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you are in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction for contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments that don't provide immediate tax benefits (like stocks held long-term).

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term needs (e.g., upcoming expenses) should be funded from taxable accounts to avoid penalties on retirement account withdrawals.
   - Long-term goals benefit from tax-advantaged accounts, where compounding can occur without immediate taxation.

4. **Balance Investments**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Monitor Performance and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on market performance and changes in financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice to refine your strategy based on your unique circumstances.

This general guideline can help you optimize your investments across these accounts, but individual factors will always play a crucial role in your decision-making.
