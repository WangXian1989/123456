When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to factor in your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here's a general strategy to guide you:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments with higher tax burdens (like bonds or real estate investment trusts) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). This strategy helps minimize taxes on taxable accounts, where capital gains and dividend income are taxed.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified mix of assets across all accounts. Maintain your desired asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash) consistently, regardless of the account type.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance.

4. **Long-term Strategy**:
   - Think about your financial goals and timelines. Generally, keep more aggressive investments in accounts with longer time horizons (like your 401(k) and IRA) and less volatile investments in taxable accounts for necessary liquidity.

This strategic allocation will help you optimize your tax situation and grow your savings more effectively. It's also beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
