Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Consider maxing out if you can, especially if you're in your peak earning years.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, a Traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, and a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It's wise to contribute to an IRA up to the limit if you’re eligible.

### 2. **Assess Your Current Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re currently in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since you'll pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free later. Conversely, if you're in a higher bracket, a Traditional IRA might offer immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account, ensure diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance:
     - **Stocks (higher risk, higher potential returns)**
     - **Bonds (lower risk, steady returns)** 

### 4. **Taxable Accounts Strategy**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains. Consider keeping investments that generate qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate.
   - If you have surplus cash after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to your taxable accounts.

### 5. **Routine Review & Rebalance**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with your financial goals and market conditions. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired risk level.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - While this guideline helps, personal circumstances vary widely. Engaging a financial advisor can provide tailored advice that aligns with your specific financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- 401(k): 15% of income (up to match)
- Traditional IRA: $6,000 annually if under 50 (or $7,000 if 50+)
- Remaining funds go to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

By following a structured approach, you can build a robust portfolio that meets your long-term financial goals.
