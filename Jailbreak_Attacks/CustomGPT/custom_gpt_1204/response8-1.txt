Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can greatly influence your retirement savings and tax strategy. Here are some general guidelines that you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It’s essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantage Accounts**: 
   - **Max out your IRA contribution** (if you qualify for deductible contributions) after taking full advantage of your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - For the 2023 tax year, the contribution limits are $19,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Continue to Contribute to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRAs, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its limit if you’re not yet there. This keeps your retirement funds growing tax-deferred.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional funds can be directed to taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in accessing funds, but they also come with taxable events, such as capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals, you should strategically allocate your investments among accounts:
   - **Place high-growth assets** (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without incurring taxes.
   - **Place less volatile or income-producing assets** (like bonds) in taxable accounts to potentially minimize tax impacts.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw money. It can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer, especially if you have a Roth IRA.

7. **Revisit Regularly**: Review your distribution strategy regularly, especially when financial goals change, tax laws fluctuate, or as you age.

As every situation is unique, you might also want to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances. This can ensure you’re optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency.
