To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and tax-deferred growth, but limited investment choices.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages (Roth vs. Traditional) that can be beneficial depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds and a wider range of investment options, but capital gains taxes apply.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth (401(k) and IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains and qualify for lower tax rates.

### 4. **Assess Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:**
   - If you're younger and have a longer time horizon, you can afford to be more aggressive in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For near-term goals, keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Balance Your Investments:**
   - Diversify across asset classes in all accounts, but be mindful of your overall asset allocation to avoid over-concentration in any one type of investment.

### 6. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Income:**
   - In high-income years, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts to reduce your taxable income.
   - During low-income years, consider maximizing IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance Your Portfolio:**
   - Make adjustments based on market conditions and your financial goals to ensure alignment.

### 8. **Seek Professional advice if Needed:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By following these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to distribute your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing growth while considering tax implications.
