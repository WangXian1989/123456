When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Tax is paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with potential income limits for contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax upon sale, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) at least to the level that your employer will match. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Investment Growth Potential:**
   - Allocate a higher percentage to accounts with tax advantages for long-term growth, such as your 401(k) and IRA.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate taxable income or short-term gains.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses in easily accessible accounts.

### 6. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to protect against market volatility.

By implementing these strategies, you can optimize tax efficiency while supporting your long-term financial goals. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice geared toward your specific situation.
