To wisely distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to hit the employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Invest in a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth. If eligible, prioritize your Roth IRA for its tax-free growth potential.
   - Max out contributions to these accounts, subject to the annual limits ($6,500 for IRAs and $22,500 for 401(k)s, as of 2023).

3. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends.
   - Hold growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on high returns.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across various asset classes to spread risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Always keep an emergency fund in a savings account before contributing to long-term investments.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your investments to your personal financial situation with the help of a professional.

By considering these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth while minimizing your tax liabilities over time.
