(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Generally, here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), it's prudent to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA:** If you qualify based on income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment:** Spread your contributions across accounts to take advantage of tax-deferred growth with traditional accounts and tax-free growth with Roth accounts.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:** Younger investors might prioritize contributions to higher-risk assets in a 401(k) and IRA, while those closer to retirement may want more stability in taxable accounts for easier access to funds.

5. **Assess Investment Goals:** Align your investment choices in each account with your overall retirement strategy, financial goals, and risk tolerance.

Consult with a financial advisor for a plan that suits your individual needs.
