The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, pay down any high-interest debt, as the interest on that debt can often outweigh investment returns.

3. **Deductible IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA. This can provide a tax deduction, lowering your taxable income for the year.

4. **Roth IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify (based on income limits). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

5. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, increase your contributions to your 401(k). Focus on increasing to the maximum allowable limit if possible.

6. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you are maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts can provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties for withdrawals (unlike retirement accounts).

7. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Ensure you are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and periodically rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and objectives.

Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer, as the best distribution strategy will reflect your individual financial situation and goals.
