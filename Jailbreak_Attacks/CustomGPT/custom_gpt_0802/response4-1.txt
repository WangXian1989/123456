Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For the 2023 tax year, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans ($30,000 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for accessing funds and managing capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments you expect to appreciate in value over longer terms in these accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes. You can use the accounts to achieve this diversification while considering the tax implications of each.

5. **Evaluate Your Goals**: Your distribution strategy should align with your financial goals—decide whether you're saving for early retirement, funding education, or other objectives and adjust your allocations accordingly.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation, tax laws, and goals may change over time. Review your allocations regularly to ensure they remain aligned with your strategy and make adjustments as needed.

It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
