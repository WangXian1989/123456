When deciding how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then fully fund your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your situation), since these accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use your taxable account for money you may need before retirement age or for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like index funds or tax-efficient funds).

2. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - **Higher Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - **Stable Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Allocate more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since their returns might be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your future withdrawals: Knowing when you plan to access funds can help dictate how much to keep in each account. For example, if you expect to take withdrawals from your taxable account in the near term, consider how this affects your overall investment strategy.

4. **Overall Financial Goals**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
