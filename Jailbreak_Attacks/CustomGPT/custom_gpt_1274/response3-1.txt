The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - Investments in a taxable account can incur capital gains taxes. Favor investments that generate lower dividends or are likely to appreciate long-term, which may minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk and enhance potential returns.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**:
   - Younger investors may prioritize growth in stocks, while those closer to retirement might shift towards more conservative investments.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, life changes, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
