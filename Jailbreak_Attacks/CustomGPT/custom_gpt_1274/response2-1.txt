Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Choose a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; choose a Traditional IRA if you want a tax deduction now.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in potentially lower-tax assets (like index funds) that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.
   - Avoid placing high-turnover or high-income-producing assets in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.
   - Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it maintains your desired asset allocation, taking contributions and market performance into account.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Keep in mind how and when you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and lastly tax-exempt (Roth IRA) accounts.

### Conclusion
The best strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, so consider consulting a financial planner to tailor a plan to your specific needs.
