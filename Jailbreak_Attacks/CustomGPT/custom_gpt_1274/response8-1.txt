Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax, but you can realize losses to offset gains.

### 3. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access in the near future.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Ensure your asset allocation is balanced across all accounts. Consider the impact of taxes on your investment choices, especially in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### 6. **State and Federal Taxes**
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding where to allocate your contributions.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
1. **Max out 401(k) match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
3. **Additional 401(k) or IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, continue with either.
4. **Taxable accounts**: Invest any extra funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Thoughts
Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial goals and market conditions change.
