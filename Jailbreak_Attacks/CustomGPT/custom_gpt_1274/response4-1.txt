To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions if possible, as it lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Roth IRAs can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - Choose investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - In taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains.
   - Any investments that produce dividends or interest should be in tax-advantaged accounts when possible.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse allocation across all accounts. Your overall asset allocation should align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to market changes.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. Consider tapping into taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and lastly tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals is also advisable.
