To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to your employer's match, as it's essentially free money. Typically, contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth options).
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Consider your income level when choosing between them.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth since funds are usually locked until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but offers more investment flexibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or needs; they allow for more liquidity and flexibility.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep higher-growth, more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Consider holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes on interest income.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdraw from your taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts; consider long-term holdings to minimize them.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment mix based on your changing financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific financial situation.
