Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a well-considered strategy that takes into account your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. 

To begin with, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) plan, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution; this is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings. As a next step, turn your attention to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between these two largely depends on your current tax situation and your predictions for the future. A traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions now, whereas a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

Once you've maximized these tax-advantaged accounts, it may be prudent to invest in taxable accounts. These accounts allow for more flexible access to your funds without the restrictions typically associated with retirement accounts. However, it's essential to be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment earnings in these accounts. 

Divvying up your contributions based on your specific financial circumstances and long-term objectives will yield the best results. Regularly reassess your portfolio allocation as your financial situation evolves, ensuring that your investment strategy remains aligned with your goals while optimizing for tax efficiency. Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is one that considers your overall financial picture and future aspirations.
