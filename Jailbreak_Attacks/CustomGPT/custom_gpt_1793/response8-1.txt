The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Both have tax advantages—Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These may be better for investments that might generate high short-term capital gains or interest income, as you’ll want to minimize taxes on those.

3. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Different account types have different tax treatments on withdrawals. Generally, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to manage your tax brackets in retirement.

4. **Investment Growth vs. Accessibility:**
   - Long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks) are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, whereas more liquid and accessible investments can go into taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Ensure a balance of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all your accounts while considering each account's specific tax implications.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:**
   - Periodic reviews of your financial situation, tax law changes, and market conditions will help you adjust your contributions accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation and help optimize your tax strategy.

By strategically allocating your funds according to these principles, you can enhance your financial growth and minimize tax liabilities.
