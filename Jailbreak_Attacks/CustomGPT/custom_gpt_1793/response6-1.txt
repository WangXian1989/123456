Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, ideally up to the maximum allowed. This provides an immediate return on your investment.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts now to minimize future tax liabilities. 
   - In a lower tax bracket? You might favor a Roth IRA or taxable accounts if you anticipate a long time before needing withdrawals.

### 3. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Ensure that some funds are allocated to taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, as they provide more flexible access to your funds without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that might generate high taxes, such as bonds or actively managed funds.
   - Allocate more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts.

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Retirement Timeline:** Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement might focus on preservation and income.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your overall financial objectives.
