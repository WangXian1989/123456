Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, max out your annual contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax strategy.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs), and consider holding assets for the long term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Utilize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to potentially lower your taxable income now, while high earners might benefit from Roth contributions.

4. **Diversify Across Account Types**:
   - Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, considering growth (stocks), income (bonds), and cash needs.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, strategize withdrawals to minimize taxes. Typically, itâ€™s beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
