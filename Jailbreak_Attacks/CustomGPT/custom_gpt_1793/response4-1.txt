To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth and may include employer matching. Contribution limits are higher than IRAs.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs also provide tax benefits but have different rules regarding withdrawals and contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't have contribution limits but are subject to capital gains taxes. They can be useful for short-term savings or emergencies.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) for long-term savings to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all account types based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired balance, keeping in mind the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Keep a portion of your cash in a taxable account for short-term needs or emergencies before maximizing retirement accounts.

7. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs**: Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term savings, while utilizing taxable accounts for shorter-term goals. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation and financial goals.
