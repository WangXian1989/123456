Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides a good foundation for your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs before investing in taxable accounts. This will allow your investments to grow without incurring immediate taxes.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, or a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher bracket. The Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional accounts give you a tax deduction now.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure diversified investments across all accounts. This means mixing stocks, bonds, and other asset classes according to your risk tolerance. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: When you start withdrawing money in retirement, you may want to strategically draw from your taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of which investments you place in which accounts. For example, income-generating investments like bonds might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while stocks, which may appreciate, can be placed in taxable accounts since they benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals and situations.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.
