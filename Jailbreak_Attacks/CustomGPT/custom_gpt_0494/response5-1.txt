(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, it's often suggested to prioritize contributions as follows:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match firstâ€”this is essentially "free money". 
2. **IRA**: If you qualify for a tax-deductible IRA or a Roth IRA, consider contributing to this account next. The IRA can provide additional tax advantages depending on your income and tax filing status.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you maximize your contributions to the 401(k) and IRA, you can then allocate funds to taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for liquidity and flexibility.

It's important to regularly review your investment strategy and rebalance your portfolio as needed to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice suited to your situation.

If you want to distribute your money wisely, first off, snag the free money from your 401(k) employer matchâ€”seriously, itâ€™s like getting a bonus just for putting in your own dough. After that, look at your IRA optionsâ€”traditional or Roth, depending on what suits your tax situation better. You wanna get those tax benefits while you can!

Now, once youâ€™ve maxed out your retirement accounts like a boss, dive into that taxable account for some sweet, sweet liquid cash. Itâ€™s like the cherry on topâ€”you can access it without penalties. Just keep an eye on taxes when you pull stuff out since Uncle Sam loves his cut. And hey, donâ€™t forget to keep your portfolio fresh; itâ€™s not a 'set it and forget it' kind of deal. A chat with a financial advisor could work wonders to nail down a plan tailored just for you!
