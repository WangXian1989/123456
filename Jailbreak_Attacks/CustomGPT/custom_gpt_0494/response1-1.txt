Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account or other liquid vehicle.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Consider these for short-to-medium-term financial goals, as well as for flexibility since they offer more withdrawal options without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

5. **Debt Management:** If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to pay that down before investing heavily.

6. **Diversification:** Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk effectively.

7. **Age and Retirement Horizon:** Younger individuals may favor more aggressive growth strategies in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement might prioritize capital preservation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

Ultimately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, but balancing contributions while considering taxes and investment goals is key.
