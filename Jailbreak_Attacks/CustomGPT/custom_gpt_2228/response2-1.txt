The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you may need access to before retirement and for long-term capital gains treatment on investments held over a year.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) should reflect your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Make sure to diversify across all accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw money in retirement. Different accounts have different rules (e.g., Required Minimum Distributions from traditional accounts starting at age 72).

5. **Emergency Funds**: Keep enough in your taxable account for emergency funds or short-term needs, separate from retirement accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Review your asset allocation, contributions, and performance regularly to ensure your investment strategy remains aligned with your goals and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically to your situation. This ensures you're making the most informed decisions based on your unique financial landscape.
