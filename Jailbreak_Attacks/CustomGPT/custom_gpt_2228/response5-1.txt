(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts first. Here's a simple approach:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth can be especially beneficial for younger investors with potentially lower income in the early stages of their careers.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Once you've maxed out your retirement accounts, consider contributing to taxable investment accounts for more liquidity and investment flexibility.

Remember to regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on your goals and risk tolerance.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer has a match, throw in enough to get that sweet free moneyâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table! Max that out before anything else. It's like an instant ROI.

2. **IRA Magic**: Next, hit up your IRA. If you can swing it, a Roth IRA is a killer choiceâ€”especially if you're still climbing that income ladder and want tax-free withdrawals later. Boom!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Fun**: After youâ€™ve stuffed those retirement accounts, dive into taxable accounts for your extra cash. It'll give you the flexibility to access your money when you need it without the pesky penalties that come with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

Ultimately, itâ€™s about leveraging those tax breaks and keeping as much of your money working for you. Just keep an eye on your investments and adjust as necessaryâ€”donâ€™t let those bucks sit still!
