To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. These accounts provide potential tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in the case of a Roth IRA.

3. **Account Types Matter**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for larger contributions and employer matching, but may have limited investment options and higher fees.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Offers more investment choices and tax advantages. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, which is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement age, as they do not carry penalties for early withdrawal and can be more flexible.

4. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your age, risk tolerance, and when you plan to retire should influence how much you allocate to each account. Younger investors may favor more aggressive growth investments in accounts with long time horizons.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are well diversified to manage risk. Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to mitigate potential losses.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consider seeking professional advice for personalized guidance.

By balancing your contributions among these accounts while considering your financial goals, you'll optimize your savings strategy.
