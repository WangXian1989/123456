Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guide on how to approach this:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a home, or an emergency fund?

2. **Understand Contributions Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no contribution limits, but you are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions to take advantage of tax benefits, either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and retirement strategy.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Distributions from a 401(k) and traditional IRA will be taxed as ordinary income. If you have a Roth IRA, contributions can be withdrawn tax-free, and qualified distributions are also tax-free.
   - In a taxable account, you may face capital gains taxes when selling investments for profit. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, maintain a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and investment performance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure about the best allocation strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor or tax professional.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that maximizes your tax efficiency and helps achieve your financial goals.
