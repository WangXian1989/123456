The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions upfront, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expectations for the future.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**:
   - After maximizing your employer match and contributing to an IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). Look at your overall retirement savings goal and aim to contribute as much as you can, ideally up to the IRS contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you've maxed out your retirement accounts, you can consider taxable investment accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals but come with tax liabilities on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals. Plan your distributions accordingly to minimize tax burdens.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is one that aligns with your financial goals and needs.
