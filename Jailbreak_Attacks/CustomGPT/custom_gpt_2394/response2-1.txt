Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and financial goals. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but are subject to capital gains taxes. Use them for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Create a Balanced Portfolio**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) if your time horizon is long. As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more stable investments (bonds).
   - **IRAs**: Similar strategy as 401(k)s, but you might have a broader range of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding investments that are less tax-efficient (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Assets**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in any of these accounts. Generally, 3-6 months’ worth of expenses is advisable.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailoring your strategy to your specific situation can maximize benefits. An advisor can provide personalized insights.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match + 10% of your salary
- **IRA**: Contribute the annual limit (currently $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining savings focusing on tax-efficient funds

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts can optimize growth while minimizing taxes. Regularly reassess your strategy to keep it aligned with your goals.
