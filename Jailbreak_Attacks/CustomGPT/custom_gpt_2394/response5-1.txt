To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account, aligning them with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use for high-growth assets (like stocks) to delay taxes on gains.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals and Future Tax Implications**
   - Plan withdrawals based on your retirement timeline and expected income. Be mindful of when you'll need access to funds.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your asset allocation as needed based on market performance and life changes.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these principles, you can create an effective investment strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
