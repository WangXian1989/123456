Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after maximizing your IRA contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for additional savings. Use them for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have at least 3-6 months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account to cover unexpected costs.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify within each account. Stocks can be suitable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while you might prefer safer investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

6. **Assess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations based on your goals, market conditions, and any changes in tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your unique situation.
