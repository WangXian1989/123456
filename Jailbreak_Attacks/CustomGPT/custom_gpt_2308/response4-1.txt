Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Pre-Tax Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out your traditional 401(k) contributions, which lower your taxable income.

2. **Utilize IRAs**: 
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you prefer tax deduction now, consider a traditional IRA.

3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Keep in mind the liquidity of these accounts for short-term goals.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize tax liability.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be strategic about when to withdraw from each account type based on your evolving tax bracket.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation.
