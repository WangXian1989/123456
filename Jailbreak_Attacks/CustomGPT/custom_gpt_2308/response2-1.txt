Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize growth and optimize tax efficiency. Here are some strategies:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits, so consider keeping assets with lower turnover and long-term growth.

3. **Diversity in Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to grow significantly (like stocks) since you won’t pay taxes on unrealized gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are relatively stable or generate income (like bonds) since qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your allocations across these accounts to maintain your target asset mix over time.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help you navigate your specific financial situation, ensuring your strategy aligns with your goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively optimize your investment distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
