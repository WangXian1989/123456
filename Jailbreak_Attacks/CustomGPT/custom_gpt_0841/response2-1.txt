Distributing your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some key factors to consider when allocating your funds:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maxed out your contributions, prioritize this account. It offers tax-deferred growth. In 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 plus an additional $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. The 2024 contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Impact**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be funded after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on any profits. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) that generate minimal taxable events.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of accounts, ensure your investments are well-diversified to manage risk. Mix asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think ahead to how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdrawals from taxable accounts may be preferable before tapping into tax-advantaged accounts to extend their growth potential.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws can change. Regularly reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and circumstances.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies and to navigate complexities regarding taxes and investment choices.
