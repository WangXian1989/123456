To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Workplace Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a pre-tax account, so contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions, especially if your employer matches.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you’re eligible, this can also reduce your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible based on income limits, consider this for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It’s beneficial if you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversify Tax Strategies**: Keep a mix of taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts. This will provide flexibility in retirement, allowing for strategic withdrawals based on your tax situation.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility, especially if you might need funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Review Asset Allocation**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, regularly adjust your investment mix across these accounts. Typically, a more aggressive stance is taken in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term nature.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that fits your financial situation and goals.

By considering these strategies, you can create an effective distribution plan that maximizes your current and future financial growth.
