Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Max out any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowable limit if you’re aiming for long-term growth and tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for more liquidity and investment flexibility. This is useful if you anticipate needing funds before retirement or want to engage in different investment strategies.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Tax Implications**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) due to their tax benefits.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your allocations with your risk tolerance, timeline, and investment objectives.
- **Withdrawal Timing**: Plan for when you might need to access funds, as early withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable**: Invest additional savings here based on short- to medium-term goals.
