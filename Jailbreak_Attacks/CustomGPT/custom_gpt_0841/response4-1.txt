Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxable.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are owed when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   
3. **Diversify Account Types**: Blending pre-tax (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) accounts can provide tax diversification in retirement.

4. **Consider Income Needs**: If you anticipate needing money before retirement, taxable accounts may offer more flexibility without early withdrawal penalties compared to 401(k)s and IRAs.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or tax-efficient income, as they can be more strategically managed for tax efficiency.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Make sure your investment choices are aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you might want a more aggressive investment approach in tax-advantaged accounts and a more conservative one in taxable accounts to manage taxes effectively.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust them based on market performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor may also help tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
