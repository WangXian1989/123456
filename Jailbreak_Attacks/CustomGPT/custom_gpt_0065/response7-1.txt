Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money!

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before investing heavily.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to contribute the maximum to your IRA and 401(k) if possible. This reduces taxable income and can grow tax-deferred.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest surplus funds in taxable accounts. This allows for easier access to funds without penalty.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across accounts to maintain a balanced portfolio. You may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts and allocate safer assets in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Long-Term Focus**: Ensure your strategy aligns with your retirement goals, considering factors like risk tolerance and investment time frame.
