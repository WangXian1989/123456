To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - If available, focus on tax-deferred options for higher income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Contribute to a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Aim to maximize the annual contribution limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds).
   - Consider the tax implications of selling investments; long-term capital gains are taxed lower than short-term.

4. **Overall Balance**:
   - Strive for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk and growth based on your timeline.
   - Adjust contributions based on your tax situation, expected retirement timeframe, and investment goals.

5. **Continual Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations regularly, especially as markets change or your financial situation evolves.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
