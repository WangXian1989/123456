To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this if your employer offers a match. Contribute to the maximum allowable amount if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need for short-term goals or when you want more access to your funds.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use these for higher-growth investments, as you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Choose tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to align with your financial goals and changing circumstances.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy across your accounts.
