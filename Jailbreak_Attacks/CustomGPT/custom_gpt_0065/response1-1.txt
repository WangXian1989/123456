Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get employer matching (if available). Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Use either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Max out contributions as permitted.

2. **Assess your tax situation**:
   - **Traditional accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA) offer tax-deferred growth but are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth accounts** (Roth IRA) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for investments that generate tax-efficient income (like qualified dividends).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Invest in a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.

5. **Regularly review and adjust**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your specific situation.
