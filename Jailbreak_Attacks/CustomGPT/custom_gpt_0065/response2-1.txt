Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs are best if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing up to the annual limit after maximizing the match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond retirement accounts. They offer flexibility with withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep higher-growth, riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) that provide regular income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
