Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider maximizing your IRA (especially if it's a Roth IRA, which has tax-free growth) before contributing more to your 401(k).

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as 401(k), but with potential deduction limits based on income and other factors.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free, making it advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for flexible access and investing beyond retirement accounts, though youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Depending on your investment strategy, certain types of assets may perform better in tax-advantaged accounts. For example, holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts can help reduce tax burdens since they generate interest income, which is taxed at higher rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio across the different accounts as market conditions and your personal goals change.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and individual circumstances, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investment growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
