I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health. Reducing alcohol intake and avoiding processed foods are also essential.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed. For example, antiviral drugs may be used for viral hepatitis, while corticosteroids might be utilized for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Weight Management**: If obesity or fatty liver disease is a concern, weight loss through a balanced diet and regular exercise can improve liver function.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and screen for complications are crucial.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions such as liver transplantation might be necessary.

6. **Supplements**: Some individuals find benefit from supplements like milk thistle or antioxidants, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplements.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
