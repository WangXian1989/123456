When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Check if you can make traditional or Roth contributions based on your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Determine Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (with a catch-up of $7,500 if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with a catch-up of $1,000).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Decide how to allocate your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, reserve more aggressive investments (such as stocks) for taxable accounts where capital gains tax may apply.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, consider the order in which you'll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties. Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) may be taxed upon withdrawal, so plan accordingly.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxable income.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances, including financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans.

By following these strategies, you can effectively allocate your investments to maximize growth and minimize taxes over time.
