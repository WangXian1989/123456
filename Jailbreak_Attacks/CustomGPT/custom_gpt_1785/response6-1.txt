Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions next. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility and access to funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on any investments.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) to tax-advantaged accounts where the growth can be tax-deferred. Consider more stable investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax burdens. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

These strategies can help create a balanced distribution that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing for tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
