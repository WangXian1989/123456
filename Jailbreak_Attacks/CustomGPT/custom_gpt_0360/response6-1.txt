When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA to further benefit from tax deferment or tax-free growth.

2. **Balance liquidity and accessibility**:
   - **Taxable accounts**: Maintain a portion of your investments in taxable accounts for liquidity. Investments in these accounts can be accessed without penalties at any time, unlike retirement accounts.

3. **Monitor investment growth and tax implications**:
   - Evaluate the performance of your investments across all accounts regularly.
   - Consider capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts and how they may affect your overall tax situation.

Assess your current financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance to create a tailored strategy for distributing your funds effectively.
