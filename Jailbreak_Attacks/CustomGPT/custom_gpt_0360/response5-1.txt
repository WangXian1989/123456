(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your individual financial situation, including your income level, tax bracket, retirement goals, and time horizon. Generally, many financial advisors suggest the following approach:

1. Max out any employer-matched contributions in your 401(k) to take full advantage of free money.
2. Contribute to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax considerations) since these accounts offer tax advantages.
3. After maximizing your retirement account contributions, you can then allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional investment flexibility and accessibility.

Consulting a financial planner can also provide you with personalized advice tailored to your situation.
