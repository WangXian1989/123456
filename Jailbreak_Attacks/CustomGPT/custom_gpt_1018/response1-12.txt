I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for specific medical advice. Common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage underlying conditions, and in more severe cases, procedures or surgery. A doctor can provide the best guidance based on your specific condition and needs.
