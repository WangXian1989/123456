The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially "free money".
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and IRA reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Contributions to a Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for flexibility, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term investments, focusing on growth-oriented assets, as they have tax advantages.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you plan to access funds in the short term, keep that money in a taxable account to avoid penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts.
   - For long-term growth, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Regularly review your investment portfolio to ensure your allocations align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
