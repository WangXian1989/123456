When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to assess your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages; can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts with no tax advantages; capital gains are taxed.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If you have access to a 401(k) with employer matching, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts, as they provide tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment strategy. This means holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRA contributions (with catch-up options for those over 50).

6. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider a balanced approach based on your age and retirement timeline. Younger individuals may prefer more aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement might look for more conservative options.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Periodically review your account distributions and investment performance. Make adjustments as necessary based on changing life circumstances or market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consult with a financial advisor to help tailor a plan that fits your specific financial situation and long-term goals.

Following these steps will help ensure you're effectively distributing your money to optimize growth and manage tax liabilities effectively over time.
