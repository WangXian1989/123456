When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investments:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money. After that, consider maximizing your contribution limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. The contribution limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA (which uses after-tax dollars) might be more beneficial.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, the longer your money is invested, the more risk you can afford to take.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Specific Investments**:
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. You may also want to hold cash or short-term bonds here for liquidity.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your investment strategy and financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds during retirement. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize your tax bill.

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, as individual circumstances can significantly impact the best approach for distributing your money.
