The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for an effective strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions up to the limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you prefer to pay taxes now (Roth) or later (traditional).

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if youâ€™re over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account for additional investments. This can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals since you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: 
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts. This means incorporating a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Regular Review and Reallocation**: 
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If unsure about the best strategy, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

Creating a well-thought-out distribution strategy will help optimize your savings and investment growth for the future.
