When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate a few key factors. Here's a general approach to help you decide:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed on capital gains, dividends, and interest. Consider holding investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize the tax impact.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: Assess your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Those with longer timelines may opt for more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might prefer more conservative strategies.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Be mindful of how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Having a mix can offer flexibilityâ€”using tax-advantaged funds first and delaying taxable funds can help manage your tax bracket.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

In summary, consider maximizing your 401(k) match first, balance contributions between 401(k) and IRA according to their respective tax advantages, and utilize taxable accounts for additional savings or short-term goals. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
