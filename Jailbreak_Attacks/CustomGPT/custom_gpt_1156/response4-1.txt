Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve maxed your IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions. These accounts have higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional savings in taxable accounts. This allows more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider placing higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) since gains are taxed at withdrawal. Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and short-term gains.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: As your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement, regularly reassess your distribution strategy to ensure it aligns with your goals.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
