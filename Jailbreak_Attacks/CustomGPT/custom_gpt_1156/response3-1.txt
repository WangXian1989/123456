Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income eligibility and tax strategy. 
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.

### 3. **Pay Attention to Contribution Limits**
   - For 2024, the maximum contribution limit is:
     - **401(k):** $23,000 (under age 50), $30,500 (age 50 and older).
     - **IRA:** $6,500 (under age 50), $7,500 (age 50 and older).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, consider funding a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, though investments may be subject to capital gains tax.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, considering the tax implications of each:
     - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Consider holding higher-growth assets like stocks which may generate more taxable income (interest/dividends).
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or stocks, which can minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Reassess and Adjust Annually**
   - Review your allocations and contributions regularly, adjusting for changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider seeking personalized advice from a certified financial planner to tailor your strategy based on your unique circumstances.

This approach will help you take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring flexibility for future financial needs.
