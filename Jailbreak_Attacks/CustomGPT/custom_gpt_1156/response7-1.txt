Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a balance of tax efficiency, investment goals, and your financial situation. Here’s a breakdown of strategies you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k), contribute to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Treatment:** Prefer tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) for investments expected to grow significantly, as they delay taxes until you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Roth IRAs:** If you anticipate higher taxes in retirement, contributing to a Roth might be beneficial since those withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxes or have a long-term horizon. For instance, index funds can be tax-efficient due to lower turnover.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts, as those gains can be taxed.
   - **Diversification:** Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts. Ensure that you are not overly concentrated in one type of investment.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**
   - Plan to withdraw from accounts in a tax-efficient order, likely starting with taxable accounts, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out contributions, especially if there’s an employer match.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Contribute the max based on eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any additional savings here, focusing on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### Conclusion
Your specific situation may call for adjustments based on your income level, investment timeline, and tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs.
