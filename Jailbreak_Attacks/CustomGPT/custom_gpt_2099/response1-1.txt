Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out contributions here next, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement (Traditional) or prefer tax-free withdrawals (Roth).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you may need sooner or for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**
   - Short-Term Goals: For any savings you might need in the next 5-10 years, prioritize taxable accounts.
   - Long-Term Goals: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your investments and rebalance if necessary, taking into account your changing life circumstances.

### Final Tip
Consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique situation, as they can help you navigate the complexities of taxes and investment options.
