Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in more tax-efficient options (like index funds or ETFs) since these are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize interest income taxes.

### 3. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as needed to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 4. **Consider Retirement Timeline and Withdrawals**
   - If you're closer to retirement, shift towards lower-risk investments, especially in taxable accounts, to ensure stability.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Strategize how you'll withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s, and lastly from tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

By assessing your individual situation and considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments across these accounts. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
