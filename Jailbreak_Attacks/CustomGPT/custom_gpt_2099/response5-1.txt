Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get your employer's match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax bracket. 

### 2. **Consider Taxation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that incur lower taxes or for short-term goals. Theyâ€™re ideal for flexibility but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Hold more actively managed funds or higher growth investments here to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that distribute less taxable income.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily in any of these accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your allocations to align with changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (up to the employer match)
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum amount (e.g., $6,500 for 2023)
- **Taxable account**: Contribute any remaining funds based on short- and mid-term goals.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances.
