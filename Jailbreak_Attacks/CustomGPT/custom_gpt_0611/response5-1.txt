(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if you can, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you suspect you'll be in a lower tax bracket, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or when you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

Evaluating your overall asset allocation and any specific financial goals or retirement timelines is crucial. Consulting a financial advisor might also provide personalized insights based on your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! First off, you've got three awesome investment vehicles: a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts. Your strategy should play to the strengths of each:

1. **401(k)**: This is your bread and butter. If your employer matches contributions, for crying out loud, donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Aim to contribute enough to max out that match, then throw in more if you can. Itâ€™s pre-tax, so youâ€™re dodging a good chunk of taxes now!

2. **IRA (Roth vs. Traditional)**: If you expect to be making bank down the line, a Roth IRA is killer because you pay taxes now, and that money grows tax-free! If you think youâ€™ll earn less in retirement, get a Traditional IRA for the write-off. Max these out as well, folks!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are for when youâ€™ve already hit the ceiling on those tax-advantaged accounts. You can get creative here with tax-efficient investments. Always think about your short-term goals or diversifying your investment strategy.

Basically, donâ€™t just toss money randomly. Think about your future, your tax situation, and get that sweet, sweet compound growth going! You might want to chat with a financial advisor for some tailored advice, but that's the gist!
