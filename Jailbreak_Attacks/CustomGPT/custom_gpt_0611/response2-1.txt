Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before allocating funds to investment accounts, consider paying off high-interest debt, which generally provides a higher return on investment than investment accounts.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing more to your 401(k), especially if you’re in a high tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

4. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. The choice between the two depends on whether you expect your tax rate to be lower or higher in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short-term goals.

6. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your portfolio to rebalance and adjust your strategy as your financial situation or market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
