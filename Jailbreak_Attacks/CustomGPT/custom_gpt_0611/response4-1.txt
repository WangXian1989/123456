Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth). IRAs often have lower fees and more investment choices.

3. **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s ($30,000 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and goals. Consider holding more aggressive investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free.

5. **Tax Considerations:** In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

6. **Retirement Withdrawals:** Plan your withdrawals for retirement carefully. Withdraw from tax-deferred accounts first to manage your tax bracket effectively, then from tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs, and lastly from taxable accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocation based on changes in your income, life circumstances, and market conditions. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
