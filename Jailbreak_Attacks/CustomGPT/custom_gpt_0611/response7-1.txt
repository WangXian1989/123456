Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing enough to get the full match first. Then, if your goal is retirement savings, prioritize your 401(k) contributions, especially if it offers low-cost investment options.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, you can contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be a great option for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially beneficial for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This flexibility can be useful for short- to mid-term financial goals (e.g., home purchase, education).

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment choices within these accounts align with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider how to diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on life changes, market conditions, or shifts in your financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
