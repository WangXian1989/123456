When considering how to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate a few key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs function similarly to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (after age 59Â½ and meeting the five-year rule).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains, so it's a good idea to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you maximize employer contributions to your 401(k), especially if they match a portion of your contributions.
   - Know the annual contribution limits for IRAs and 401(k)s to take full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Horizon and Goals**:
   - If you have a long time horizon, aggressive growth investments can be considered in tax-deferred accounts.
   - More liquid and conservative investments may be better suited for taxable accounts, especially if you anticipate needing the funds sooner.

4. **Retirement Strategy**:
   - Aim to have a balanced approach to manage risk while aiming for growth. Diversify the allocation based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement for tax efficiency.

A common strategy could be:
- Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first.
- Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- Invest any additional savings in a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and goals. Would you like more detailed advice on any specific account type?
