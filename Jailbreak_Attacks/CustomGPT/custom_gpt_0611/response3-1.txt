The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA after maxing out your 401(k) contributions. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Impact**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing any additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that may generate higher taxable income, such as bonds or REITs. Reserve taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as ETFs or index funds.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more towards growth-oriented investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors might want to shift towards more conservative investments as they approach retirement.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Consider Fees and Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment options and fees in your 401(k) plan, as they can impact your long-term returns. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited investment choices, you might prioritize funding your IRA or taxable accounts.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing. This provides financial security and flexibility.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these guidelines to your specific circumstances and objectives.
