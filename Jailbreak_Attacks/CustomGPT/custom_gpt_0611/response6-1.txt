Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible for a Traditional IRA, it can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Strategic Taxable Investments**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Diversification:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher taxes, such as real estate or high-turnover stocks, if you're comfortable managing the tax implications.

### Ongoing Considerations
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
- **Consider Your Time Horizon:** Longer time horizons might lean more heavily on equities in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter horizons may need more conservative allocations.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual circumstances.
