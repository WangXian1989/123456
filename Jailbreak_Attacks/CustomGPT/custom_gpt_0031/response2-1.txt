Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Roth IRAs grow tax-free; Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now but tax you later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxable in the year they occur.

### 3. **Emergency Savings**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid, accessible account before maximizing contributions.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - For short-term goals (less than 5 years), lean towards taxable accounts.
   - For long-term goals, prioritize 401(k) and IRA for their tax advantages.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Allocate investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account type based on your risk tolerance and horizon.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your contributions based on performance and changing needs.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income up to the match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (currently $6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds.

### Consult with a Financial Advisor
- Customize your approach based on your unique financial situation.

This balanced strategy considers both tax efficiency and investment growth.
