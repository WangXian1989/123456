To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer match and tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions, especially to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed, but they offer flexibility for access without penalties.

2. **Contribution Strategy**:
   - Start contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, focusing on a Roth if you’re eligible (based on income limits).
   - Any additional savings can go into your taxable account, particularly for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Investment Selection**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Assess your current and projected future tax brackets to decide between traditional and Roth contributions.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and account for market changes.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Focus on long-term growth in retirement accounts, while keeping enough liquidity in taxable accounts for near-term needs.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
