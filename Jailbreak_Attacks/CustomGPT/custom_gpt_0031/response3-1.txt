To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to this account, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, utilize taxable accounts for additional investments. These provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - Stock-focused investments in tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
   - Bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to mitigate tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, seeking professional guidance can help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

This strategy balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential while considering liquidity needs.
