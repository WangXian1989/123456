Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds for diversification.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. Use Traditional IRAs for tax deductions now if you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you are maximizing contributions within the limits set for the year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient funds (like index funds) or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- **First**: Contribute to your 401(k) enough to get any employer match.
- **Second**: Max out your IRA contributions.
- **Third**: Use any remaining funds for your taxable accounts, focusing on long-term growth with a tax-efficient strategy.

**Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation. 

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
