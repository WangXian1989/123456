Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax bracket. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed if your employer matches or if you want to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in a taxable account. This is beneficial for flexibility and liquidity. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Keep in mind that tax implications can vary across account types.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Diversifying the types of accounts can provide more flexibility in managing your taxable income.

By following these strategies and tailoring them to your personal situation, you can optimize the distribution of your funds effectively.
