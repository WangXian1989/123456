Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is free money! 

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out contributions if possible. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA offers tax benefits now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for short-term goals or to invest in assets that may generate capital gains. It’s also great for flexibility since you can access funds without penalties.

### Prioritization Steps:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavy investing.
- **Debt**: Pay off high-interest debt first.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep stocks or ETFs in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### Strategy:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your age and how comfortable you are with risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your distribution based on performance and changes in goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your specific situation.
