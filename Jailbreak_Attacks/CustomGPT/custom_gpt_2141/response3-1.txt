Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can be useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: These allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the type of account, ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio suited to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
