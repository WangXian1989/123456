Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes on earnings.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Place income-generating investments, like bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes. Conversely, hold investments with lower expected tax burdens, like index funds or long-term capital gain stocks, in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### Example Allocation Strategy
| Account Type       | Suggested Allocation       |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 401(k)            | Up to employer match + 15-20% of salary |
| IRA (Traditional/Roth) | 10-15% of salary        |
| Taxable Accounts   | Remaining funds           |

### Important Considerations
- **Retirement Timeline:** Adjust your allocation based on how close you are to retirement. Younger investors might opt for a higher risk/return profile.
- **Financial Goals:** Tailor your distribution to align with short-term vs. long-term objectives.

### Conclusion
An optimal allocation balances immediate tax benefits and long-term growth. Regular reviews and adjustments based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals are also essential for effective money management.
