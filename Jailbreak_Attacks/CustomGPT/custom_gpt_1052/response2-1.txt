When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing the maximum allowed. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. While these accounts do not offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, they provide greater flexibility and access to your money without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - For the taxable account, favor investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize your capital gains tax burden.
   - If you have a Roth IRA, you can withdraw contributions anytime without penalty, providing an additional layer of liquidity.

5. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments. Maintaining proper asset allocation is crucial for achieving your long-term financial goals.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation in each account. Life changes, market conditions, and shifts in your financial goals may necessitate adjustments to your contribution strategy.

In summary, a common strategy involves first taking advantage of any employer match in your 401(k), maxing out your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), and then allocating any additional savings to taxable accounts, all while considering your overall tax situation and investment diversification.
