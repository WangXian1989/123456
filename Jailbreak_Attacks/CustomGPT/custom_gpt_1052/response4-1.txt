To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Taxes will be owed upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, deferring taxes until withdrawal. Roth IRAs involve post-tax contributions, providing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Interest and dividends earned are also taxable in the year received.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) up to the annual limits. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA ($7,500 if youâ€™re age 50 or older).
   
3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize pre-tax contributions (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - If you anticipate a higher tax bracket, favor Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Align your investment choices with your financial goals. For short-term goals, consider highly liquid assets in taxable accounts. For long-term growth, equities might be suitable in tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher potential for appreciation.

5. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Ensure you have sufficient emergency savings outside of retirement accounts before investing heavily.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and achieve a balanced growth strategy.
