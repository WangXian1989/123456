When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as tax implications, your individual financial goals, and your investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that allows you to save for retirement while enjoying tax benefits. Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, which can help reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** This can be a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you have access to a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are non-retirement investment accounts where you pay taxes on capital gains and dividends in the year they're realized. They offer more flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a company match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, consider funneling money into your IRA. If you can, max out contributions to both accounts as they provide tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these accounts for extra savings or investments once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They can be particularly useful for short-term goals or liquidity needs.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might favor Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) now.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA) may be more advantageous since you can defer taxes.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, allocate investments across these accounts. Generally, it might be beneficial to hold riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications better.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:**
   - As your financial situation, goals, and tax laws change, itâ€™s vital to review and adjust your strategy periodically.

### Sample Distribution Suggestion:
| Account Type   | Suggested Action                |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| 401(k)         | Contribute enough for full match, then max if possible. |
| IRA            | Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year.        |
| Taxable Account | Invest remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. |

Lastly, it could be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
