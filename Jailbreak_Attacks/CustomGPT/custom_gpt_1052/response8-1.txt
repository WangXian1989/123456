To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA after taking advantage of your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Focus on Tax-Deferred Accounts**: After the Roth IRA, direct your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps reduce your taxable income now, and taxes are deferred until you withdraw funds in retirement.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts. Therefore, if you anticipate needing funds before retirement, allocate some money to a taxable account.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep investments that generate higher taxes (like actively managed funds) in tax-deferred accounts and hold more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts. This strategy minimizes taxes on dividends and capital gains.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation and contributions based on changes in financial goals, market performance, and tax laws. Adjust your strategy as needed.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personal advice from a financial advisor to tailor a specific plan that aligns with your financial goals and situation.

By strategically distributing your contributions across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation while growing your retirement savings effectively.
