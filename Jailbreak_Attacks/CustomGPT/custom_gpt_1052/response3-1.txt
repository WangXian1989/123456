Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Contribution limits apply. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Allow for more flexibility in investment choices with fewer restrictions on withdrawals. However, capital gains taxes are incurred on profits.

2. **Assess Your Retirement Goals:**
   - Define your retirement age, expected expenses, and lifestyle.
   - Determine how much money you aim to accumulate by that time.

3. **Estimate Tax Implications:**
   - Consider your current and projected future tax rates. Contributing to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) can lower your current taxable income. Conversely, contributing to Roth accounts may be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Diversify Contributions:**
   - **Max out employer match in your 401(k):** Ensure you at least contribute enough to get the maximum match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account for additional investments and liquidity.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Monitor your portfolio and reassess allocations based on investment performance, changes in financial goals, lifestyle changes, or tax legislation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider getting personalized advice tailored to your individual situation. A financial advisor can help you create a comprehensive strategy that balances growth potential and tax efficiency.

In summary, aim to maximize your employer-sponsored 401(k), leverage tax-advantaged IRA contributions, and use taxable accounts for flexibility and additional growth.
