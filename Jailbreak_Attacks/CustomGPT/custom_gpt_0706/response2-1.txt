The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit if you have a high-income potential or if your employer offers a strong suite of investment options.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income level and eligibility, contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA can be beneficial. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if you qualify, while a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can give you flexibility for shorter-term goals or emergency funds, and certain investments may be taxed at a lower rate (e.g., long-term capital gains).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, keeping in mind that tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) are better placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be held in taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind your current and projected future tax rates. Strategic withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts in retirement can help manage your tax liabilities effectively.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure you regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that considers your unique financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages and supports your long-term financial goals.
