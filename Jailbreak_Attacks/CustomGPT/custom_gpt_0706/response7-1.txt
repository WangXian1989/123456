The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Roth or traditional) to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs can be particularly advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and maximize your contributions up to the annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may have high turnover or generate interest income, as these can be taxed at higher rates than long-term capital gains. 

5. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an adequate emergency fund set aside in a more liquid account, separate from these investment accounts.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments in terms of asset classes that match your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Review and adjust your contributions and allocation periodically based on market conditions and changes in your personal circumstances.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that fits your specific situation.

**Note**: These are general guidelines and may vary based on individual circumstances. Always consider your personal financial situation and goals when making investment decisions.
