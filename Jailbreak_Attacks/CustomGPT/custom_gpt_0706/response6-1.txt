To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approaches:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money". Prioritize maximizing your contributions to a Roth 401(k) if your employer offers it, as it provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you expect your tax rate to decrease in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial due to tax deferral.

2. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers a limited selection of mutual funds. Ensure you choose low-cost index funds to minimize fees and maximize long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments, such as stocks or ETFs, where you can manage capital gains and losses strategically. Also consider municipal bonds for tax-free income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Distribute your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to spread risk.
   - Factor in your risk tolerance and time horizon to adjust asset allocation accordingly.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

To summarize, focus on maximizing tax-advantaged contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, diversify within your accounts, and carefully consider your withdrawal strategy to optimize your financial outcomes. Consulting with a financial advisor might also enhance your strategic allocation based on your unique financial situation.
