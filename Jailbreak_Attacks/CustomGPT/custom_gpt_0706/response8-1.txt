Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors such as your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After maximizing your employer match, focus on contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you can, as these accounts often offer better tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Treatments:**
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and IRA are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Roth accounts use after-tax dollars but allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to Roth accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. This offers flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts. For example, you might choose more aggressive investments in taxable accounts where capital gains taxes may apply.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk.

7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your assets' allocation and performance, adjusting as necessary based on changes in your life circumstances or market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure compliance with tax regulations.
