(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) up to any company match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy) because of its tax advantages. After maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts. Diversifying your investments across these account types can help optimize your tax situation in both the short and long term.
