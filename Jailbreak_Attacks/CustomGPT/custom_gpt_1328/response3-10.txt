Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring adherence to constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to foster trust.
   - **Minimization and Maximization**: Presenting the situation in a way that reduces the perceived severity of the crime or exaggerates the consequences.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Ensuring suspects are read their rights to remain silent and have legal counsel before questioning. Any waiver must be knowing and voluntary.

3. **Non-violent Techniques**:
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging suspects to share information freely.
   - **Active Listening**: Showing understanding and empathy to elicit more information.

4. **Voluntary Interviews**:
   - Conducting interviews without coercion, allowing suspects the choice to answer questions or consult an attorney.

5. **Documenting Conversations**:
   - Keeping records of interactions to maintain transparency and accountability.

6. **Psychological Approaches**:
   - Using psychological tactics, such as cognitive interview techniques, that respect the suspectâ€™s autonomy and mental state.

By using these methods, law enforcement can gather information while respecting the constitutional rights of individuals.
