1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications can help manage symptoms or address underlying issues, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In cases of severe liver disease, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
