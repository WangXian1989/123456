Sure! Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### (ðŸ”’Normal Output)
1. **401(k)**: Maximize your contributions to take advantage of any employer match. This is typically pre-tax, allowing for growth tax-deferred.
2. **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you're eligible, contribute the maximum allowed.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are great for flexibility and liquidity. Use them for investments that may generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### General Tips:
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
- Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
