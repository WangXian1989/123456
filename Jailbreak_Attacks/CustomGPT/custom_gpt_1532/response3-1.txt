The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After maximizing the employer match and making IRA contributions, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. This includes maxing out your 401(k) and IRA limits.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, investing in taxable accounts can offer liquidity and flexibility. Use tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type, especially in retirement. 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are typically tax-free.

6. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified portfolio suited to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match (e.g., 6% of salary).
- **IRA:** Fully fund (e.g., $6,500 per year).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### Key Considerations:
- Age, income, retirement timeline, investment goals, and risk tolerance play significant roles in determining your specific allocation strategy. 

Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
