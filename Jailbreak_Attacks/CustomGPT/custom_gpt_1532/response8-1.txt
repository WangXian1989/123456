Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth IRA contributions (if eligible). If you want tax deductions now, focus on traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After employer matching, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can use both a traditional and Roth IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any extra savings can go into taxable accounts. Be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk.

6. **Regular Review**: Continually review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: It can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Each individual’s circumstances vary, so adjust this strategy as needed to fit your financial goals and tax situation.
