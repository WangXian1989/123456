To distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand the Account Types
- **401(k):** Often comes with employer matching; contributions are pre-tax.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Tax advantages vary; Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Flexibility with withdrawals but subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After the match, prioritize contributions to an IRA, particularly if you can utilize a Roth account for tax-free growth.
- **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:** Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. Regular Review and Rebalance
- **Adjust Contributions:** Annually review your contributions and adjust based on changes in income or retirement goals.
- **Diversify Investments:** Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

By balancing contributions according to these principles, you can optimize your retirement savings while considering tax implications and investment growth potential.
