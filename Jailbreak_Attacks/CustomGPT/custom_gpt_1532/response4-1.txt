Deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You will pay capital gains tax on any profits when you sell investments, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your portfolio across all accounts is diversified to balance risk and growth potential.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in place (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

5. **Retirement Goals**: For long-term growth, lean towards investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) instead of taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your situation.
