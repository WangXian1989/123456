Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. If you can afford to contribute more, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount ($20,500 for individuals under 50, and $27,000 for those 50 and older in 2023).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. The maximum contribution for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and Traditional IRA are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) require after-tax contributions but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility but are taxed on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
