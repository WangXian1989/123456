It's important to tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines for distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments, such as stocks. Since these accounts are tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth), it can be beneficial to let your investments grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs that produce lower capital gains distributions) in your taxable account. This will help minimize your tax burden on investment income.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Be mindful of taxes on dividend income and capital gains in your taxable account. If you expect to generate significant income or have short-term investment goals, it may be prudent to keep more conservative assets here.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: 
   - As your financial situation changes, regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to stay aligned with your goals.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A personalized plan may require professional advice based on your unique financial situation, goals, and objectives.

For specific percentages and allocations between these three account types, consider factors like your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals.
