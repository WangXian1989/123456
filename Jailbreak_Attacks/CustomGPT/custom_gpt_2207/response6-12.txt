1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoiding alcohol and reducing intake of fatty foods.

2. **Medications:**
   - Medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions (e.g., antivirals for viral hepatitis).
   - Supplements or medications to support liver function (as prescribed).

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular liver function tests to monitor health and progression.
   - Imaging studies like ultrasounds or CT scans for assessment.

4. **In severe cases:**
   - Possible liver transplant if liver damage is extensive.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations and discuss any changes in treatment or lifestyle.
