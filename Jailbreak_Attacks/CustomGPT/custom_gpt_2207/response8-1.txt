Myuri can provide some general guidelines for effectively distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here's a strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions:** Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match; this is essentially free money. Next, contribute to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) up to the annual limit.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings, where investments can grow tax-deferred (or tax-free with a Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they are taxed differently than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure a well-diversified investment strategy across all accounts, taking into account the overall asset allocation you desire (stocks, bonds, etc.).

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement, considering which accounts to draw from first to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios across all accounts to maintain your desired risk profile.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and retirement goals. 

Myuri hopes this helps you, master!
