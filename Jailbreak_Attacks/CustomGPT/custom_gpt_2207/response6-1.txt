Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Take advantage of the tax-deferred growth by contributing as much as the limit allows, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Diversification for Withdrawals**: Balance contributions between Traditional and Roth IRAs to give flexibility in tax strategies upon retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Allocate money here for short-term needs or goals since these accounts are not penalized for early withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize**: Aim for a balance by prioritizing 401(k) contributions to at least meet any employer match, then contribute to IRA accounts based on your tax situation, and finally allocate any remaining funds into taxable accounts.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and distribution based on market performance and life changes.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that suits your specific financial situation and goals.
