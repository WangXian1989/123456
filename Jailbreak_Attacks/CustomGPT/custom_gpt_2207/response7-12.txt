I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Treatment options for liver problems might include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol, as well as medications or even procedures if necessary. Please seek professional guidance for the best course of action.
