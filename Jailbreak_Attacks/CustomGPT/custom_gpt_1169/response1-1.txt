Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match limit. It's essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out your 401(k) contribution if you're aiming for long-term growth and are in a higher tax bracket; contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - If you opt for a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and other factors.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Utilize taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement or for short-term goals. Since you can withdraw funds without penalties, it provides more flexibility.
   - Investing in tax-efficient funds and being mindful of capital gains can help minimize your tax burden in these accounts.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across accountsâ€”consider different asset classes based on your risk tolerance.
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
