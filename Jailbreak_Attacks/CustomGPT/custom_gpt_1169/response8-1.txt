Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and current investment options. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if you have a high income and tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide whether a traditional or Roth IRA suits your needs. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs, and consider maximizing these contributions if eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts can provide more flexibility since they are not subjected to the same withdrawal rules as retirement accounts. Consider placing investments here that you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies, such as index funds or holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to get employer matches, then consider funding an IRA for additional tax advantages, and finally invest in taxable accounts as needed for liquidity and flexibility.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types across all accounts to balance risk and grow your investments.
- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations and contributions regularly based on your financial situation, goals, and any changes in tax laws.

### Consult a Professional:
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
