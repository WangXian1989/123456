The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically has higher contribution limits and may offer employer matching. It is tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions or earnings until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs being tax-deferred and Roth IRAs allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax benefits but offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before investing in other accounts.
   - Contribute to your IRA, especially if you can take advantage of tax deductions or tax-free growth options (like a Roth IRA).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Assess your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
   - Taxable accounts might be more suitable for funds you may need before retirement age.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor to help tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance that fits your overall financial strategy, ensuring you make the most of tax benefits and investment opportunities.
