(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money". 

After maxing out any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, ideally a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Once you've maximized these tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts for additional investments. It's also wise to have a well-diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your situation.
