To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, make contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction on contributions.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, allocate funds to taxable accounts.
   - Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, since they tend to have lower turnover and incur fewer capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across these accounts.
   - Maintain a balanced approach to asset allocation—stocks, bonds, and other securities—according to your financial goals.

4. **Rebalancing and Tax Management**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Be mindful of tax implications in your taxable account—strategize sales to minimize capital gains taxes.

Overall, the key is to take full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts while allowing for liquidity and flexibility in your taxable accounts.
