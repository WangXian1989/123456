To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize funding your tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your overall returns.

3. **Consider the Tax Treatment of Investments**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Consider holding bonds or other interest-generating investments in these accounts to defer taxes on interest income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free if qualified. This makes it a good place for investments expected to grow significantly, such as stocks.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't have tax advantages, so focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Make sure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. You might choose to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your Roth IRA and 401(k) while keeping safer, income-generating investments (like bonds) in the taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're closer to retirement, you might want to shift towards safer investments in all accounts. If youâ€™re younger, a more aggressive strategy might be appropriate.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy tailored to your situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial goals.

Always remember to review your strategy periodically to adjust to any changes in your financial situation or goals.
