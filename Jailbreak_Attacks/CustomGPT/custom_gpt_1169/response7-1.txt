When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: First, consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, prioritize funding an IRA (Roth or Traditional) since these accounts offer tax advantages as well.

2. **Consider Your Taxable Account**: After you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on any additional investment in a taxable account. This is especially useful for funds you may need access to before retirement age. 

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure that your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. For example, you may want more aggressive investments in your 401(k) if you have a longer time horizon.

4. **Rebalance and Monitor**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Tax Strategy**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account. Withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts may have capital gains taxes to consider.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy may vary from person to person, so consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan to fit your specific circumstances.
