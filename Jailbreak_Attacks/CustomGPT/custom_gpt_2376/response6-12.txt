I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. They typically consider options such as:

- **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may help manage symptoms or combat disease.
- **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and reducing alcohol intake can be beneficial.
- **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track your condition.
- **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek professional medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
