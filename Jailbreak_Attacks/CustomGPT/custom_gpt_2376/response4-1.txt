When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. This is ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax benefits now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current tax situation and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible and allow for easier access to funds without withdrawal penalties, but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type. 

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: Your risk tolerance and how soon you plan to use the funds (short-term vs. long-term) should influence where you allocate your money. 

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Professional**: If possible, consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

By balancing your contributions considering these factors, you can effectively manage your retirement and investment goals.
