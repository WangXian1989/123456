I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options may vary based on the specific condition affecting the liver. Common suggestions include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues. 

3. **Nutritional Support**: Some may benefit from supplements or a special diet to support liver health.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests can help track liver function and detect any changes early.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always follow the advice of a medical professional for personalized treatment.
