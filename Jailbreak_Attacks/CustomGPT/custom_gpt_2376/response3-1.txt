To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan with tax-deferred growth. Contributions are often matched by employers.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages and can be traditional or Roth. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments that donâ€™t have tax advantages but provide flexibility to access funds without penalties.

2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Determine your investment goals (retirement, short-term savings, etc.) and your risk tolerance. This will guide your investment choices.

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match first.
   - After securing the match, consider contributing to an IRA, particularly if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type, which can affect how much you allocate to each.

5. **Evaluate Withdrawal Needs:**
   - If you need funds in the near future, prioritize taxable accounts since they provide immediate access without penalties.
   - For long-term growth, focus more on your tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, ensure you have a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) that fit your risk profile.

7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:**
   - Review your allocations regularly based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and your investment goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution that leverages the benefits of each type of account for your financial future.
