To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually offers tax benefits and often includes employer matching. It's a good place to prioritize contributions, especially to get the full employer match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages as well. Depending on your income, you might qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible and allow for withdrawals at any time without penalties, but you will pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Once you max out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, this account can provide tax-free growth.
   - Use any remaining funds to invest in your taxable account for more flexibility and access to funds.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re far from retirement, you might take on more risk in your 401(k) and IRA since you have time to recover from market fluctuations.
   - For shorter-term goals, focus on more stable investments in your taxable account.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of each account. For example, you might want to place bonds (which generate interest income taxed as ordinary income) in your 401(k) or IRA while keeping stocks that may generate capital gains in your taxable account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you feel uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced strategy that considers taxes, growth potential, and your financial goals.
