When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your savings grow more efficiently. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while gains in taxable accounts are taxed at capital gains rates. Depending on your income level, you may want to balance your investments in a way that minimizes your overall tax burden.

3. **Investment Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Consider putting more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-free. Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments to minimize taxable capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in an easily accessible account before investing heavily.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Monitor your investments and retirement goals regularly. Adjust your allocations as needed based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your personal financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
