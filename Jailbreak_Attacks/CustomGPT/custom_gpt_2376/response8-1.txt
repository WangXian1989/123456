To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on this money until you withdraw it in retirement. 
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement), you can plan your contributions based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals. Consider placing investments with high growth potential or those that generate qualified dividends in these accounts for better tax treatment.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**: Different types of investments might be better suited for each account:
   - **401(k)**: Good for long-term growth investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, since you'll be taxed less during withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), consider a mix of bonds and stocks based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that yield capital gains or dividends, keeping in mind the tax implications.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before committing a significant amount to retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid savings account to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Regularly Reassess**: Periodically review and maybe rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

It's often advisable to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your unique financial situation and goals.
