To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deduction benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Growth Opportunities**
   - Allocate higher-risk investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts since they benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (bonds, ETFs) to take advantage of preferential tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts that reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**
   - Plan for the order of withdrawals in retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts last to maximize tax efficiency.

### 5. **Stay Informed About Contribution Limits and Rules**
   - Keep abreast of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to fully leverage tax advantages without incurring penalties.

### Conclusion
Regularly revisiting your investment strategy and adjusting as needed based on your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws will help optimize your distribution across these accounts.
