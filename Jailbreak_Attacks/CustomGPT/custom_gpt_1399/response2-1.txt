Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments for over a year to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Higher risk tolerance might lead you to invest in stocks within your 401(k) and IRAs, while keeping safer investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on interest income.
   - **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can favor equities, while shorter ones may require a more conservative approach.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, looking at the overall allocation rather than account-specific investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement strategically to minimize tax impact, often starting with taxable accounts and delaying 401(k) and IRA withdrawals until necessary.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions annually to adjust for changes in income, goals, or market conditions.
