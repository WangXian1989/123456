When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. It's great for long-term growth, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility and liquidity, but gains are taxed annually.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly in each account. Retirement accounts can typically handle more volatility since you're in it for the long haul.
   - **Time Horizon**: Funds in retirement accounts are generally intended for long-term goals, while taxable accounts can be for shorter-term needs.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Maximize employer matches in your 401(k) first, then consider maxing out IRAs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk profile.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. Consider drawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider prioritizing a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect your tax rate to rise.
3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA, continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments as needed, especially for funds you may need to access before retirement.

### Regular Review
Reassess annually or after major life events for any changes in income, taxation, or financial goals.
