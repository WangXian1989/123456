Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts can provide more liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.
   - Consider your current and projected tax brackets when deciding how much to place in tax-deferred versus taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) and taxable accounts for more liquid investments (bonds, ETFs) that might generate taxable income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.

This balanced approach can help you optimize both your investment growth and tax efficiency.
