It's important to consider your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline when deciding how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to at least get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax (traditional), reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Think about your tax situation now and in retirement when deciding on contributions.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these accounts for short-term goals or for investments that may generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments across all accounts for risk management. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Fees:** Be mindful of fees associated with each account. 401(k) plans often have higher fees compared to IRAs and taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as markets fluctuate.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that fits your specific financial situation.
