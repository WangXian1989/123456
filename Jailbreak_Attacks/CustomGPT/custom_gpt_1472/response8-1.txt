The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking full advantage of employer matching, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Pay Attention to Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and over), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and over).

4. **Tax Considerations**: Distribute funds in a way that considers your current and expected future tax rates. Contributions to traditional accounts are tax-deductible now but taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Use them for more flexible investments, but be wary of capital gains taxes when selling assets for a profit.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions. Adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your retirement goals.
