The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: After optimizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: If you are in a higher tax bracket, you might prioritize pre-tax contributions to your 401(k) or Traditional IRA. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA could be more beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement. This is especially useful for shorter-term goals like buying a house or funding education.

5. **Assess Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon—higher-risk assets in accounts with longer-term horizons can be appropriate.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, as they generally generate fewer taxable events. Consider holding higher-yield bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

7. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Your financial situation can change, so review your distribution strategy annually to ensure it aligns with your current circumstances, goals, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.

Remember, each person's financial situation is different, so it's important to tailor these strategies to fit your own needs and goals.
