The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. They often offer tax advantages that can help you grow your savings more efficiently.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. Taxable accounts may be best for investments that generate less frequent or qualified dividends.

4. **Consider Your Timeline**: If you need access to funds before retirement, keep some funds in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes, regardless of the account type. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: If you have losses in your taxable accounts, you can sell those investments to offset gains, which can be a smart tax strategy.

It's always wise to consult a financial advisor tailored to your personal situation for specific guidance!
