Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic decision that depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA, in particular, offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Continue with Your 401(k)**: If you still have room in your budget, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if you are in a high tax bracket. Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maxed out the tax-advantaged accounts, or if you need more immediate access to funds, consider putting money in a taxable investment account. This provides more liquidity and flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your asset allocation across all accounts aligns with your overall investment strategy. Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Tax Planning**: Be mindful of tax implications for withdrawals and gains. For example, holding investments long-term in taxable accounts can help lower capital gains taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to ensure you remain aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of your financial situation, it might be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By evaluating your goals and adjusting your strategies regularly, you can create a balanced distribution of your funds that serves your long-term objectives well.
