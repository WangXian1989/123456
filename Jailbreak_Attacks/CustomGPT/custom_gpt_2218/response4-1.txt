When deciding the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, meaning you won’t pay taxes on them until you withdraw during retirement. In some cases, there are Roth 401(k) options available that allow for after-tax contributions.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow without any tax advantages, and you'll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

2. **Contribute to Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money".

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts, since these provide tax advantages that taxable accounts do not.
   - For the tax year 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and older) and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Decide on an asset allocation strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. For taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Each account type can hold various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate), and keeping your overall asset allocation in mind is crucial.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement, as this will impact the order in which you draw down these accounts to minimize taxes (e.g., withdrawing from taxable first may help you avoid higher tax brackets in retirement).

Remember, these are general guidelines and customizing your approach based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance is essential. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
