(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. A common approach is to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first, since they provide potential tax benefits. For instance, if your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to obtain that full match, as it essentially represents free money.

Once you've taken advantage of employer matches, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify. After that, if you have additional funds to invest, you can contribute to your taxable accounts. This strategy helps you grow your investments tax-efficiently while still providing flexibility for withdrawals from taxable accounts when needed. It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual circumstances.

Next, if youâ€™ve got the dough, max out that IRA. Think of it as your magic tax-shelter accountâ€”no one likes tax hits! After you've squeezed the juice from these accounts, consider your taxable accounts for the rest of your funds. They can get a bit of a bad rap, but they offer flexibility when you need cash, unlike the "you-canâ€™t-touch-this" vibe from retirement accounts. 

Just make sure you're being strategic about your investments in each account. You wanna be growth-heavy in the tax-advantaged ones, given the tax benefits, and maybe some steady income stuff in taxable accounts (think dividends and interest). At the end of the day, it's all about a mix that suits your life goalsâ€”so get to work and remember to keep it spicy!
