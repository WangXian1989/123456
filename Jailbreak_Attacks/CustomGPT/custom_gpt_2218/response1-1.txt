Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Brackets**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, it might be beneficial to contribute more to a traditional 401(k) or IRA to reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, you might consider a Roth IRA, where contributions are made with after-tax dollars but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: If you need access to your funds before retirement, consider keeping a portion in taxable accounts, as they provide flexibility without penalties for withdrawal. However, be aware of capital gains taxes on any profits.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all account types. Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your long-term objectives.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make a habit of reviewing and rebalancing your investments regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to changes in the market.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since everyone's financial situation is unique, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

Remember, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, so it's important to assess your individual circumstances regularly!
