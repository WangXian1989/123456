To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

### 1. Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Contribute as much as you can to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Employer Match**: Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any available employer match.

### 2. Asset Location Strategy
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
     - Place higher growth investments (like stocks) here to defer taxes on gains.
     - Consider holding bonds or stable investments in these accounts for potential tax efficiency.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Focus on income-generating assets that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.
     - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset capital gains.

### 3. Diversification
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, alternatives) within each account to manage risk effectively.

### Additional Considerations
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you will withdraw from each account during retirement to minimize tax impact.
   - **Future Tax Rates**: Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when choosing between traditional and Roth options.

### Regular Review
   - Periodically review and readjust your allocations based on your life circumstances, financial goals, and market conditions.

Implementing these strategies can help you maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities, ultimately supporting your long-term financial goals.
