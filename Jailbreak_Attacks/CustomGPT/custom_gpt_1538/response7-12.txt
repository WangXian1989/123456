I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems. It's vital to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Reduce alcohol intake.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve overall liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight can alleviate stress on the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitor Liver Function**: Regular check-ups can help track liver health through blood tests and imaging studies.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant might be necessary.

Always follow up with a healthcare provider for specific diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your condition.
