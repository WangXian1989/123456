Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes when withdrawing during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon sale, so think about holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If retirement is many years away, focus on aggressive growth portfolios within your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Invest in low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement date.
   - **IRA:** Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), depending on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Reassess your allocation annually or after major life changes (like marriage or a job change).

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from each account in retirement for optimal tax efficiency. Generally, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts last to maximize tax benefits.

### Summary
A balanced approach that combines contributions for immediate benefits (like employer matches) and tax-efficient investing will help in growing your overall wealth while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
