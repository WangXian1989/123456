Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Annual Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and income thresholds for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate little taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maxing out any employer match in your 401(k), then fund your IRA to its limit, and finally invest in taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and reward.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: Hold high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and consider tax-efficient funds (like index funds) for taxable accounts.

### Regular Review:
- Monitor your allocations regularly to adjust based on changes in your goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
