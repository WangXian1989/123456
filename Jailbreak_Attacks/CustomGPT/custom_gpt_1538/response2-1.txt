Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you strategize:

### 1. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if it offers tax benefits. Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your tax situation.

### 2. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Avoid placing high-turnover assets or taxable bonds here to minimize tax impacts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Considerations**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for your growth-oriented investments (stocks), as gains will not be taxed until withdrawal (401(k) or Traditional IRA) or not taxed at all (Roth IRA).
   - **Bonds and Stable Investments**: Consider placing fixed income or bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce the tax impact on interest income.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Life changes, market fluctuations, and changes in tax laws can impact your strategy. Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions.

### 5. **Consider Your Retirement Goals**:
   - Think about when you plan to retire and how youâ€™ll withdraw funds. This might influence where you allocate funds now.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your full financial picture, goals, and tax situation.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest remainder for flexibility and liquidity after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

This approach helps balance tax efficiency, growth potential, and flexibility.
