It's crucial to consider factors such as your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals when determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Generally, it's a good strategy to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, then consider your IRA options, and finally allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility. Diversifying investments based on their tax implications and your liquidity needs will also be beneficial. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation.
