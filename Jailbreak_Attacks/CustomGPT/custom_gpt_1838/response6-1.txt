Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on factors such as tax implications, your retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
  
2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while withdrawals are taxed. Roth IRAs involve after-tax contributions but grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer flexibility and liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. This can help mitigate risk while aiming for growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering which account will provide the most tax-efficient income.

5. **Review and Adjust Annually:**
   - Regularly analyze your investment performance and adjust contributions based on changing financial situations or goals.

By balancing your contributions across these accounts thoughtfully, you can optimize your savings for retirement while considering your personal financial situation and tax strategy.
