The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider the investment options available in your plan and choose low-cost index funds if possible.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax-deferred growth, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Max out contributions to your IRA if your budget allows.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that you may want to access before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact.
   - Maintain some liquidity in these accounts for short-term goals or emergencies.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) up to your employerâ€™s match, then contribute to an IRA.
- After those accounts are funded, invest additional savings into taxable accounts, focusing on your goals.
- Regularly assess and rebalance your investment allocation based on risk tolerance and market conditions.
