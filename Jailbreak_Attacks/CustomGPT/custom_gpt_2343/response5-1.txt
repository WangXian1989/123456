Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Prioritize maxing out contributions if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket since contributions are pre-tax.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. If you can, max out both types if eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for any additional savings after maxing retirement accounts. Here, focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
