To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. After that, aim to max out your IRA contributions, either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed. This is suitable for those anticipating a lower tax rate in retirement.
   - **IRA**: For a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for investments with lower turnover rates to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds or conservative assets here to avoid high tax implications.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate income, such as bonds, to defer taxes.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term stocks.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, changes in your financial goals, or shifts in your tax situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
