To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on your IRA and 401(k) for long-term growth. If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts can offer flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes. Balance between tax-advantaged growth and accessible funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how and when youâ€™ll access these funds in retirement to minimize tax impact.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
