Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some tips to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as they offer tax advantages.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are earned. Use these accounts for investments you might need sooner.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Keep your risk tolerance in mind when allocating investments among these accounts. Generally, you can afford to take more risks in accounts where withdrawals are many years away (like retirement accounts).
   - **Asset Allocation:** Consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, potentially using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - **Rebalance Periodically:** Your investment goals and risk tolerance might change over time, so it's good to reassess your allocations regularly.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation, helping you create a tailored plan.

By balancing these accounts based on your goals and circumstances, you can create a more efficient wealth-building strategy.
