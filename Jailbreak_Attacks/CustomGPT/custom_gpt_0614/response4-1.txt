Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general considerations to guide your allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributions to a 401(k) or Traditional IRA are often tax-deductible, while withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on capital gains when you sell investments and on dividends received. Consider keeping investments with high turnover or interest income in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments with the potential for high growth (like stocks) to maximize tax benefits.
   - Consider holding bonds or less volatile investments in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocation to maintain your desired risk level and to take advantage of market conditions.

6. **Consider Your Timeline:**
   - If retirement is far off, you might prioritize higher-risk investments. If you’re closer to retirement, focus on preserving capital.
