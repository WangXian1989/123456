Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Assess Eligibility**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and start maxing out if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Pay off any high-interest debts before heavily investing.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired allocation.

### Consult a Professional:
Consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your unique circumstances.
