Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider your tax situation: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth 401(k) contributions provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Choose between Traditional and Roth: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial because withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, a Traditional IRA offers immediate tax benefits.
   - Max out contributions: For 2024, the contribution limit is typically $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50). Aim to reach this limit if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals: These accounts are best for funds you may need before retirement or for goals like buying a house or financing education.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments: Utilize index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains and taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments (like stocks) can go into retirement accounts, while more conservative investments can be in taxable accounts.
- **Regular Contributions**: Establish automatic contributions to all accounts to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

### Final Tip:
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice to tailor your distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
