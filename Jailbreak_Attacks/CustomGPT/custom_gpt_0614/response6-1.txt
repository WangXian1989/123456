Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the benefits and tax implications of each account type. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to meet any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Traditional IRA may offer a tax deduction, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you plan to sell within a year or for discretionary income needs. They are less tax-advantaged but offer more liquidity.

### 3. **Determine Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term Goals:** Invest primarily in tax-advantaged accounts for retirement; heavier allocation in stocks.
   - **Short-term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or safer assets.

### Summary:
- **Contribute to 401(k) up to the employer match.**
- **Max out your IRA contributions (consider which type based on income and tax situation).**
- **Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and immediate needs.** 

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your circumstances.
