Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Focus on utilizing your 401(k) for its tax-deferred benefits, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA**: 
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you meet the income limits, as this offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA can be beneficial for its immediate tax deduction benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable investment accounts for savings goals that are shorter-term or for assets that may generate a lot of taxable income.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable events.

4. **General Guidelines**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place first.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and market changes.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
