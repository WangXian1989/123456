Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, investment goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, especially if you receive a match. Consider whether your plan has high fees.
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, assess whether a Traditional or Roth IRA suits you better. A Roth IRA is beneficial for younger investors anticipating higher tax rates in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: 
   - If youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts and have savings beyond that, consider putting money into a taxable investment account.
   - Taxable accounts are flexible but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For example, you might hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and allocate bonds or stable investments in a taxable account to benefit from lower tax rates on dividends and interest.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before aggressively investing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

Reevaluating your distribution periodically and adjusting as needed based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws is also essential.
