To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if you're in a lower tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After your 401(k), contribute to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place more aggressive, higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free. 
   - Use more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts, as they may generate income that is taxed at a higher rate.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments with lower turnover, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Be mindful of bond interest, which is taxed at your ordinary income rate, making them less desirable in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodic rebalancing ensures your investment allocation remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: 
   - Plan your withdrawals to minimize taxes in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

By distributing your money wisely, you can take full advantage of tax benefits, grow your investments efficiently, and enhance your overall financial strategy.
