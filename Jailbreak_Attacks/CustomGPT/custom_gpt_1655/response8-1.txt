**Money Distribution Strategy for Retirement Accounts**

**Assess Your Financial Goals and Situation**
Before making any decisions, consider your overall financial goals, investment timeline, risk tolerance, and tax implications.

**1. 401(k) Accounts**
- **Contribution Rate**: Aim to contribute at least enough to receive any employer match, as this is free money.
- **Investment Options**: Select a mix of investments based on your risk tolerance.
  
**2. IRA Accounts**
- **Types of IRAs**: Depending on your income, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxable withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments in the IRA similar to your 401(k).

**3. Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquid Assets**: Keep a portion of your money in taxable accounts for liquidity and short-term needs.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, which usually yield lower capital gains distributions.

**Allocation Strategy**
- **Equal Distribution**: Start with equal contributions across all accounts.
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts first, particularly if youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket.

**Periodic Review**
- Regularly reassess and adjust your distribution strategy according to changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your personal financial situation.
