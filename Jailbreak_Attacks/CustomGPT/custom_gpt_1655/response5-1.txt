(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This can provide immediate returns. After maximizing the 401(k), consider funding a Roth or traditional IRA, which can have tax advantages. Lastly, putting additional funds into taxable accounts may allow for greater flexibility, focusing on investments that suit your risk tolerance and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
