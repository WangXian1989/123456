Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

**1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**  
   **Subheader:** Secure “free” money  
   **Content:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money added to your retirement savings.

**2. Fund Roth IRA (if eligible):**  
   **Subheader:** Tax-free growth potential  
   **Content:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if your income allows. This account allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

**3. Fill Up Additional 401(k) Contribution Limits:**  
   **Subheader:** Tax-deferred growth  
   **Content:** If you can still contribute after receiving the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions for tax-deferred growth.

**4. Contribute to Traditional IRA (if Roth is maxed):**  
   **Subheader:** Additional retirement savings  
   **Content:** If you're still within your contribution limits, consider putting money into a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

**5. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**  
   **Subheader:** Access before retirement  
   **Content:** Once you've maximized retirement accounts, consider a taxable account for investments you might need access to before retirement age without penalties.

**6. Consider Asset Allocation:**  
   **Subheader:** Diversification strategy  
   **Content:** Allocate different types of investments (stocks, bonds, REITs) based on your risk tolerance across accounts. Typically, higher-risk assets might be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

**7. Review Regularly:**  
   **Subheader:** Adjust as needed  
   **Content:** Regularly review your distributions and contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, financial goals, and market conditions.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
