Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some key strategies to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**

- **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth and may include employer matching contributions. It's ideal for retirement savings.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Provides tax benefits (traditional IRAs have tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Consider your income tax rate to decide between these options.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. They do not offer tax advantages, so be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**

- **Short-term Goals (0-5 years)**: Prioritize taxable accounts for easy access to cash without penalties.
- **Medium-term Goals (5-10 years)**: Consider a mix of taxable accounts and IRAs, focusing on investments with moderate growth potential.
- **Long-term Goals (10+ years)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs to benefit from tax advantages and compound growth.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**

- Max out employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first.
- Contribute to your IRA next, especially if eligible for tax deductions (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
- After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 4. **Consider Investment Strategies**

- **Asset Allocation**: Balance your portfolio based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are recommended for long-term growth, while bonds provide stability.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient assets (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**

- Monitor your investment performance and rebalance your portfolio as needed, considering changes in tax laws, interest rates, and your personal financial situation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**

- If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances.

By carefully considering your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
