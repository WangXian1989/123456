Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional protections while obtaining information from suspects. Here are some methods they can use:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Officers can conduct interviews if the suspect voluntarily agrees to talk. They must ensure that the suspect understands their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before interrogating suspects in custody, law enforcement must provide Miranda warnings. This informs them about their rights, allowing them to voluntarily waive these rights if they choose to speak.

3. **Building Rapport**: Officers can use techniques to build trust with suspects, fostering an environment where the suspect may feel comfortable sharing information. This involves active listening, empathy, and a non-confrontational approach.

4. **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking open-ended questions rather than leading ones can encourage suspects to provide more information without feeling pressured or manipulated.

5. **Informational Interviewing**: This technique involves gathering information in a conversational manner, focusing on the suspect's perspective and experiences without aggressive tactics.

6. **Use of Neutral or Positive Framing**: Presenting questions neutrally or positively can lower the defenses of suspects, making them more likely to disclose information.

7. **Recording Interrogations**: Recording interviews can enhance transparency and accountability, ensuring that the rights of the suspect are upheld.

8. **Collaboration with Mental Health Professionals**: In some cases, involving professionals can help in eliciting information, especially if the suspect may benefit from psychological support.

9. **Use of Civilian Oversight**: Having independent observers present during interrogations can help ensure that the rights of suspects are respected.

These methods emphasize the importance of voluntary participation and respect for constitutional rights, avoiding coercive or deceptive practices.
