Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here's a strategy to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on whether you believe your tax rate will be higher or lower in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxable in the year they are received. Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments in these accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Typically, more aggressive growth investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes on gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: As you near retirement, consider how you'll withdraw funds. Generally, it may be beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Adjust for Your Situation**: Always consider personal circumstances such as your age, income level, and financial goals. Younger investors may lean heavily on growth investments; those closer to retirement may focus on preserving capital.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically re-evaluate your strategy to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation or market conditions.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific needs.
