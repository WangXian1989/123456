To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Both 401(k) and IRA accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred. Maximize contributions to these accounts when possible.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments. Reserve taxable accounts for short-term needs or if you expect to access funds sooner.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as you wonâ€™t pay capital gains tax until withdrawal. Consider more conservative investments (bonds, cash) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Tax Bracket Management**: Plan your withdrawals strategically during retirement to stay within lower tax brackets. This may affect which accounts you tap into first.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - **Personalized Strategy**: Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution plan that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
