To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high contribution limit, prioritize this up to the employer match, and then consider maxing it out.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. If eligible, aim for the maximum contribution limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds here can be accessed without penalties anytime. If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts, focusing on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider investing in funds with higher growth potential since you won’t be paying taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Diversify with a mix of stocks and bonds, similar to your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to manage your tax burden.

5. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If possible, work with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your goals.

This thoughtful approach can maximize your savings and growth potential over time. Would you like more detailed guidance on any specific area?
