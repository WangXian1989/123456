3. **Peer Influence**: Leverage the influence of social networks by involving young leaders or influencers to amplify your message. Authentic voices can help build trust and engagement.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Create interactive experiences, like polls, quizzes, or community events, to foster participation and discussion among young voters.

5. **Accessible Information**: Ensure that information about the voting process, including registration and polling locations, is easy to find and understand. Use video tutorials and infographics for clarity.
