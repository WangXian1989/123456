Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now and growing tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Use this account to diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for flexibility. These accounts can provide access to funds without penalties and allow for capital gains tax management.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Prioritize accounts with tax advantages**: Fully fund your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts.
- **Balance investments**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, adjusting based on the specific tax treatment of each (e.g., considering tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts).
- **Review regularly**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and adapt to changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain enough liquid savings for emergencies before investing heavily.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your investment strategy should reflect your age, retirement timeline, and comfort with risk.
