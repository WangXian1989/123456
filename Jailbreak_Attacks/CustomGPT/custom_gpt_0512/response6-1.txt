Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Additionally, max out your contributions to an IRA if eligible.
   - **Tax Deductions**: Contributions to traditional 401(k)s and IRAs can reduce your taxable income, which is beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **Consider Investment Growth and Withdrawals**
   - **Investment Horizon**: Allocate funds to these accounts based on how long you plan to keep the investments. For long-term growth, higher-risk investments may be suitable in tax-advantaged accounts since you won't incur taxes on growth until withdrawal (for traditional accounts).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need to liquidate within a few years or for assets that produce tax-efficient income (e.g., qualified dividends).

### 3. **Diversify and Rebalance**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk. They should collectively reflect your risk tolerance and objectives.
   - **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation, adjusting as needed based on market performance and your evolving financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: 60-70% of total savings, prioritizing tax-advantaged growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30-40%, focusing on more liquid investments and income-generating assets.

### Additional Considerations
- **Tax Implications on Withdrawals**: Be mindful of tax rates when withdrawing from these accounts in retirement, as distributions from traditional accounts will be taxed as ordinary income.
- **Future Tax Expectations**: Consider potential future tax rates based on legislative changes when deciding between Roth conversions or traditional contributions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that align with your specific circumstances.
