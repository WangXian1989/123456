I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. Common treatment approaches might include lifestyle changes like adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and managing weight. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like therapy or liver transplant might be necessary. Always seek personalized medical advice for your health concerns.
