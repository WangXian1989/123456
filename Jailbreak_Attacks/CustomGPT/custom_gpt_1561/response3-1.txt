The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for needing the funds. Here are some general guidelines to help you with your allocation:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize your employer's match, if available, as this is essentially free money. 
   - Consider increasing your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. 
   - Depending on your income, it may be beneficial to contribute to a Roth 401(k) if offered, for tax-free growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA allows for tax deductions on contributions.
   - Consider how your income and tax bracket will play into which type of IRA to prioritize.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for any extra savings or investments after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - Taxable accounts are more flexible, allowing access to funds without penalty, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on realized profits.

4. **Consider Your Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure that across all accounts, your investments align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy (stocks, bonds, cash, etc.).
   - Diversify your portfolio by utilizing different asset classes available in each type of account.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it still meets your financial goals as market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can create a tailored strategy based on your unique financial situation.

By strategically distributing your funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax advantages and investment growth potential.
