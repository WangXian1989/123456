The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, investment time horizon, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older)

3. **Prioritize Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or for income-generating investments, as they do not offer the tax advantages of the retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified within each account type. Consider your risk tolerance and investment strategy when selecting assets.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider how and when you might need to access your funds. For example, early withdrawals from a 401(k) or IRA may incur penalties, while taxable accounts can provide more flexibility without penalties.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the right distribution for your specific situation, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts in a way that aligns with your financial objectives.
