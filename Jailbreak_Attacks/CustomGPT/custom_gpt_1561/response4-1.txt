Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and taxes on earnings are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Although you pay taxes on any capital gains and dividends in the year they are realized, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: Choose investments that align with your risk profile in each account. Younger investors might lean towards aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while conservative investments might suit taxable accounts better, especially to manage taxable events.

4. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have liquid savings in taxable accounts for short-term needs, separate from your retirement accounts.

5. **Long-Term Horizon for Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize long-term growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA as these accounts are designed for retirement.

6. **Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of pre-tax, post-tax (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility in withdrawals and tax management in retirement.

In summary, a balanced approach prioritizing employer matches and tax considerations while aligning with your long-term growth strategies will help optimize your funds across these accounts. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your specific situation.
