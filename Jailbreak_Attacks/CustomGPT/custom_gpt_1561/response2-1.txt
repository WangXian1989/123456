Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline to help you consider the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, taxes will be owed on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that generate tax-advantaged income, like long-term capital gains. Be mindful of the tax implications when selling investments.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Focus on more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Hold more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that you're diversifying your investments across all accounts. Don’t just replicate the same investments in each account type.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so revisit your allocation strategy annually.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you’re uncertain, a professional can provide personalized guidance.

This approach aims for a balance between maximizing tax benefits and maintaining liquidity to meet your financial goals.
