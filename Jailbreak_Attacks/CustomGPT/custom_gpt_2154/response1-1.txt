Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA can be beneficial. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for higher contributions and tax-deferred growth. Be mindful of fees.
   - **IRA**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, a traditional IRA might be preferable. Conversely, a Roth IRA could be better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high dividends or interest, as they will be taxed at your ordinary income rate. Capital gains from long-term investments are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your investments and redistribute funds as needed based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or market conditions.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
