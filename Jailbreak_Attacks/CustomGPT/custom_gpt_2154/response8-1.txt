Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Once you've secured your employer match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax strategy.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or Roth post-tax). Focus on this account for higher income years to lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Assess whether a Traditional or Roth IRA suits you better based on immediate vs. future tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may produce taxable income, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement. Tax-efficient investment strategies can help minimize taxes here.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in tax laws, investment performance, and personal circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can further optimize your investment strategy. 

This distribution strategy can help you balance growth potential with tax efficiency.
