The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize this until you reach the match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

4. **Consider Taxes and Growth Potential**: 
   - Investments in your 401(k) and IRA grow tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). In taxable accounts, be mindful of capital gains tax.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as long-term stocks or municipal bonds.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes suitable for your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or life events.
