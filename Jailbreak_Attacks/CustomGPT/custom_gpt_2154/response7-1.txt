To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Maximize contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Choose appropriate investments**: Look for low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement goals.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Consider tax implications**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes will be paid on withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Max out contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 for 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for flexibility**: These accounts allow you to withdraw funds without penalties, which can be useful for unexpected expenses.
   - **Invest tax-efficiently**: Choose investments that minimize capital gains, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### 4. **General Considerations**
   - **Diversify your investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to reduce risk.
   - **Adjust based on goals**: Your risk tolerance, age, and financial goals should inform your asset allocation. Younger investors may lean more towards stocks, while older investors might prefer bonds.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Engage with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual situation, as they can help optimize your strategy considering taxes, fees, and investment options specific to your accounts.
