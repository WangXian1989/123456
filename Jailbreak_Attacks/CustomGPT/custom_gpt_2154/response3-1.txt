Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**

- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if in a high tax bracket.
- **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions. Max out contributions here after your 401(k) if possible.

### 2. **Asset Location Strategy**

- **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that are tax-efficient here, such as index funds or municipal bonds, which generate fewer taxable events. Avoid high-turnover funds or bonds that generate regular interest.
- **Retirement Accounts**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for assets that may generate higher returns but also higher short-term tax consequences, like REITs or actively managed funds.

### 3. **Diversification**

Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes. Avoid duplicating investments in different accounts to maintain balanced risk across them.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**

Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, especially after significant market movements.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawals**

Plan for future withdrawals, considering tax implications. Funds in taxable accounts may be more accessible without penalties compared to early withdrawals from retirement accounts, which often incur taxes and penalties.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**

Finally, meet with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts according to your financial needs.
