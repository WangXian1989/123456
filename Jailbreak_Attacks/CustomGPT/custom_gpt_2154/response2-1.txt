Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your employer match, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) depending on your tax situation.
   - If your income qualifies, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments, especially for goals that are shorter-term or require flexibility.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - In higher tax brackets, prioritize tax-deferment (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to reduce your current taxable income.
   - In lower brackets, Roth accounts may provide a tax advantage.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account. Itâ€™s often beneficial to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Evaluate Withdrawals and Contributions**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals based on your retirement plans and age.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Market conditions, tax laws, and personal circumstances change, so regularly reassess your strategy.
