To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth; contributions may be matched by your employer.
   - **IRA:** Also tax-deferred; consider traditional vs. Roth based on your current vs. future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains; useful for shorter-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Saving**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** Depending on your income, fully fund your traditional or Roth IRA next; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Invest any additional savings here for goals within the next few years.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth assets (stocks, mutual funds) due to tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize conservative investments (bonds, dividend-paying stocks) to manage tax liabilities effectively.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-efficient Funds:** Use index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.
   - **Harvest Losses:** Consider tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**
   - **Younger Individuals:** More aggressive growth focus in 401(k) and IRA; balance in taxable accounts.
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift toward more stable, income-generating securities.

### Conclusion
Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, tax law, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
