Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you qualify for Roth contributions, these can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if possible.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can be subject to capital gains taxes when sold, so consider holding long-term for lower rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Different accounts can hold different types of investments based on tax efficiency.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Emergency Savings**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation can change, so reassess your distribution strategy periodically.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice specific to your situation.
