When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general guideline that might help:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. These accounts offer tax advantages that can help your money grow more efficiently. Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding between Traditional (pre-tax contributions) and Roth (after-tax contributions) IRAs.

3. **Contribute to 401(k) to the Limit**: After taking advantage of the employer match, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you have additional funds available. This can help reduce your taxable income now (for Traditional plans).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Investments**: Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for accessing your funds without penalties, especially if you anticipate needing access to that money before retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. This can mean spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies.

6. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debts, consider paying those down first before making significant contributions, as the interest on debt typically outpaces investment returns.

7. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: Consult a tax advisor to review your unique situation since the tax implications of withdrawing funds from tax-deferred accounts during retirement can significantly impact your overall financial strategy.

8. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: As you get closer to retirement, it might be wise to gradually shift your asset allocation to lower-risk investments to preserve your savings.

It’s often advisable to review your investment strategy regularly to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals and life situation. Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Always remember to do your own research and consult with professionals when needed!
