It's essential to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Max out employer matching contributions first; that's free money. Then, consider contributing up to the annual limit if your employer offers a good investment lineup.

2. **IRA**: After your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may generate income or capital gains. This can include stocks, bonds, or real estate investments. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, that have lower turnover rates to minimize tax liability.

The allocation among these accounts can vary based on individual circumstances, so consulting with a financial advisor is advisable to tailor your strategy to your needs.

Always remember your asset allocation among these accounts should align with your overall investment strategy.
