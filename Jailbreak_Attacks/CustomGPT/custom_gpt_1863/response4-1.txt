Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here’s a simple breakdown:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Benefits**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth.
   - **Limitations**: Early withdrawal penalties before age 59½; limited investment choices.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions; taxes paid on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed; tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Benefits**: More investment choices; tax advantages.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: No contribution limits; access anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Pay capital gains taxes on earnings; less tax-advantaged.

### **Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts.
   - If you expect higher taxes, consider Roth accounts.
3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a portion in liquid cash in your taxable account for unexpected expenses.

### **Adjust Based on Life Changes**
- Regularly review and adjust your distribution based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
