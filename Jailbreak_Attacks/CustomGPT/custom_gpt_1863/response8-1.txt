Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce taxable income. Best for high-income years.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are taxed yearly; consider keeping bonds and other interest-generating assets here to minimize tax impact.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - Max out contributions to your employer's 401(k) to get the match (if available).
   - Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on tax strategy.
   - Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Timeframe**
   - **Long-term goals:** Focus on retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for compounding growth.
   - **Short-term goals:** Use taxable accounts for easier access to funds.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
   - Adjust asset allocation based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match (then consider contributing up to the annual limit).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions, prioritizing Roth if eligible based on income.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for goals in the next few years, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment.

### Final Tips
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation. This strategy should adjust as you near retirement or experience major life changes.
