### 2. **Medications**
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis (types B or C).
   - **Corticosteroids**: To manage autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Ursodeoxycholic Acid**: Used for conditions like primary biliary cholangitis.

### 3. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Regular blood tests to check liver function and monitor any liver disease progression.

### 4. **Surgery**
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.
