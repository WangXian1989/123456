Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your savings. Here’s a simple approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free" money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRAs**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may give you tax deductions now.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - Once you’ve contributed to your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest Any Additional Funds:** After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate extra savings to taxable accounts. This is great for flexibility, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for higher returns. Generally, it’s best to hold bonds and high-interest income in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically review your investments to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Summary:
- **Start with 401(k) match → IRA contributions → Max out 401(k) → Taxable accounts.** 

This order optimizes growth potential and tax efficiency.
