Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can boost your overall financial health. Hereâ€™s a simple guide:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA due to tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Investment Needs**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you may have more investment options. Balance growth and income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for short-to-medium-term goals. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

### 3. **Adjust According to Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

### Key Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains in taxable accounts.
- **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you have cash available for emergencies.

By strategically distributing your money across these types of accounts, you can optimize growth and minimize taxes.
