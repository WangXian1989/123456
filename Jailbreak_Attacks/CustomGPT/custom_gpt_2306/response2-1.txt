Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Here's a general approach:

1. **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you have lower fees than in your IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for assets that benefit from favorable capital gains treatment, like long-term investments. This can include stocks or ETFs.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. For example, interest from bonds may be taxed as ordinary income in taxable accounts, while qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess your contributions and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation changes.
