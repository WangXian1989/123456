Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) and IRA:**
     - These accounts often offer tax benefits. If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after the 401(k) match.
     - Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - In lower tax brackets, a Traditional IRA might offer more immediate tax savings.

### 4. **Balance Risk and Access**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawing funds but are taxed on capital gains and dividends.
   - Use these accounts for investments that might be needed sooner or for goals like buying a home or starting a business.

### 5. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Ensure your investment choices (stocks, bonds, etc.) reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

### 6. **Investment Goals and Time Frame**
   - Long-term retirement savings can be more aggressive (higher risk), while short-term goals require safer investments.

### 7. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Review your allocations annually or when significant financial changes occur. Adjust based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (up to match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if 50+)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings or investments based on liquidity needs.

### Final Thoughts
Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that considers your unique circumstances and goals.
