Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer matches first; this is effectively free money.
   - Contribute to the maximum limit if possible, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, contribute after maxing out your 401(k). This allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you’re looking to lower your taxable income now, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use this for short-term goals or for investments you might need to access before retirement. 
   - Given capital gains taxes, holding investments long-term in these accounts can be beneficial.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize contributions** based on tax advantages and your current tax situation.
- **Diversify** investments within each account type to manage risk and optimize growth.
- Reassess annually to adjust contributions as income and tax situations change. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide a personalized strategy.
