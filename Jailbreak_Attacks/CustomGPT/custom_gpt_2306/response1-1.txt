Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: If you have maxed out your IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions to your desired limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Consider Taxes on Withdrawals**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts and taxable accounts may have different tax implications.

5. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at lower rates.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

7. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation.
