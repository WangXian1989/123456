To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers higher contribution limits and may include employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs also allow for tax advantages but have lower contribution limits. Traditional IRAs provide tax deferral, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments that can be accessed without penalties; taxes are due on capital gains and dividends.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for Roth IRA benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After funding your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Evaluate which investments to hold in each account type to minimize taxes. For instance, consider placing high-growth stocks in Roth IRAs to avoid future taxes, while holding bonds or REITs in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your portfolio's performance and reallocate as needed to align with your target asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and personal financial situations, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
