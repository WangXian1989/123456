Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investing but come with capital gains taxes.

3. **Prioritize Accounts**:
   - Consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA if you qualify, as these often have more investment options than a 401(k).
   - If you have already maxed out your retirement accounts, contribute to your taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, youâ€™ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
