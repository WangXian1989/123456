Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow tax-deferred, but capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they are realized.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If you're saving for retirement (long-term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts where you can access them without penalty.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes and geographical regions to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized insights based on your entire financial picture.

This approach can help you develop a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
