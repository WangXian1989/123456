The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income level and tax circumstances. Prioritize the account that offers the best tax benefits for you.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA) delay taxes until withdrawal, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments that generate less frequent capital gains in these accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Different accounts can hold a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk.

4. **Adjust Based on Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Consider a strategy that minimizes taxes over time, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first or managing withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts strategically in retirement.

5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.  

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure how to allocate your investments, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

In summary, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider the tax implications of your investments, and maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types.
