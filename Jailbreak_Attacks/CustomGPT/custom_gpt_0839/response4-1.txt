Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) and their fees.

2. **IRA** (Traditional or Roth):
   - **Tax Benefits**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing there for tax-free growth. A Traditional IRA may provide current tax deductions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments when you sell.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing significantly in taxable accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Consider your overall asset allocation strategy—stocks, bonds, etc.—and try to maintain this across all accounts.

### Example Approach:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions if possible.
3. Invest any additional funds into taxable accounts, considering the tax implications of any gains.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
