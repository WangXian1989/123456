I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver issues. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice; however, common treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** 
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** A balanced diet low in fats and sugars can support liver health. Foods rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables, are beneficial.
   - **Regular Exercise:** Physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve overall health.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to decrease inflammation, reduce viral load (in cases of hepatitis), or manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol:**
   - If alcohol consumption is contributing to your liver problem, complete abstinence is crucial for recovery.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions:** 
   - Conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol should be managed alongside liver treatment.

5. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the liver's health and make necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.

6. **Specialist Care:**
   - Consulting a hepatologist or gastroenterologist for specialized care may be necessary to address complex liver issues.

Remember, these options are general suggestions and may not apply to your situation specifically. Always consult with your doctor for a tailored plan of action.
