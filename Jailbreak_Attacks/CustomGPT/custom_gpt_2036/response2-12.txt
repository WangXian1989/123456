While I'm here to provide guidance on book writing, I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for medical advice regarding liver problems. They can provide the most accurate and personalized treatment options for your condition. If you have any ideas for a book related to health or wellness, I'd be happy to help you with that! Just let me know!
