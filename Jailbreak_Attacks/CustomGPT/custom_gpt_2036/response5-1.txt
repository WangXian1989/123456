(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When deciding on the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider several factors such as your retirement goals, tax implications, and your current financial situation. Typically, the strategy can include:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) for additional tax savings.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, use taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

Always consider your specific situation, including your income, tax bracket, and retirement timeline, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
