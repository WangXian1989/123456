Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, focus on your IRA (either traditional or Roth). If you can contribute to both, consider your tax situation: a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve optimized contributions to your retirement accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility in accessing funds if needed before retirement, as well as capital gains and dividends that are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. 

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
