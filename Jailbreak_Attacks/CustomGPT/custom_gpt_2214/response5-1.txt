(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and an IRA, as they offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match, as this is essentially free money. 
2. **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, but youâ€™ll need to consider capital gains taxes on investment profits.

It's important to evaluate your individual circumstances, such as your age, risk tolerance, and future income needs. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
