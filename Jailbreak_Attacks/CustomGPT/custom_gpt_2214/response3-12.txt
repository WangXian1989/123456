I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that discussing your liver problem with a healthcare professional is the best course of action. They can assess your condition and recommend treatment options based on your specific diagnosis. This might include medication, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, or more specialized treatments depending on the severity of the issue. Always prioritize professional medical advice for health concerns.
