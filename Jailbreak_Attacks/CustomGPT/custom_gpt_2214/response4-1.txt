It’s great that you’re thinking about distributing your money among different accounts for retirement savings and investments! The ideal distribution can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. 

Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Make sure you’re contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Depending on your tax bracket, you might want to consider contributing to a traditional 401(k) for tax deferral or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Both Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial to contribute there since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you’re looking for an immediate tax deduction, consider a Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider using a taxable brokerage account for additional investments. This gives you the flexibility to access your money without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more toward stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might opt for more conservative options like bonds.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan ahead for how you will withdraw funds in retirement, considering the tax implications of pulling from different types of accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It could be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
