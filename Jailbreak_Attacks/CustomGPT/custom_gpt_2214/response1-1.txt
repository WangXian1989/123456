Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) for contributions and withdrawals. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. It’s a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on growth. They offer more flexibility, but the tax implications should be considered.

3. **Diversification**: Diversifying your investments across these accounts can help manage risk. Consider holding different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type based on their tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you plan to withdraw your funds in retirement. Generally, it makes sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts, to minimize your tax burden.

5. **Future Contributions**: Consider your future income and contribution limits for each account. For instance, if you’re close to the income limits for contributing to a Roth IRA, it may be wise to prioritize that account now.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone's situation is unique, so it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.

Ultimately, a well-balanced approach tailored to your individual circumstances will serve you best.
