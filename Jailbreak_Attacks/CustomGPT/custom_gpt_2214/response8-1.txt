The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Max Out Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**: After maxing out any match and contributing to an IRA, continue to fund your 401(k) to maximize your retirement savings. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if you can afford it.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've met your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in a taxable account for additional flexibility. This can be useful if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, as they may generate less taxable income. Higher-income generating assets (like bonds) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

Remember to review your overall financial picture regularly and adjust your contributions as your situation changes. Consulting a financial advisor may also provide personalized advice tailored to your needs.
