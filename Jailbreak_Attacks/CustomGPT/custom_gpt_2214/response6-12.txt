   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition, medications to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.
   - Supplements such as vitamins or herbs might be recommended, but always consult a doctor first.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like endoscopy or surgery may be required.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Keeping track of liver function tests and follow-ups with a healthcare provider.

For the best outcome, please seek medical advice tailored to your specific condition.
