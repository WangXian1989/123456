Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering tax implications, contribution limits, and your financial goals. Here are some strategies to optimize your distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing this up to the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you can, contribute to an IRA after you max out your 401(k) contributions. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies for Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are suitable for goals that may occur before retirement or for funds needed for short-term needs. You can withdraw from these accounts without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

3. **Diversification and Investment Choices:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Taxable accounts may benefit from tax-loss harvesting, while tax-advantaged accounts can focus on long-term growth without immediate tax concerns.

4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation. Adjust your contributions and investment strategies as needed to ensure they align with your retirement goals and tax situation.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize growth and minimize tax liabilities over time.
