Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can provide general information about common liver problems and potential treatment options. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Incorporate a balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugar, and salt. Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver problem (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage the condition.
   - In some cases, medications can help lower cholesterol levels or control diabetes, which in turn benefits liver health.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol:**
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for preventing further liver damage, especially in cases of alcoholic liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider are vital to monitor liver function and assess any progression of the disease.

Always seek medical guidance for tailored treatment based on your specific condition and health needs.
