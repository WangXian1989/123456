Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: If you have room in your budget after funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps reduce your taxable income and compound your savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, but remember they come with capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in these accounts.

6. **Investment Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure you diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice based on your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so these strategies should be customized to fit your personal financial goals.
