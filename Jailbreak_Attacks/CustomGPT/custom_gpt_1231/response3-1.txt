Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before investing heavily.

2. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **Focus on Growth:** Invest in diversified options, like index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement age.

3. **IRA:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** Decide based on your current tax situation:
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; withdrawals are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribute:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Diversify Investments:** Choose investments that are tax-efficient, such as municipal bonds or index funds.
   - **Flexibility:** Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or investments you may need to access sooner without penalties.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances and goals.

This balanced approach can help maximize your retirement savings while considering liquidity and tax implications.
