Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. This is ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, leading to tax-free growth and withdrawals. It’s beneficial if you expect higher income in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax, so consider this when investing here. Use this account for money you may need in the short term or for specific goals.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to manage risk and enhance growth potential.
   - Consider your time horizon: Long-term investments can be more aggressive, while funds needed in the short term should be more conservative.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Evaluate your allocations periodically (e.g., annually) to ensure they still align with your goals, especially as markets fluctuate.

### 5. **Consider Fees and Investment Options:**
   - Review the fees associated with each account. Some 401(k) plans have higher fees than others. Choose low-cost investment options when possible.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions to reach the employer match, then contribute to reach the annual limit if possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the annual limit.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any remaining funds after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances, particularly regarding tax strategies and investment choices. Regularly assess your financial goals and adjust your allocation accordingly.
