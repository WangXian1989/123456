Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how you can approach this:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to capture the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you’re in a higher tax bracket now but expect to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can begin investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility (e.g., no withdrawal penalties) but are subject to capital gains taxes. 

### 4. **General Guidelines:**
   - **Consider Your Time Horizon:** Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on income-generating investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review the asset allocation in each account to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your salary (to max out employer match)
- **IRA:** Max out traditional or Roth contributions annually ($6,500 for 2023)
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals.
