Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax deductions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **Choose the right accounts for the right investments**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts for better tax treatment.

### 2. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Balance your investment types**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **Rebalance regularly**: Keep your desired asset allocation by adjusting contributions and withdrawals based on market performance.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts first in retirement**: This can help you limit tax implications and allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow for a longer period.
   - **Consider required minimum distributions (RMDs)**: Be mindful of RMDs from your 401(k) and traditional IRA starting at age 72.

### 4. **Emergency Savings**
   - **Maintain liquidity**: Ensure you have enough savings in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs without tapping into retirement accounts.

Considering your specific circumstances, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
