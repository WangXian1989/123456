To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Check the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible now (Traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends, making them less favorable for long-term growth compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) outside of these accounts before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all three types of accounts to balance risk and optimize tax implications. Consider how asset location affects your overall tax strategy.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Monitor your investments periodically and adjust contributions based on performance, changes in income, and life circumstances.

7. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your long-term goals, whether it's retirement, buying a home, or funding education.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and considering your tax situation, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
