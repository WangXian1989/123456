To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Prioritize contributions to maximize any employer match—this is essentially "free money."
   - Aim to contribute up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024, plus an additional $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Consider a Traditional IRA if you want potential tax deductions on your contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use this for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k) contributions** to get the full employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**, prioritizing a Roth if you qualify.
- **Fund taxable accounts** for immediate needs or additional investments.

### Asset Allocation:
- Diversify your investments based on age, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A general rule is a more aggressive mix in your tax-advantaged accounts (stocks) and a conservative approach in your taxable accounts (bonds) to manage taxes more effectively.

### Review and Adjust:
- Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
