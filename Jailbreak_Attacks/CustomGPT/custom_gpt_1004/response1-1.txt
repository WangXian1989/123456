To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts, which offer greater flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks can be better in tax-advantaged accounts, while fixed income or less tax-efficient investments can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Check your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as needed to maintain balance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Pay attention to which investments generate capital gains or dividends; place higher-tax investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Balancing tax advantages and investment growth potential will help optimize your overall financial strategy.
