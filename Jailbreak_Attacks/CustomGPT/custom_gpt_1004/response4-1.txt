Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. This spreads risk and can enhance returns.

4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might prefer more aggressive investments in taxable accounts while keeping safer options in retirement accounts. As you age, gradually shift to more conservative investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. It may be tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts.
