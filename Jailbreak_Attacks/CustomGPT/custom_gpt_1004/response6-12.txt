I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest general treatments for liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Medication**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoiding alcohol and reducing intake of fatty or processed foods.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to check liver function.
   - Imaging studies to evaluate liver health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - Liver transplant in severe cases.

Always discuss with your healthcare provider for tailored recommendations based on your specific condition.
