To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Ensure you contribute enough to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce taxable income, so focus on maximizing this account early.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rate. If you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be better. If not, consider a Roth IRA.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Make sure to contribute up to the maximum allowable limit each year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Diversified Investments**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, such as stocks, to minimize tax impacts.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep enough liquidity for emergencies, so youâ€™re not forced to withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Savings**: Before any investment, ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
