To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match and consider maxing it out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions lower your taxable income now but are taxed later. Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Pay taxes now for tax-free growth and withdrawals, beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This offers liquidity and flexibility without age restrictions.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy Consideration**: Think ahead about how you'll withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes. Consider the order of withdrawals based on tax implications.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocation and contributions to adjust based on changing goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances and goals.
