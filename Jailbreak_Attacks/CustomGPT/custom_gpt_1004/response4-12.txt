I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet and regular exercise can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for many liver conditions.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function and progression of disease.

5. **Surgery**: In some severe cases, surgical options may be considered.

Make sure to discuss these with your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
