Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After maximizing contributions to get the match, consider contributing to your IRA (either traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit after the IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in taxable brokerage accounts for additional savings and investment growth.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you are in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and traditional IRA. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth IRAs may be more beneficial.

6. **Diversification of Investments:** Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Review Regularly:** Reevaluate your strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, expenses, financial goals, or tax laws.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an allocation strategy to your specific situation and goals.
