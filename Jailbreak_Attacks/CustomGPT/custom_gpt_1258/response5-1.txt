(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it's advisable to max out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Finally, any additional money can be allocated to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
