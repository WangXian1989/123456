When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize your investment potential:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation; Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth.

2. **Balance Risk and Liquidity:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more liquid investments and to diversify your portfolio. This is also where you can hold investments that may be taxed at more favorable long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Capital Gains and Dividends:** Choose tax-efficient investments for taxable accounts to minimize yearly tax liabilities.
   - **Asset Location:** Place high-growth, potentially high-tax assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds or low-growth assets in taxable accounts.

This strategic distribution can enhance your overall returns while managing tax obligations effectively.
