To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax advantages:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also offers potential tax deductions, depending on your income and filing status.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional investments. Keep in mind:
   - You have more flexibility with taxable accounts in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.
   - Be aware of capital gains taxes on investments when selling in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor the investments in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts since they can be more tax-efficient in that context.
   - Use more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on interest income.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that your investments align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy, consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

Implementing these strategies can help optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
