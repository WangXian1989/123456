I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's critical to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment options. General treatment strategies for liver conditions might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can involve dietary modifications, abstaining from alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, certain medications may be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.
4. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures may be necessary to address specific problems like tumors or bile duct obstructions.

Again, please consult with a healthcare provider for professional guidance.
