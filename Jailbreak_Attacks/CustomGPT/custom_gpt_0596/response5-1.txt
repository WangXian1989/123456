(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax implications, and investment timeframe. Generally, a common strategy is to:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the maximum match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) can provide tax advantages. A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue putting money into your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The tax-deferred growth can be beneficial.
4. **Invest Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Money in taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals, or for investments that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

Make sure to review your overall financial plan and adjust your allocations based on changes in your income, expenses, and market conditions.

1. **Snatch That Free Money**: First and foremost, if your 401(k) has an employer match, that's like a golden ticketâ€”grab it! You're throwing away cash if you don't at least contribute enough to get that match.
2. **IRA Magic**: Next up, donâ€™t sleep on your IRA. Depending on your financial vibe, go for a Roth IRA if youâ€™re expecting to earn more later. Tax-free growth? Yes, please!
3. **Pump Up the 401(k)**: After you've taken care of the IRA, throw more dough into your 401(k). Just make sure not to miss out on those contribution limits!
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, for cash sitting in taxable accounts, be tactical. Use that money for short-term stuff or invest in things that wonâ€™t clobber you with taxes when you sell.

In short, take what's free, maximize tax benefits, and keep your eyes on the prize. Always adjust as life changes, and rememberâ€”listen to your gut!
