Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Individual accounts offering tax advantages. Traditional IRAs have tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not have tax advantages, but offer flexibility and easier access to funds.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for growth since they allow you to delay taxes on earnings until withdrawal.
   - Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or interest, as they may be taxed at a lower rate depending on your situation.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals:**
   - If you're saving for retirement, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (up to the employer match in 401(k)).
   - For short-term goals (e.g., buying a house), a taxable account may be more appropriate due to its liquidity.

### 4. **Establish Contribution Priorities:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - **Return to 401(k):** If you still have room in your budget, return to the 401(k) to maximize contributions.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, especially for financial goals outside retirement.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and life stages.

### Conclusion:
Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy according to your unique situation, as they can provide insights tailored to your goals and circumstances.
