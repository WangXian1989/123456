Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing your retirement savings and minimizing taxes. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lead to significant growth over time.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for the tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA Benefits**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money needed before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-free municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Summary of Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially to gain employer match.
- **IRA**: Prioritize Roth contributions for long-term tax benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for flexibility and invest in tax-efficient vehicles.

This approach balances immediate tax benefits and future flexibility, aligning with your financial goals.
