Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Strategy:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and provides immediate returns.

### 2. **Prioritize Roth IRA Contributions (if eligible)**
   - **Strategy:** If your income allows, contribute to a Roth IRA. This account grows tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free.

### 3. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:**
     - **Strategy:** Consider maxing out your contributions to these accounts next. These are useful for reducing your taxable income now, but remember you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Strategy:** Use taxable accounts for any funds you expect to need before retirement or for short-term goals. They offer flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **High-Growth Investments:** Consider placing these in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
   - **Bonds/Interest-Generating Assets:** Place these in taxable accounts to benefit from potentially lower tax rates on capital gains.

### 6. **Rebalancing and Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified. Regularly rebalance your accounts to maintain your target asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider professional guidance tailored to your specific situation, especially if navigating tax implications.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to accounts with tax advantages while also ensuring liquidity through taxable accounts. Regularly assess your financial goals, and adjust contributions as needed.
