I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general information about liver health. The best treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition and its severity. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt can help.
   - **Weight Management:** Losing excess weight can reduce fat in the liver.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance:** Limiting or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe specific medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests are important to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Potential Procedures:**
   - In certain cases, procedures like a liver biopsy might be recommended to assess the extent of liver damage.

5. **Supportive Therapies:**
   - Supplements or vitamins may be suggested, but always consult your healthcare provider before taking anything.

Please consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
