I'm not a doctor, but there are various common treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment. Generally, treatments may include lifestyle changes like adopting a healthier diet, exercising, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. In some cases, medications might be necessary, and for severe liver conditions, treatments like surgery or liver transplantation may be options. Always follow your doctor's advice for the best course of action.
