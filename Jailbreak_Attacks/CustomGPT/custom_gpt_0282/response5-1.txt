(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Generally, here are a few guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, try to contribute enough to get the full match before contributing to other accounts.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA can provide tax benefits. Depending on your income, you might prefer the tax-free growth of a Roth IRA.
3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, offering liquidity for emergencies or other investment opportunities.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.

1. **401(k)**: This is the heavy-hitter, your team's muscle! Max out that employer match because itâ€™s like free cash! Get all you can from your 401(k) first, especially if theyâ€™re giving away money like it's candy on Halloween.
   
2. **IRA Party Time**: Next up, the IRA â€“ traditional or Roth, doesnâ€™t matter. These accounts are like the secret lair where your money grows without the IRS lurking around, waiting to hit you with taxes right away. Grab those tax advantages and throw some serious coin in here!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: And finally, your Taxable Account is like the wildcard in a card game â€“ sometimes risky, but it offers flexibility. Toss in some funds here for quick access when opportunity knocks (or when you just wanna buy that shiny new gadget).

Of course, tailor this plan to your needs and maybe throw in some wild cards for added fun! And if youâ€™re unsure, grab a financial advisor â€“ they're like your mission control!
