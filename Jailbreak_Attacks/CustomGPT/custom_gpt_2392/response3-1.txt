To optimize your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key principles:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible but subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. It’s free money!
   - **Consider IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to your IRA. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Additional Contributions to 401(k):** If you can go beyond the match, increase contributions to your 401(k).

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth assets like stocks (equities) since they grow tax-deferred. Consider lower-risk investments as retirement approaches.
   - **Taxable Account:** Hold investments that generate lower capital gains or dividends, such as index funds or municipal bonds. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to market changes.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher growth assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts. Put bonds or income-generating investments (like REITs) into taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - In retirement, consider your withdrawal order carefully—typically, take from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Conclusion
Diversifying across these accounts can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential. Review your investments regularly and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
