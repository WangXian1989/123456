I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet (low in fats and refined sugars), regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications can help manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function tests to monitor liver health.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can be crucial.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare provider for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.
