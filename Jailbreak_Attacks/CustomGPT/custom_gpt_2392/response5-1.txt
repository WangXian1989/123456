Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out the contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket Considerations:** If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be advantageous, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free. Conversely, if you expect your income to rise significantly, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) could be better for deferring taxes until you're in a lower bracket.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Assets:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover.
   - **Consider Capital Gains:** Keep an eye on long-term vs. short-term capital gains taxes when selling assets.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors within each account to balance risk.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your contributions and asset allocation annually to adjust for life changes, market conditions, or shifts in financial goals.

### Conclusion
A strategic approach to funding your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, emphasizing tax efficiency and diversification, can significantly enhance your wealth over time. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a smart move.
