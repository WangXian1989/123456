Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Your Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, contributes pre-tax (or post-tax if a Roth), grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Provides tax advantages depending on the type. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may lower your taxable income. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains tax on profits. Useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it's free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Rates**: Invest more in tax-advantaged accounts if you’re in a higher tax bracket now. Shift towards taxable accounts if you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Utilize taxable accounts for tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, focusing on a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and life stages. 

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize to employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the max allowable.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds, focusing on diversification.

### Conclusion
Every individual’s financial situation is unique, so it might be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution to your specific needs and goals.
