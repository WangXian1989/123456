Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Aim to contribute the maximum annual limit. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Check the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 for those under 50, $30,000 for those 50 and older).
   - **IRA**: The annual limit is typically $6,500 (or $7,500 if youâ€™re over 50).

### 3. **Diversify Within Accounts**
   - Allocate various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance across all accounts to maintain diversification.

### 4. **Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax. Utilize this account for investments you may want to hold for shorter periods or for more liquid needs.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Taxes are deferred or tax-free depending on the type. Be mindful of withdrawal penalties and tax implications upon distribution.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Long-term goals can lean towards growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts. Shorter-term goals may necessitate more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Assess your allocations regularly to ensure alignment with your goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Prioritizing tax-advantaged account contributions while maintaining a diversified portfolio tailored to your goals can optimize your financial strategy. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
