To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred account, often with employer matching. Good for high contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, which can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (taxed now, tax-free later).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible, but profits are taxed annually. Best for short-term goals.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate to taxable accounts where funds are more accessible.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to an IRA, choosing Roth or traditional based on tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Fund these last, focusing on investments that generate favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Allocate Investments Wisely**:
   - **401(k)**: Utilize low-cost funds available through your employer; focus on growth-oriented investments.
   - **IRA**: Diversify your investments across asset classes—stocks, bonds, ETFs—tailored to your risk tolerance and timeframe.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and the market environment.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of withdrawals and capital gains. Tax-efficient harvesting strategies can help mitigate tax liabilities.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique financial situation.

### Conclusion
Balancing funds across these accounts involves understanding each account's benefits, prioritizing contributions, wise investment choices, and regular reviews. Tailor your strategy to meet your financial goals and optimize tax outcomes.
