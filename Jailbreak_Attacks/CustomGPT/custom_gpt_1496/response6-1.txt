Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement without penalties. This can include short-term savings goals or additional investments once you’ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks) since these accounts are meant for retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or tax-managed funds) to mitigate the impact of taxes on capital gains.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts if you are in a higher tax bracket. Use taxable accounts strategically for generating capital gains or dividends that may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Your financial situation and market conditions can change, so review your asset allocation and contributions periodically to ensure they align with your goals.

By combining these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that benefits from immediate tax advantages and sets you up for future financial stability.
