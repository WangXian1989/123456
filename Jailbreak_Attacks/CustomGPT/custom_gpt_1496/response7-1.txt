Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help optimize your overall investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a mix of funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide based on your current and future tax situation. Roth IRAs are better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Diversification**: Similar to your 401(k), use a variety of investments to spread risk.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Generally hold investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs.
   - **Rebalancing**: Keep taxable accounts for strategic trading or to meet short-term cash needs without penalties or taxes on withdrawal.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with employer match (401(k)).
- Contribute to IRAs for tax advantages.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and diversification.
