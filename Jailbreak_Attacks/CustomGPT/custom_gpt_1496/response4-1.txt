Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and future plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit before funding other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on your contributions until you withdraw during retirement. This can be beneficial for reducing your current taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short- to medium-term goals. You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, so consider these accounts for investments you expect to sell before retirement.

3. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place your investments based on tax efficiency:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bond funds) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or ETFs) can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This can help protect your portfolio against volatility.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+ for 2023)
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+ for 2023)
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but consider your overall investment strategy.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Assess your distribution annually based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
