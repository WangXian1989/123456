Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches, focus on contributing up to that amount first. Consider the fees and investment choices available in your plan.
   - **IRA**: After the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are more flexible and allow for withdrawals without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when choosing how to allocate funds within these accounts. Generally, you might want to have a higher percentage of stocks in accounts where you'll let funds grow for a longer time (like IRAs) and consider more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Check your allocations yearly and adjust based on changes in your goals, timeline, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal situations vary greatly, so if you're feeling unsure, talking to a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

This structure can help balance growth potential with tax efficiency and accessibility.
