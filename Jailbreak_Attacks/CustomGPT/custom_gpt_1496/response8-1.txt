Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider the Tax Benefits of IRAs**: 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, making it suitable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals. Consider holding investments with lower capital gains or cash for liquidity.

4. **Investment Allocation**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments like stocks, as these grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Similar to other retirement accounts, prioritize growth since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds) less frequently, as you'll incur taxes on dividends and interest.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations across accounts at least annually based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, especially if you have complicated tax concerns or estate planning matters.

Make sure to keep your long-term goals in mind and adjust as necessary based on your financial situation.
