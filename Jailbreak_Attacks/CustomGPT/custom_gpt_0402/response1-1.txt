The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. Consider contributing to this account if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, you may get tax benefits now (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth). If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is generally for funds you may need before retirement. Investments held long-term benefit from lower capital gains rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough in an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: Align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance and timeline for needing the funds. Stocks typically have higher potential returns but come with more volatility.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor a strategy to your personal circumstances for the best long-term outcome.
