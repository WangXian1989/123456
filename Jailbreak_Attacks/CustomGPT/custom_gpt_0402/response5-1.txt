The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on individual factors such as your investment goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. Contributions to these accounts can reduce your taxable income, and earnings grow tax-deferred (traditional accounts) or tax-free (Roth accounts).

3. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:** Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes on earnings and dividends, so consider holding investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Age and Investment Horizon:** Younger investors might focus more on growth (stocks), while older ones may want to preserve capital (bonds). Adjust your asset allocation over time as you approach retirement.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your investment allocations and rebalance as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
