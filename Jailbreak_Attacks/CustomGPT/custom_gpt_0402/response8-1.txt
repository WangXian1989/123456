To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they provide tax benefits. Maximize your employer's match in your 401(k) if available.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're over 50) and $6,500 to your IRA ($7,500 if youâ€™re over 50).

3. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds that generate higher taxable distributions) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawals and Taxes**: Consider your future tax bracket when planning withdrawals. Traditional accounts (401(k) and IRA) will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts (if applicable) allow tax-free withdrawals.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This may involve allocating different asset classes in each account while considering the overall risk and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as market conditions change and as you approach retirement. This ensures that your investment strategy aligns with your long-term goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you feel uncertain about your investment strategy, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.

These strategies can help you optimize your investments and minimize taxes over the long term.
