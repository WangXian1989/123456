Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employment Benefits:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match (if offered). This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Great for tax-deferred growth. If you qualify, consider contributing to reduce taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize Roth contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for short-term goals or to invest funds that don’t fit into tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Adjust the asset allocation in each account based on your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy. Consider higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts.

It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
