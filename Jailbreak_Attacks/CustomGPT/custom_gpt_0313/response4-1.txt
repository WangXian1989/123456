To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for pre-tax contributions; consider high-growth assets since withdrawals will be taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax benefits; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds. As you age, gradually shift towards more conservative investments.
   - **IRA**: Use for long-term growth; mix of equities or index funds works well.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Manage for liquidity and consider holding low-turnover funds to minimize taxes on gains.

4. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations based on market changes and personal goals. Adjust as needed.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Implementing these strategies can help optimize your investments across different account types.
