To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and aim to maximize annual limits.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible for tax deductions, consider using this for additional tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, use a Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for opportunities to access funds without penalties and to utilize tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Align your investment strategy with your retirement timeline—more aggressive investments if you have many years until retirement.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Reassess and adjust your allocations periodically to remain aligned with your goals and market changes.

To tailor your approach, consider consulting with a financial advisor, especially for personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.
