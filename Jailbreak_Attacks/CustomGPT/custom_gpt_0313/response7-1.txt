Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; ideal for reducing taxable income. Employer matches are a plus.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions similar to 401(k)s; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and access to funds without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out 401(k) contributions, especially to get the full employer match.
   - Contribute to IRAs (both traditional and Roth) up to the limit after maximizing the 401(k).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diverse investment strategy across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for when and how you'll withdraw funds to minimize tax impacts in retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailored advice can optimize your strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Consider this general framework as a guide, but remember, individual circumstances vary widely.
