I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options commonly suggested for liver problems, which may vary depending on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Following a liver-friendly diet that is low in fats, sugars, and processed foods can help manage liver health.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve liver function and overall health.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups:**
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies are often necessary to monitor liver function and assess the severity of liver disease.

4. **Avoidance of Alcohol and Toxins:**
   - Elimination of alcohol and avoiding exposure to harmful substances can help prevent further liver damage.

5. **Liver Transplant:** 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary, particularly if the liver is failing.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to the specifics of your condition.
