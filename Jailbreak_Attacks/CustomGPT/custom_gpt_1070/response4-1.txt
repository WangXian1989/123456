Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA after your 401(k). A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to traditional accounts reduce your taxable income, whereas withdrawals in retirement are taxed. In contrast, Roth accounts require after-tax contributions but allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts can be advantageous for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account type, aim for a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and timeline. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or other liquid assets before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Also, consider your short-term financial goals that may necessitate keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation and goals can change, so review your asset allocation and distribution strategy regularly, at least annually or after major life events.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re uncertain about how to allocate your investments or need personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

The optimal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so it's important to assess your situation carefully.
