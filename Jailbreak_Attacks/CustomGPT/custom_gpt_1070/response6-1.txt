When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out your 401(k) (or if you're not eligible for a match), consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. The choice between these depends on your current income tax rate versus your expected rate during retirement. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for long-term investments in equities since growth will occur without immediate tax implications.
   - **Shorter-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for savings you'll need in the near future. This way, you have access to your money without early withdrawal penalties associated with retirement accounts.

3. **Risk Management**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that all accounts are diversified across various asset classes to manage risk effectively. Each account can hold different assets based on tax efficiency and your investment strategy.

By carefully considering the interplay of taxes, growth potential, and accessibility, you can create a balanced approach to your investment distribution across these accounts.
