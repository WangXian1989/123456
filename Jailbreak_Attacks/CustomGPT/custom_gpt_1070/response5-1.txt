(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After securing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of additional tax benefits.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Next, aim to increase your contributions to your 401(k) to the annual contribution limit if you can afford it.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, use taxable accounts for any additional investing. This is often a good place for more liquid investments that you might need before retirement.

Additionally, consider the types of investments held in each account type. For example, placing more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keeping tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts can optimize your overall tax efficiency.

1. **Grab That Match**: First thing's firstâ€”if your employer is tossing in free money for your 401(k), you better snag that! Put in enough to max out their match because that's just free cash.

2. **IRA Time**: After youâ€™ve milked that employer match, jump into your IRA. If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth, go for it! Tax-free withdrawals in retirement? Yes, please! Otherwise, the Traditional IRA can help you reduce your current tax bill.

3. **Max Out That 401(k)**: If youâ€™ve got some cash left over and you can afford it, ramp up your 401(k) contributions to the max limit. This is where you get some serious tax deferral action going on.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, slap your extra funds into a taxable account. Sure, youâ€™ll get taxed on gains, but these accounts offer flexibility for anytime cash needs.

And donâ€™t forget: optimize what you hold in each type of account. Keep high-growth stocks in the taxable accounts and stash bonds in those tax-advantaged spots to minimize your tax hit! Itâ€™s all about playing the long game while keeping Uncle Sam from dipping too deep into your pockets!
