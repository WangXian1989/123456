Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you decide the best way to allocate your investments:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or other financial milestones?

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money." Depending on your income, you can contribute a significant amount annually (up to $20,500 in 2022, with a catch-up contribution for those over 50).
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth). The limit for 2022 is $6,000 (or $7,000 if you're 50 or older). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deferral.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs) lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - Roth accounts require after-tax contributions but allow for tax-free withdrawals, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified. This may involve various asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate. Risk tolerance and time horizon will guide your asset allocation.

5. **Reassess Periodically**: Review your portfolio allocation regularly. Life changes, market conditions, and changes in financial goals may necessitate adjustments to your mix.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation, particularly if you have significant assets or complex tax considerations.

Ultimately, the best approach combines strategic contributions to both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts in alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
