Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline on how to approach this distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can afford to, especially if you can get the employer match. Traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out an IRA next. Traditional IRAs may give you tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth contributions (Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) may be beneficial, allowing tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If you are in your peak earning years and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) may be more advantageous.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After optimizing your contributions to retirement accounts, you can invest excess funds in taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and can be accessed without penalties, but you'll have to pay capital gains tax on any profits.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within each type of account, ensure you're diversifying your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: It’s often wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice that accounts for your specific circumstances, especially concerning tax strategies.

By utilizing these approaches, you can create a balanced strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
