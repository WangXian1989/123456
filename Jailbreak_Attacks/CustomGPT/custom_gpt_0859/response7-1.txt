The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Maxing out contributions can be beneficial for high-income earners, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - Assess the investment options in your 401(k) for fees and performance.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Accounts)**: 
   - Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions for contributions, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Consider maxing out IRA contributions after you have met your employerâ€™s match in a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility with withdrawals. This can be used for short- to medium-term goals, like buying a home or funding a child's education.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of capital gains when investing in taxable accounts. Consider holding investments long enough to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with employer match in 401(k).
- Max out Roth or Traditional IRA contributions based on your tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for shorter-term financial goals or when you have exhausted tax-advantaged accounts.
- Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies that align with your financial objectives.
