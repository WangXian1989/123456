The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Aim to contribute at least enough to maximize the match before allocating funds elsewhere.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match. The choice between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA depends on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Tax-efficient Funds**: If you have to use taxable accounts, prefer index funds or ETFs that minimize taxable events.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, keeping in mind the risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
   - You may want to place more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (where gains are tax-deferred or tax-free) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This can involve moving money between accounts to keep your investment strategy aligned.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - How long do you have until retirement? Generally, the longer the time horizon, the more risk you can afford to take, which will influence your distribution strategy.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts. This should ideally cover 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy depends on your unique circumstances, so consider starting with these guidelines and adjusting based on your specific needs.
