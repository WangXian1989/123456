When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account various factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). 

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Considerations**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you are young and have a long time until retirement, you might prioritize growth-focused investments in your tax-advantaged accounts. In contrast, if you are closer to retirement, focusing on more stable, income-generating investments may be advisable.

4. **Emergency Fund and Debt Management**:
   - Before heavily investing in any account, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) and that you are managing any high-interest debt.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk effectively. This can be done in any of the account types.

6. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investments in taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when trading, and consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and reassess your investment allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your unique situation and to ensure compliance with all regulations regarding account contributions and distributions.
