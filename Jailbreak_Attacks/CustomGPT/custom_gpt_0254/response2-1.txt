Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!).
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Brackets**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals.
   - In higher brackets, traditional accounts may provide immediate tax breaks.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Allocate savings for short-term goals or emergency funds here.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 20% to max out employer match.
- **IRA:** 10% annually until maxed out.
- **Taxable:** 70% for short-term needs and additional investments.

### Conclusion
Tailor these guidelines to your personal financial situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
