Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** After maximizing employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 3. **Further Contributions:**
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after funding your IRA.
   - Assess if you prefer the immediate tax benefit of a traditional 401(k) or the long-term tax-free growth of a Roth 401(k).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you’ve maximized the above options.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure alignment with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### **Example Allocation:**
- **401(k):** 15% of income
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged contributions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
