Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is typically free money and a great start for retirement savings.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts grow tax-deferred, which can significantly enhance your retirement savings.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Additionally, tax-loss harvesting can help offset gains.

### 4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you'll need soon (within 5 years).
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) for risk management. Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

### Summary
- **Max Out 401(k) for employer match ➡️ Contribute to IRA ➡️ Invest in taxable accounts.**
- **Focus on tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts.**

Evaluate your specific situation regularly to adjust contributions as needed based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
