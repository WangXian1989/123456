Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any matching contributions from your employer; this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as it provides tax advantages.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA offers tax deductions; Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility and no contribution limits.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a good mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - Taxable accounts can provide easier access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust contributions as income changes or life circumstances evolve.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 5%-15% of income (enough to max the match)
- **IRA**: Max contributions annually (e.g., $6,000 - $7,000 depending on age)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder after maxing out the above accounts.

### Conclusion
Always tailor your strategy to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights.
