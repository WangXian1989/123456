Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Great for reducing taxable income now.
   - **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA)**: Beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in retirement.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a taxable account before aggressive investing.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) and sectors in each account to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 20-30%
- **IRA**: 20-30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40-60%

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
