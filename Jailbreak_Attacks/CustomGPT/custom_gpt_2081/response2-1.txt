Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - If possible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Consider a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**:
   - If you still have room in your budget after maxing out your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, suitable for your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider tax implications when withdrawing funds in retirement; some accounts are taxed differently.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Review your allocations annually to adjust based on performance and life changes.
