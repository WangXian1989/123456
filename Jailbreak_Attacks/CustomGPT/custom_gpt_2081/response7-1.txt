Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. 
   - A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **401(k) Contributions**
   - If you can afford to, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as these may be taxed at a lower rate. This can also be a place for more liquid investments.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments by allocating a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Consider the tax implications of withdrawing funds in retirement. Funds in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If possible, consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

Each person's situation is unique, so adjusting these general guidelines based on your specific needs is essential. Consider factors like your current age, retirement goals, and expected income during retirement.
