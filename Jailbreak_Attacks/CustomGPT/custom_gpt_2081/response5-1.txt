When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to think about your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum permitted, especially if you can benefit from pre-tax contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing any additional funds in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon, distributing your investments appropriately across these accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired allocation over time.

7. **Consider Taxes**: Be aware of the tax implications of your investment returns, particularly in taxable accounts, where capital gains taxes can impact your overall returns.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
