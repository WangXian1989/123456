Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Based on Tax Situation**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you expect a lower rate, a Traditional IRA may be better for tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and income restrictions for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are useful for investing outside of retirement accounts and can provide flexibility for withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and goals.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary, and consulting with a financial advisor can tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your accounts.
