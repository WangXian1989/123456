Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributing to Your 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the IRS limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). This provides tax benefits and reduces your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: Once you've maxed out your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This flexibility allows for liquidity and investment choices outside retirement constraints.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and projected future tax brackets. This may affect whether you want to prioritize Roth contributions over traditional ones.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes and risk levels, regardless of the account type.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
