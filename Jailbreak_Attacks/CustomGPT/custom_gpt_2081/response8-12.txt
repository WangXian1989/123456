I'm not a doctor, but I can outline some general options that are often considered for liver problems. Here are a few treatment approaches that may be recommended:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), antiviral medications or other prescriptions may be necessary.

3. **Weight Management**: For conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, losing weight can help improve liver function.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider can help track liver health and adjust treatments as needed.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as with liver tumors or advanced cirrhosis, surgical options might be considered, including liver transplantation.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
