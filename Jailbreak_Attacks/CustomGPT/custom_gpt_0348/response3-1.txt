Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed, but you have flexibility when you withdraw.

### 3. **Diversify Contributions**
   - Start by maxing out your 401(k) match, then contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible.
   - Once you reach the IRA limit, funnel excess savings into your 401(k) or taxable accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Savings**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **First**: Max out 401(k) to employer match.
- **Second**: Contribute to Roth IRA (up to limit).
- **Third**: Increase contributions to 401(k).
- **Last**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Conclusion
This strategy provides a balance between tax advantages and flexibility. It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the plan to your individual circumstances.
