To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. Employers may match contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages on contributions, but you can access funds anytime. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**
   - After maximizing the match, prioritize funding a Traditional IRA if your income allows for full contributions.

### 4. **Consider Roth Contributions**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA. This is beneficial for younger individuals expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Supplement with Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments that you may want to access before retirement without penalties.

### 6. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts to delay taxes on capital gains.

### 7. **Review Annually**
   - Reassess your investments and contributions each year based on performance, changes in income, and tax laws.

### Example Distribution Plan
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough for full employer match.
2. **IRA:** Max out Roth or Traditional IRA contributions.
3. **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional funds here, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
Tailor your approach based on your financial goals, age, and tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
