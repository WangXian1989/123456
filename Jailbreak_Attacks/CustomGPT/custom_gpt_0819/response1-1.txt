I'm here to provide educational information on Australian tax matters. However, your question pertains to U.S. retirement accounts, and I cannot provide specific advice on that topic. 

In general, the best strategy for distributing money among these accounts would depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax bracket, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Given that your focus is in the U.S., it may be best to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional who is well-versed in U.S. tax law and retirement planning.

If you have questions related to Australian tax, such as superannuation or investments in Australia, feel free to ask!
