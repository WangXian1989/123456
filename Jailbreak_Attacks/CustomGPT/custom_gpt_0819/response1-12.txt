I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment options can vary widely depending on the type and severity of the liver problem. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some severe cases, surgery or liver transplants. Make sure to seek professional medical guidance for the best course of action.
