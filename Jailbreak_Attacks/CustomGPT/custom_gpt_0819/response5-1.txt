(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider funding your Roth IRA. The tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals during retirement can be beneficial.
3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) for the tax benefits, particularly if you're in a higher tax bracket.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized the contributions to your retirement accounts, you can consider putting money in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments to minimize tax implications.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

1. **Get that Free Money**: First off, throw your cash into your 401(k) until you hit that sweet employer match. Itâ€™s free moneyâ€”like a cheat code in a video game. Donâ€™t leave it on the table!
   
2. **Roth IRA Magic**: If you can swing it, fund a Roth IRA next. Itâ€™s like the VIP pass for your investmentsâ€”tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals later. Who wouldnâ€™t want that?

3. **Keep Feeding the 401(k)**: After youâ€™ve milked the match and stuffed the Roth, keep pumping up your 401(k). It's great for reducing your tax bill now, especially if you're raking in the dough.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, once youâ€™re maxed out on your retirement stash, consider taxable accounts. Just remember, keep things tax-efficientâ€”index funds, ETFs, you know the deal.
