I'm here to assist you with Australian tax-related questions. However, the concept of 401(k) and IRA accounts pertains primarily to the United States. If you're looking for advice on how to allocate funds in these types of accounts, I would recommend consulting a financial advisor who specializes in U.S. retirement accounts. They can provide personalized guidance based on your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement plans.

If you have similar questions regarding retirement savings or investments within the context of Australian tax law or accounts like superannuation, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide information relevant to those topics!
