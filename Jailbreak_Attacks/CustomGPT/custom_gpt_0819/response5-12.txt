I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest you consider discussing treatment options with your healthcare provider. They can evaluate your specific liver condition and recommend the best course of action, which may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures depending on the nature and severity of the problem.

In general, for liver problems, options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can involve dietary modifications, increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol and certain medications that could exacerbate liver issues.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease, specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address the underlying condition.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Your doctor may recommend regular check-ups to monitor liver function and make adjustments to the treatment plan as needed.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to address issues like tumors or blockages.

Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for personalized advice. Your health is important, and professional guidance is crucial.

If you're facing any serious liver issues, please seek immediate medical attention.
