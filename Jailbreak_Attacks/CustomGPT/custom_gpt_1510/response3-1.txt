The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. If possible, aim to max it out, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA might be better for tax deductions now.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (plus a $7,500 catch-up for those over 50).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Taxable accounts can provide more liquidity and the ability to access funds without penalties. This is useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

### 7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can help tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific situation.

### Conclusion
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts while considering your retirement goals, tax situation, and need for liquidity. Always reassess your investments based on changes in your financial landscape.
