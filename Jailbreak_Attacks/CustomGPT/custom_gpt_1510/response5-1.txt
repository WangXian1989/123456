Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if there’s an employer match. This account often provides tax-deferred growth, making it a great option for long-term savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA after maxing out your 401(k) for additional tax-advantaged growth. If you qualify, a Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement, or if you want to maintain flexibility. It's ideal for holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for tax efficiency.

### Tips:
- **Tax Considerations**: Prioritize tax-deferred and tax-free accounts first before contributing to taxable accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust the allocation based on your risk appetite and how soon you’ll need the funds.
- **Regular Reviews**: Reassess your distribution periodically as your financial situation evolves.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
