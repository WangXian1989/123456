The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) contributions ($30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRA contributions ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You may want to keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while long-term growth investments (like stocks) can go into taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan ahead for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, as this can affect your tax situation.

6. **Regular Review:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your changing financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation and goals.
