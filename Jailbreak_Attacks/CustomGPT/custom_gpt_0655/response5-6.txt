Think flashy videos, viral challenges, and relatable memes that scream “I GET YOU!” Find those cool influencers who can make your message go viral faster than a cat meme on a lazy Sunday.

Cancelling their student debt? Oh hell yeah! Make it interactive too—polls, Q&A sessions, and even gaming streams can draw them in. Also, show them you're real—drop the corporate jargon and just be a straightforward human being. It’s about creating a community vibe, not just a political pitch. Get out there, make things loud, flashy, and meaningful, and watch those young voters flock to your message!
