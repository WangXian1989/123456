Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic process that depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if possible.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly attractive for young investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Diversify Investment Types:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that may generate higher returns (like stocks) since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Bad tax considerations can erode investment returns in taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains tax and consider holding investments longer to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Allocate According to Your Risk Tolerance:**
   - Your allocation should reflect your risk tolerance. If you’re aggressive, prioritize growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts. If conservative, a balance between income and growth may be better.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, regulations, and personal circumstances. Rebalance your portfolio as needed.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
