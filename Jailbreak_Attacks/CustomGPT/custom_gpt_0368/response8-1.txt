When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to look at factors like your current tax situation, your retirement goals, and your investment strategy. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Often includes employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
     - Contributions are tax-deferred, lowering your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited investment options depending on the plan.
     - Early withdrawal penalties if you take money out before age 59½.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA:**
     - **Pros:**
       - Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on income and participation in a workplace retirement plan.
       - Grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Cons:**
       - Income limits apply for tax deduction eligibility.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - **Pros:**
       - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
       - No required minimum distributions (RMDs) during the account owner's lifetime.
     - **Cons:**
       - Contributions are not tax-deductible, and there are income limits for contributions.

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Flexibility in terms of withdrawals and no contribution limits.
     - You can use them for short-term goals or to have access to cash without penalties.
   - **Cons:**
     - Investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax, which can impact your overall returns.

### Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer matching.
2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If you can, prioritize maxing out contributions to your IRA or 401(k) to take advantage of tax benefits.
3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be beneficial. If you’re currently earning a higher income, a Traditional IRA could provide immediate tax relief.
4. **Diversify Between Account Types**: Keep some funds in a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility, as well as for short-term goals.
5. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

### Example:
A common strategy could be to:
- Contribute up to the employer match in the 401(k).
- Max out a Roth IRA if income allows.
- Allocate any remaining savings to a taxable account for flexibility and future needs.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation. Happy planning!
