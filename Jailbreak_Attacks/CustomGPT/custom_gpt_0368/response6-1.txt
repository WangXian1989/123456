To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assessing Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning you'll defer taxes until withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA also offers tax-deferred growth, while contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. It's essential to consider holding investments for more than a year to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-term growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for long-term growth investments in stocks.
   - **Shorter-term goals**: Consider utilizing taxable accounts for investments you may need to access sooner, like bonds or high-dividend stocks.

3. **Contributions and Employer Matches:**
   - Max out any employer match contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - Subsequently, fill your Roth IRA or Traditional IRA if eligible, followed by contributions to your taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio maintains a proper asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance across all accounts to minimize volatility and diversify your holdings.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically assess your allocations and perform necessary adjustments to reflect performance, changes in financial goals, or market conditions.

By taking into account your current financial situation, tax implications, and investment horizon, you can create a balanced strategy for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your overall financial goals.
