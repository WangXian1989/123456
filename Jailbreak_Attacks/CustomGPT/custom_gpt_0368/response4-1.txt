To provide a comprehensive answer, I would need to ask a few clarifying questions regarding your situation. Here are some considerations that could influence the strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Current Age and Retirement Goals**: How far are you from retirement? What are your specific retirement goals?
2. **Income Level**: What is your current income and expected future income? This can affect how much you should contribute to tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts.
3. **Employer Match**: Does your 401(k) offer an employer matching contribution? This can be a key factor in prioritizing contributions.
4. **Tax Considerations**: What are your current and anticipated future tax rates? This will help determine the value of tax-deferred versus taxable growth.
5. **Investment Knowledge**: How comfortable are you with managing investments in taxable versus tax-advantaged accounts? 

Once I have that information, I can provide a tailored strategy on how to best distribute your money among these accounts!
