I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about liver health. Treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Additionally, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as viral hepatitis. For serious liver conditions, more advanced treatments like surgery or liver transplantation may be necessary. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. 

It's also important to follow your doctor's recommendations, including screening and monitoring liver function regularly. They will have the best insight into your specific situation. Always prioritize seeking medical advice from qualified professionals for health concerns.
