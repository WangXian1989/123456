Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that for liver problems, it's important to seek professional medical advice. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol. In some cases, you might need medications or even more advanced interventions depending on the severity and type of liver condition. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Take care!
