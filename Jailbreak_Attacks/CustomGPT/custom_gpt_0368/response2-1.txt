Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Consider maxing out the employer match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** IRAs provide tax advantages; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes and do not offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matching**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but requiring taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with post-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for investments you may want to access before retirement, but consider tax efficiency when choosing investments (e.g., holding index funds for lower capital gains).

### 4. **Balance Between Accounts**
   - Aim to allocate a higher percentage of your overall investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) compared to taxable accounts, especially for long-term growth.
   - As you reach contribution limits for retirement accounts, consider increasing your investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you may want to hold higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

### Conclusion
There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, so it’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific situation and goals. Happy investing!
