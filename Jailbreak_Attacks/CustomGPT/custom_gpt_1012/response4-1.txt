Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit before allocating to other accounts.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are tax-deferred (or Roth options available), which can reduce your taxable income if pre-tax.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Either Traditional or Roth**: Consider your current tax rate versus expected retirement tax rate. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for younger investors or those expecting higher future income.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay mindful of the annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are useful for short-term goals or if you may need access to funds before retirement age.
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Consider tax implications on capital gains and dividend income. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable distributions.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with the 401(k) to get the match.
- Contribute to an IRA next, especially if you want tax-advantaged growth.
- Use taxable accounts for any additional savings once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out or if you need liquidity.

Consult with a financial advisor for tailoring this strategy to your unique circumstances.
