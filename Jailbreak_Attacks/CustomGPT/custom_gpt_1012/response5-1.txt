(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your age, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA (additional catch-up contributions may apply if you're over 50).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, traditional accounts may be better for deferring taxes. If you expect your tax rate to be lower, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for future tax-free growth.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure a well-diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance. This may include stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts are useful for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties. You may allocate any excess funds here once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your unique circumstances.
