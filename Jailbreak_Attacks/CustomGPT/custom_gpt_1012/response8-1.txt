Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. You can also benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your tax situation and income level.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA might be more beneficial to lower your taxable income. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, a Roth account could be advantageous.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate your investment across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. Consider keeping more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities more effectively.

4. **Manage Withdrawals Strategically**:
   - Plan which accounts to withdraw from in retirement. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free, offering more flexibility.

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review your portfolios in all accounts annually and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Fees**:
   - Be aware of the fees associated with your 401(k) plan. If fees are high, it might make sense to prioritize contributions to your IRA or taxable accounts instead.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts for short-term needs.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and to create a tailored plan that meets your long-term financial goals.
