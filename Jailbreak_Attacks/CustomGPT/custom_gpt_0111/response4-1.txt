To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments to balance risk and return. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **traditional IRA** contributions are tax-deferred, while **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth.
   - Allocate taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for efficient withdrawals in retirement. Generally, drawing from taxable accounts first may allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By balancing contributions across these accounts while considering tax implications and growth potential, you can build a well-rounded investment strategy.
