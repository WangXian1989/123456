To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Balance growth and income across accounts. Use more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free.
   - Consider holding bonds or less aggressive assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications on gains.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce lower taxable income (like municipal bonds).

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Annually review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

By focusing on these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
