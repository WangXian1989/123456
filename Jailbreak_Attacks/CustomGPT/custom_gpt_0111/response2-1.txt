The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match if available. After that, consider maxing it out if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to your Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for additional savings and investments once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Consider holding investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds, and tax-efficient funds.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments**: Reserve higher-risk investments for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Income Investments**: Favor conservative, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impact.

### 4. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Review your allocation annually or when major life changes occur to adjust for changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

### 5. **Consultation**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances.

This approach helps balance growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity.
