I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Avoid alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

3. **Surgery**:
   - Liver transplant for severe liver failure.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

It's best to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan.
