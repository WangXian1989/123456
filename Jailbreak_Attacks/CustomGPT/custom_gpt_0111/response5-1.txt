Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, which provides tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for extra savings. These funds can be accessed without penalties and can offer tax-efficient investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance. Typically, stocks are better suited for long-term growth and can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts due to tax treatment.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to align with changing goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

Always consider your individual financial needs and circumstances in any strategy you choose.
