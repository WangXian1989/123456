Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) to reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates, such as stocks or index funds.

5. **Consider Investments**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like equities) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
