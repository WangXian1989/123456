Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. Itâ€™s free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Use this for higher contributions if your employer offers a match and lower fees.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as you pay taxes up front.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher taxes, like stocks. They're also flexible for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Balance Risk and Accessibility**: Keep a mix of investments. For long-term growth, lean towards equities; for stability, consider bonds.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance. 

6. **Regular Review**: Adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

Consulting a financial advisor can help personalize this strategy to your specific circumstances.
