To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, depending on your income level.
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing employer matching, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, as contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use any remaining funds for taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and liquidity, allowing you to access funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts. Diversify by including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalancing and Growth**: Regularly review and adjust allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals. Over time, the value of different investments will change, and rebalancing helps maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your specific goals and tax situation, consulting with a financial advisor is recommended.

By following these steps, you create a balanced approach to managing your retirement and investment accounts, optimizing growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
