To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Identify your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for each account.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match and consider increasing contributions toward the annual limit if it fits your budget.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
4. **Allocate Remaining Funds**: If you still have funds to invest after maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating those to a taxable investment account. This gives you flexibility for short-term goals and liquidity.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio of assets, including stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

This approach balances tax advantages, employer contributions, and liquidity while aligning with your long-term financial objectives. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
