To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred. Focus on maximizing contributions to these accounts, especially if you have employer matching in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Utilize this account for investments that may generate higher taxable income.

2. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from long-term growth without immediate tax burdens.
   - **Stable Investments**: Consider placing more stable, income-generating assets in taxable accounts, as these can be taxed more favorably over time.

3. **Contribution Limits and Roth Considerations**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Ensure you are contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - **Roth Option**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocation to maintain your desired risk level. Adjust based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

By aligning your investment strategies with tax implications and personal financial goals, you can optimize the effectiveness of your distributions among these accounts.
