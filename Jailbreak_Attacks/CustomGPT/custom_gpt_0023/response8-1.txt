Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k), with potential tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer more flexibility.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After employer match, prioritize contributions to IRAs (especially Roth, if eligible) for tax-free growth.

4. **Balance Contribution Levels**:
   - Continue to max out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts before adding more to taxable investments.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think about your retirement withdrawal strategy. You may want to have some funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.

6. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**:
   - Annually reassess your contributions based on changing financial circumstances and market conditions.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
