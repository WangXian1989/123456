To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions may lower current taxable income; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax advantages similar to 401(k) (pre-tax contributions), while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax upon sale; dividends and interest are taxed as ordinary income.

2. **Determine Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Check current annual limits.
   - **IRA**: Follow annual limits for traditional and Roth IRAs.

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

4. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before putting excess funds into taxable accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth with a suitable asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds).
   - **IRA**: Use tax-advantaged options for investments with high growth potential.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holdings that generate qualified dividends or long-term gains for tax efficiency.

6. **Adjust for Your Goals**:
   - Consider your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance when distributing your funds.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your allocations and adjust based on performance and changing financial situations.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max out employer match + fixed percentage.
2. **IRA**: Max out yearly contribution (prioritize Roth if eligible).
3. **Taxable**: After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in diversified assets.

### Consider Professional Advice:
- Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your situation.

Following these steps will help optimize your investment strategy and tax efficiency.
