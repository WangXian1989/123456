To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### Step-by-Step Strategy

1. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k), with traditional IRAs. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Max out employer matches in your 401(k) first.
   - Contribute to an IRA next, focusing on maxing out Roth or traditional based on your tax situation.
   - Invest additional funds in the 401(k) after maximizing IRAs.

3. **Optimal Asset Allocation**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, and retirement horizon.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailored guidance can help optimize your specific situation.

### Summary

- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, focus on tax-deferral.
- **IRA**: Use for long-term growth, consider Roth benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest tax-efficiently, focus on long-term capital gains.
