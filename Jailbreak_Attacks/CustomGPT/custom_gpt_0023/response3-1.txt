Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts (Traditional or Roth). Tax benefits vary based on the type.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds are taxed as you earn them, but they offer more flexibility.

2. **Contribute to 401(k) First**:
   - Maximize employer match if available (e.g., contribute enough to get the full match).
   - Prioritize this for tax advantages.

3. **Fund Your IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for additional tax-advantaged growth.
   - For 2024, contributions up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+) can be made.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Taxable accounts are suitable for short-term goals (less than 5 years) or if you want more liquidity.
   - Consider capital gains implications when choosing which investments to hold in taxable accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts based on risk tolerance.
   - Consider placing bonds or dividends in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

6. **Regularly Review**:
   - Reassess your contributions and investment allocations regularly, especially as your financial situation evolves.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider discussing with a financial professional.

### General Distribution Recommendations
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of retirement savings
- **IRA**: 20-30% of retirement savings
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-30% of total investments

### Next Steps

- **Educate**: Stay informed about changes in tax laws that could impact your strategy.
