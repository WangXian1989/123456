I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids, or drugs to ease symptoms may be prescribed.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Important for managing liver health, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be necessary.
5. **Nutritional Support**: Diet changes guided by a healthcare provider, such as reducing fat and sugar.
