To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available).

2. **Tax Benefits**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts:
     - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions lower your taxable income now.
     - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals:
     - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
