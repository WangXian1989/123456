Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning based on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, may include matching contributions, tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, tax advantages, contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or qualified for tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Fidelity to be taxed on gains, greater flexibility, no contribution limits.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Goals**
   - Retirement age and desired income.
   - Short- vs. long-term financial goals (buying a house, education).

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as this is "free money."

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a liquid account before investing heavily.

### 5. **Tax-Efficiency**
   - **Hold tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds)** in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - **Keep tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds)** in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

### 6. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**
   - If you expect lower taxes in retirement, consider a traditional 401(k) or IRA.
   - If you expect higher taxes, prioritize Roth accounts.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your portfolio allocation based on performance and life changes to maintain your risk tolerance.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances for nuanced decisions.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: max out to employer match.
- **IRA**: max contributions.
- **Taxable**: invest leftover funds focusing on tax-efficient products.

### Next Steps
- Review your investment choices within each account.
- Reassess your risk tolerance regularly.
