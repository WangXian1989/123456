Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) next. Whether you choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) depends on your current tax situation and future expectations. Roth IRAs can be particularly attractive if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts** can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investing but may be subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments held in each account:
   - Place higher-growth or more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep more stable investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside of these retirement accounts to cover emergencies or short-term needs. This prevents the need to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely, which can incur penalties and taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investment strategy and account allocations based on changes in your income, financial goals, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific situation and goals.
