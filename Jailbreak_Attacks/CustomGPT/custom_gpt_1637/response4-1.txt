Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great starting point for retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and an IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your savings over time:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit and benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA can provide either tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility, as you can withdraw money without penalties at any time (though you will pay taxes on any capital gains).

4. **Consider Investment Time Horizon**: If you need access to some funds before retirement, allocate more to your taxable accounts. For long-term growth, prioritize retirement accounts where your investments can grow undisturbed by taxation.

5. **Diversification of Assets**: Make sure your portfolio is diversified across all accounts. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, adjusted based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax-Efficiency**: Be mindful of where you hold your investments:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bond funds or REITs) may be better in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or stocks) can be held in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Rebalancing your portfolio can help maintain your desired risk level.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your funds across these different types of accounts, you can effectively manage your tax burden and optimize your savings for the future.
