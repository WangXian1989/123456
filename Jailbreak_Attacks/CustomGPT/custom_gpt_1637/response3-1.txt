The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine what you're saving for: retirement, a house, education, or other objectives. This will influence how you allocate your funds.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be a great long-term investment due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, keep a diverse portfolio across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts have different tax treatment on capital gains and dividends.
  
5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before investing heavily in retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account or similar.

6. **Evaluate Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals like retirement (20+ years), more aggressive investments may be appropriate. For shorter-term goals, consider more conservative investments.

7. **Continuous Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and approaching financial goals.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.

By carefully assessing your financial landscape and utilizing tax-advantaged accounts strategically, you can develop an effective distribution strategy.
