Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic decision that depends on various factors such as your age, income, retirement goals, and current tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider for effective distribution:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, contributions may be tax-deferred and sometimes matched by the employer. Best for those looking to reduce taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts come in two main typesâ€”Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. They offer flexibility but come with less tax efficiency.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be during retirement, you might prioritize funding a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k).
   - Maximize employer match contributions in your 401(k) before contributing to any other account.

3. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRA annually to take advantage of tax benefits and compounding growth.
   - For 2023, the contribution limits are as follows: 
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments to mitigate risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to market changes.

6. **Consider Future Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for your withdrawal strategy in retirement, considering tax implications. For example, you may want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

In summary, a balanced approach might involve:
- Maxing out employer contributions to your 401(k),
- Fully funding a Roth or Traditional IRA as per your tax strategy,
- Utilizing taxable accounts for additional investments when you hit contribution limits or need liquidity.

Always adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide tailored advice for your specific situation.
