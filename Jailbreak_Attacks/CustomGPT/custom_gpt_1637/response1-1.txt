Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Once you’re maxing out your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; you pay taxes now but enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages like retirement accounts but allow for more flexibility, such as accessing funds without penalties or waiting for retirement age.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Each account type can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments; however, consider placing investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more aggressive growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, due to the favorable long-term capital gains tax treatment.

4. **Emergency Funds**: 
   - Ensure you have sufficient emergency savings outside of these accounts before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: 
   - Consider your long-term objectives. If retirement is a while away, you might focus more on growth investments. If you’re nearing retirement, shift more towards preservation of capital.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Regularly review your investments and reallocate as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.
