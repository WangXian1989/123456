Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially “free money.”

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Next, consider contributing to your IRA, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deferred (traditional accounts), which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains tax, so consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) here.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance across all accounts. This may include stocks, bonds, and other investments.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your strategy annually or after major life changes to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: If uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

By following these steps, you can create a well-structured investment strategy that balances growth and tax efficiency.
