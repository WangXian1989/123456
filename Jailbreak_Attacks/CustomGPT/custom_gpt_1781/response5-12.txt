I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying issues.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progress of your condition.
4. **Supplements**: Some people may benefit from certain vitamins or supplements, but consult with a healthcare provider first.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options like a liver transplant may be considered.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
