When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account factors like tax advantages, investment options, and your financial goals. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Allocate extra funds to a taxable account for more flexibility and easier access to money.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; investments here should be more tax-efficient.
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Understand the implications of withdrawals and required minimum distributions (RMDs) in the future.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize employer match (e.g., up to 6% of income).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (e.g., currently $6,500 for individuals under 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use funds remaining after tax-advantaged accounts for investments with lower turnover costs.

This approach provides a balance that leverages the tax benefits of retirement accounts while maintaining liquidity with taxable accounts.
