It's important to keep in mind that financial advice should be personalized based on individual circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. However, here are some general principles that might help in deciding how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide tax benefits, such as tax deferral or tax-free growth, depending on whether they are traditional or Roth accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. For example, as of 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older) and for IRAs it is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

4. **Investment Choices**: Consider the investment options available in each account. 401(k) plans may have limited investment choices, while IRAs often have a broader range of options. Depending on your investment strategy, you might prefer to hold certain types of investments in one account over another.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Think about the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each account in the future. Taxable accounts may be more suitable for short-term investments, while retirement accounts are designed for long-term savings.

6. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you also have an emergency fund in place. This should typically cover three to six months' worth of living expenses in easily accessible accounts, separate from your retirement accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Over time, revisit your allocations as your financial situation or retirement goals change. Regular reviews will help you stay on track toward your long-term objectives.
