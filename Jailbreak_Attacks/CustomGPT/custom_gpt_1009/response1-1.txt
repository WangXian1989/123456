When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and the rules governing each type of account. Here’s a general approach to help you think about it:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match for contributions to your 401(k), be sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit—it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction for the year you contribute, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Assess Tax Implications:** Contributions to a 401(k) and Traditional IRA lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as regular income. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, do not reduce your taxable income during contributions, but offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you have additional funds after maxing out your retirement accounts, taxable brokerage accounts are great for flexibility. You can withdraw funds without penalties, and you have a wider range of investment options.

5. **Diversification Among Accounts:** Consider diversifying investments across all accounts. This can help manage risk and provide tax-efficient growth. For example, you can hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) where interest income is taxed less favorably in taxable accounts.

6. **Re-evaluate Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change, so it's important to regularly re-evaluate your distribution strategy.

It might be wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances, especially regarding tax strategies and retirement planning.
