Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for a 401(k), which can change each year.

2. **IRA Accounts** (Traditional or Roth):
   - **Tax Considerations**: A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice may depend on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Similar to 401(k)s, there are annual limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts do not have the same contribution limits and can provide more flexibility for withdrawals.
   - **Investment Options**: You may want to hold investments with lower tax implications (like long-term capital gains) in a taxable account.

**Suggested Approach**:
- Maximize your employer match in your 401(k).
- Consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth, depending on your eligibility (like income limits for Roth IRAs).
- Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for funds beyond your tax-advantaged contributions.

It's also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation.
