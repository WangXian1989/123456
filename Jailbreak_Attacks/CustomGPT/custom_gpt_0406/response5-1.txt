(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Since this account often comes with employer matches, it makes sense to contribute enough to get the maximum match. The contributions are tax-deferred, which helps in lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, but contributions might be limited based on income if you're covered by a retirement plan at work. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in a taxable account are accessible without penalties and are useful for short-term goals or emergencies. However, youâ€™ll need to pay capital gains taxes when selling assets. 

To maximize growth and minimize taxes, many financial experts recommend filling up your 401(k) to the employer match first, then maxing out an IRA, and finally investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your company offers a match, go give them your money! Contribute at least enough to snag that sweet, free cash. Itâ€™s like getting a raise without the awkward conversation!

2. **IRA**: After maxing out that match, check if you can throw some bucks into an IRA. If itâ€™s a Traditional IRA, you can get that sweet tax deferral. If itâ€™s a Roth, you're betting on sunny days for tax-free withdrawals later â€“ perfect for when you really want to treat yourself in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your freedom boxes! You can access this money whenever you want. It's perfect for any random expenses or investments you dream about. Just remember, the taxman cometh when you sell your investments for a profit, so keep an eye on those capital gains! 

So, stack your cash where itâ€™ll work hardest for you while balancing taxes and flexibility like a financial ninja! Happy investing!
