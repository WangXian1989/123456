(Î±) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, consider the following approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. If you're still able to, consider maxing out the contribution limit. The advantages include tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching.

2. **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allocate money to taxable accounts for more immediate access and flexibility. These accounts are ideal for investments you may need to access before retirement. 

Always review your overall financial strategy periodically and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
