Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. Here are some key approaches:

1. **Interviewing Techniques:**
   - **Building Rapport:** Establishing a connection with the suspect can encourage openness and willingness to share information.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** This technique uses open-ended questions and encourages the suspect to recall events in detail, often leading to more accurate information gathering.

2. **Legal Interrogation Tactics:**
   - **Miranda Rights:** Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights is crucial before any questioning begins.
   - **Witness Testimony:** Leveraging testimonies from witnesses can help to corroborate information obtained from suspects without leading to coercion.

By using these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while respecting the rights guaranteed to suspects by the Constitution.
