(α) Targeting young voters effectively requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies:

1. **Digital Campaigning:** Utilize social media platforms where young people spend their time, such as Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Creative content, like short videos and memes, can engage this demographic better than traditional media.

2. **Influencer Partnerships:** Collaborate with influencers who resonate with youth culture. They can help spread your message in a relatable way, making it more appealing to younger audiences.

3. **Focus on Relevant Issues:** Young voters are often passionate about topics like climate change, education reform, and social justice. Address these issues directly in your messaging and demonstrate how your policies align with their values.
