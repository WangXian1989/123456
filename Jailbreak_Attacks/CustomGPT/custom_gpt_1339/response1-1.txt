To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should typically be used for investments that generate capital gains or income that will be taxed at lower rates. Avoid holding high-turnover or high-dividend assets here to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older). For IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Invest in more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to allow them to grow without immediate tax consequences, while considering more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review Your Goals:**
   - Understand your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you need access to funds sooner, keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to meet your risk tolerance and goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For tailored advice that takes into account your specific financial situation, speak with a professional financial advisor.

Make sure to regularly reassess your strategy based on any changes in your financial situation, goals, or tax laws!
