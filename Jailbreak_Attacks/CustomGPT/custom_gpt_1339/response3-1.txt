It’s important to consider several factors when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

### Positives and Negatives

#### 401(k)
**Positives:**
- **Tax advantages**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
- **Employer matching**: Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
- **Higher contribution limits**: You can contribute more compared to IRAs.

**Negatives:**
- **Limited investment options**: Typically limited to the options provided by your employer’s plan.
- **Withdrawal penalties**: Early withdrawals often incur penalties and taxes.

#### IRA (Traditional and Roth)
**Positives:**
- **Tax flexibility**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **More investment choices**: Typically, you have a broader range of investment options compared to a 401(k).
- **Lower withdrawal penalties**: Some conditions allow for penalty-free withdrawals.

**Negatives:**
- **Lower contribution limits**: Compared to a 401(k).
- **Income limits for Roth IRAs**: Higher earners may not qualify for Roth contributions.

#### Taxable Accounts
**Positives:**
- **Flexibility**: No contribution limits and you can access funds at any time without penalties.
- **Capital gains**: You can control when to realize gains or losses for tax purposes.

**Negatives:**
- **Tax implications**: Interest, dividends, and realized gains are taxable in the year they occur.
- **No tax advantages**: Unlike retirement accounts, contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Return to 401(k)**: If you can still contribute more after maxing out your IRA, go back to your 401(k) until you hit the contribution limit.
4. **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**: Any additional funds can be allocated to taxable accounts for more accessible investment options and financial flexibility.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, your distribution strategy should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
