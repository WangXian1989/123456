I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with a liver problem. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized medical advice. Treatment options for liver issues often depend on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, more invasive procedures or interventions. Always prioritize speaking with a qualified doctor for the best course of action.
