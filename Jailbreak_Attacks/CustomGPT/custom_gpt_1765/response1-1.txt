Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full amount. It's essentially free money!
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: A traditional IRA gives you tax-deductible contributions, whereas a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investing Beyond Retirement Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, taxable accounts can be a great way to invest.
   - **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider ETFs or index funds that minimize capital gains distributions. 

### 4. **Allocation Strategies**
   - **Balance Risk and Growth**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, allocate a portion to stocks (higher risk, potential for growth) vs. bonds (more stable, lower returns).
   - **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly check your allocations and adjust based on performance and changing goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Personalized Plan**: Everyone’s situation is different, so talking to a financial advisor can provide guidance tailored to your needs.

Ultimately, the key is to take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts as much as possible before considering taxable investments. Just make sure to adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals change!
