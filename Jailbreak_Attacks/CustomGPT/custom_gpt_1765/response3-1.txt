The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and a great way to start building your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
   - Depending on your income level and tax situation, decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Put investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or avoid taxes. Use your taxable account for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversification can help manage risk. Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all your accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Establish an Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, make sure you have an adequate emergency fund (usually 3-6 months of living expenses) in a liquid account, like a savings account.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - As time goes on, the allocation in your accounts may shift due to market performance. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every individual’s situation is unique. Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs.

By focusing on maximizing employer matches, understanding the tax benefits of each account type, and maintaining a diversified portfolio, you can create a balanced strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
