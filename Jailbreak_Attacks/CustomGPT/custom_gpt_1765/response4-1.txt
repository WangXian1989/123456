When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get that full match. This is essentially “free money” that can help grow your retirement savings faster.
   - **IRA:** After getting the match, consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth). Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Diversification of Accounts**
   - Aim for a balance between tax-deferred (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts. This strategy could provide flexibility in retirement regarding tax liabilities. 

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts can be beneficial. Conversely, if you think your tax rate will decrease, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be preferable.

### 4. **Consider Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - Allocate money based on your investment timeframe. If your goals are long-term (like retirement), you can afford to take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, consider keeping money in taxable accounts where you can easily access it.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts can go into taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, but you’ll pay capital gains taxes on any earnings.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, performance, and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
In essence, focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs before moving onto taxable accounts. This strategy will help you take advantage of the potential tax benefits these accounts offer. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.
