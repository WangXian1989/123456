Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It's free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional) if you qualify. This offers tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Continue with 401(k):** After maxing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Aim for pre-tax contributions for tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for extra savings or investments once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility for withdrawals but may have tax implications on gains.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified in terms of asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash).

6. **Review Regularly:** Reassess your distribution strategy periodically based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your personal situation.
