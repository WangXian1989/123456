To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your contributions for tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Use them for higher-growth investments that will benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate capital gains rather than regular income (such as stocks). This allows you to minimize taxes over time.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Adjust your investment mix based on accounts. For instance:
     - Higher-risk investments (like stocks) can go in your 401(k) and IRA.
     - More stable investments (like bonds or cash) might be suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. Generally, itâ€™s better to draw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Review Annually**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By focusing on these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
