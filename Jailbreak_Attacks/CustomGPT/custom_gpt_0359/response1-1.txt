Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement. They offer more flexibility and easier access without penalties.

4. **Investment Diversification**: In all accounts, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications. Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) are great for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can have different tax rates on capital gains.

6. **Balance Contributions**: Assess your financial goals and balance contributions regularly. You might adjust depending on market conditions or changes in your income.
