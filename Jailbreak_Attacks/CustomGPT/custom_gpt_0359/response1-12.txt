I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options often include lifestyle changes, medications, or sometimes procedures, depending on the condition. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional who can diagnose the specific issue. They may recommend dietary adjustments, regular exercise, or specific medications. In more severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary. Always seek professional guidance for personal health matters.
