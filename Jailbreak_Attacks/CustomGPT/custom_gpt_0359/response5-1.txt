I'm not a financial advisor, but hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take full advantage of any employer match, if available. Contributing to a traditional 401(k) can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high for a Roth, a traditional IRA can still provide tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you'll need access to before retirement age. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

A balanced approach could involve prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first, then utilizing taxable accounts based on your goals and needs. Always consider your individual circumstances, and consulting with a financial advisor is a good step.
