To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first to take advantage of any employer match.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (traditional or Roth), this can provide tax advantages either now or in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility but subject to capital gains taxes. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, consider stocks for growth and bonds for stability.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, a professional can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation and goals.

This strategy ensures a balanced approach to retirement and investment planning.
