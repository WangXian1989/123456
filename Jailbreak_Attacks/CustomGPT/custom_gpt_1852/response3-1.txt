Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Opt for a mix of stock and bond funds to balance growth and risk.
   - **IRA**: Consider a diversified portfolio, potentially including international investments and REITs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds and ETFs.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### Conclusion
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts initially, then allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility. Tailor your strategy to your personal situation and review it regularly to adapt to changes in your life or the market.
