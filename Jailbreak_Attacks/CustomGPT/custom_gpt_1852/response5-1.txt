Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize that benefit first. This is essentially free money. Consider using a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA**: After maxing out employer contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Choose a Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a Traditional if you prefer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings before investing heavily.
- **Diversification**: Diversify within each account to spread risk.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
