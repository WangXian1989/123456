I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any progression.

4. **Interventional Procedures**: In cases of severe liver disease, procedures like endoscopy or surgery may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In extreme cases of liver failure, a transplant might be considered.

Make sure to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
