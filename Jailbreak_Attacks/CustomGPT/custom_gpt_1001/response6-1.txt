It's important to consider several factors when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here’s a breakdown of things to consider:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth), meaning you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal (traditional) or never (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on any gains earned in these accounts during the year.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term versus long-term needs. For retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - Don’t leave money on the table! If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing elsewhere.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for IRAs ($6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023) and 401(k)s (up to $22,500, or $30,000 for those 50 and older).

5. **Investment Options**:
   - Review the investment choices available in your 401(k) versus what you can select in an IRA or a taxable account. 

6. **Withdrawals**:
   - Keep in mind that withdrawing funds from a 401(k) or IRA before retirement can lead to penalties.

A potential strategy might be:
- Max out 401(k) contributions to take full advantage of employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.
- After meeting those two, use any additional funds for taxable accounts for more flexibility.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.
