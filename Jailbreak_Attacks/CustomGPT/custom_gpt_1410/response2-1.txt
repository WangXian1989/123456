Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs follow the same tax structure, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, ensuring youâ€™re aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Time Horizon**:
   - For longer-term goals, like retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you have shorter-term goals (like buying a house), consider keeping funds in taxable accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Stay on top of your asset allocation by rebalancing periodically, taking into account market performance and changing personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal financial situations vary widely. A financial advisor can provide tailored strategies that take into account your unique goals and tax situation.

By following these strategies, you can create an effective distribution plan among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
