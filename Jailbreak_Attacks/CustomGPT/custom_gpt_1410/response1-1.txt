Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maxing out the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum contribution limit. This reduces your taxable income and grows your retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maximizing retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might favor higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation is always a good idea.
