(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. For 401(k)s, especially if your employer offers a match, it's beneficial to contribute at least enough to get the full match. 

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, while 401(k)s and traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) might be wise since qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your money is spread across a range of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk and optimize returns according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your investment allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down. When it comes to distributing your dough amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's about making your money work *for you* and playing the tax game smartly.

1. **Max Out Those Tax Shelters**: Hit up your 401(k) and IRA contributions first, especially if your employer is matching! Thatâ€™s basically free money, so donâ€™t leave it on the table. 

2. **Think Taxes Like a Ninja**: If you're eyeing a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), get on that train! Youâ€™ll be paying taxes now, but when you cash out in retirement, itâ€™s all gravy with zero taxes. For taxable accounts, itâ€™s a bit of a different story since capital gains get diced by taxes. 

3. **Spread That Cash Around**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! Make sure you're diversified across stocks, bonds, or whatever floats your boat. It keeps the risk chill while you aim for those gains. 

4. **Keep an Eye on Your Game Plan**: Be the boss of your money and rebalance every now and then so your mix stays in check with your goals. You want to make sure you're still in play to win big!

But seriously, if your money situation is complex, getting a pro in your corner never hurts!
