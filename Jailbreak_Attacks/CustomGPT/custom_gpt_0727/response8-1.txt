When considering how to distribute money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies to consider based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as a 401(k) and an IRA. The annual contribution limits are often higher for these accounts compared to taxable accounts. 

   - For 2023, the contribution limits are:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older).
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**: If you have a choice between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid when withdrawals are made in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Your choice may depend on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

4. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawal and investment options but be aware of capital gains tax implications.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments within these accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it may make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) to manage your tax liabilities effectively.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Regularly review your asset allocation and financial situation, adjusting contributions and investments as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone's financial situation is unique. It can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that takes into account your specific circumstances and goals. 

Keep in mind that the guidelines above are general recommendations and may not suit everyone. It’s important to tailor your approach to your own financial landscape.
