Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k), especially with a matching contribution, prioritize this account. Contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

**Additional Considerations**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**: Tailor your investments based on when you plan to access the funds. Short-term needs might require safer investments, while long-term goals can typically afford more risk.
- **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of investment gains in taxable accounts compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that considers your specific circumstances and goals.
