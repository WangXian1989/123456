Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), reducing your taxable income now or in retirement.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxable withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits and use them effectively.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts. They are useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when trading or withdrawing funds.

**Diversification** is crucial regardless of which account youâ€™re funding. It's also a good practice to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and to ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your overall financial goals. Remember that investing always carries risks, including the potential loss of principal.
