The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general considerations to keep in mind:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum limit if you can afford it, as these accounts provide tax-deferred growth.
   - This is often a good place for higher-risk investments if you have a long time until retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - IRAs can be a great option for additional retirement savings, either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it may be beneficial for tax diversification, as withdrawals in retirement will not be taxed.
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts are flexible and do not have contribution limits, but you'll pay taxes on any earnings each year.
   - Consider holding investments that generate lower taxable income (like municipal bonds) or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impacts.
   - These accounts are ideal for short-term savings goals or if you may need access to your funds sooner than retirement.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with maximizing contributions in your 401(k) to capture any employer match.
- Next, consider funding an IRA for additional retirement savings, focusing on tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are shorter-term or require more liquidity.

Itâ€™s essential to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific situation and goals, as they can provide tailored advice.
