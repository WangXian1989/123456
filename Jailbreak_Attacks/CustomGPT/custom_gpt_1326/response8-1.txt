The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred (or tax-free, in the case of Roth accounts) until retirement.

3. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to benefit from any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you’re eligible (especially if it’s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

4. **IRA**: If you're eligible for a tax-deductible IRA, consider contributing to that next, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. 

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts can provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but will be subject to capital gains tax on any profits.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and diversification goals. Generally, you may want to hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for better tax efficiency.

7. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about your tax situation now compared to expectations for retirement. For example, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA contribution might make more sense than a traditional IRA.

8. **Regular Reviews**: Revisit your strategy periodically or when significant financial changes occur in your life. 

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to get personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, as they can provide detailed insights and strategies based on your current financial standing and future goals.
