When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Benefits**: Often comes with employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Considerations**: Limited investment choices and potential fees associated with the plan.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Types**: Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) and Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Benefits**: More investment options than most 401(k)s and potential tax benefits, especially with Roth IRAs.
   - **Considerations**: Contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Benefits**: Flexibility to withdraw funds at any time without penalties and no contribution limits.
   - **Considerations**: Capital gains taxes on investment profits and no tax advantages.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Consider Tax Implications**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions. If you believe it will be lower, focus on pre-tax contributions (traditional 401(k)/IRA).
- **Diverse Investment**: Use your IRA and taxable accounts for more diverse investments that may not be available in your 401(k).
- **Emergency Savings**: Maintain an adequate amount in taxable accounts for emergency funds, as they provide the easiest access to cash.

**Reassess and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on your financial goals, changes in income, and market performance.

It's always best to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
