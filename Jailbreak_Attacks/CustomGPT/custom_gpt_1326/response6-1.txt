When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to understand the benefits and characteristics of each type of account. Here are some points to consider for effective allocation:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. It grows tax-deferred until withdrawal, usually at retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, and the growth is tax-deferred. Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, offering less tax sheltering compared to the other accounts.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If your retirement is far away, prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA for their tax advantages.
   - For more immediate goals (e.g., buying a home), a taxable account may be suitable due to its liquidity.

**General Strategy**:
- Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."
- Fund your IRA next, taking advantage of tax benefits. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider this for tax-free growth.
- Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

**Consult with a Financial Advisor**: While this framework offers a strong foundation for allocation, individual circumstances vary greatly. It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for tailored guidance.
