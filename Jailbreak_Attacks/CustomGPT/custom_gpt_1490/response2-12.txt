I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health. Treatment options for liver problems can vary significantly depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help your liver function properly.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the liver condition, your doctor may prescribe medications. For example:
   - Antivirals for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring & Follow-up**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol is crucial for anyone with liver problems, as it can worsen liver damage.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, such as end-stage liver disease, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
