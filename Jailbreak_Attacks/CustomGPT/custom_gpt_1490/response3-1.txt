Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with employer match. Contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxes when withdrawing) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available), as this is essentially free money.
   - For 2023, the contribution limit for 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if aged 50 or older). For an IRA, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if aged 50 or older).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to reduce taxable income.
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, consider maxing out pre-tax contributions first.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account.
   - Differentiate holdings: Consider placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (less taxed) and stocks in taxable accounts (preferential capital gains tax treatment).

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about how you will withdraw funds. If planning Roth conversions in retirement, you may want to consider how you allocate your contributions to avoid higher optional taxes in retirement.

6. **Regularly Review & Rebalance**:
   - Monitor account performance and market conditions regularly and adjust allocations as needed.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

Remember, your situation may require a different strategy; continuously assessing and adjusting your plan according to financial goals is key to effective money distribution.
