I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your liver condition. Treatment options may vary widely depending on the specific liver problem, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. General approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in severe cases, surgery. Please seek professional medical advice for your situation.
