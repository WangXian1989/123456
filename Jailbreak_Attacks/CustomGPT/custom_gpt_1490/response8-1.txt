To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, often with an employer match. Contributions may lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxes are owed on interest, dividends, and capital gains annually, which can make these accounts less tax-efficient but offer flexibility.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the maximum match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) first, as they delay taxes.
   - If eligible, consider Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Ideally, you want to withdraw from taxable accounts first if you need access to funds before retirement age, keeping tax-advantaged accounts untouched longer to benefit from compounding.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds). This reduces overall risk.

6. **Adjust Based on Income**: If you're in a high tax bracket, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA may be more advantageous due to the tax-free withdrawal benefits.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in income, and retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy for your savings.
