Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional), depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've funded your IRA up to its maximum limit, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach its contribution limit. This helps you maximize your tax-deferred growth.

4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After you've contributed the maximum to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer more liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals, but keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep your investment strategy in mind; certain investments generate income that could be taxed at a higher rate in taxable accounts. For instance, index funds or ETFs are generally more tax-efficient than actively managed funds.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

7. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on your changing financial goals, market conditions, and risk tolerance.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances and to ensure you are making the best choices for your retirement planning.
