Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). 

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - Adhere to contribution limits for each account type. For 401(k)s, the limit for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts When Necessary**: 
   - After you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties before retirement.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Generally, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s) to minimize tax impact now, and consider Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals later.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: 
   - Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: 
   - Annually reassess your account balances, contributions, and overall investment strategy to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice suited to your specific situation and objectives.
