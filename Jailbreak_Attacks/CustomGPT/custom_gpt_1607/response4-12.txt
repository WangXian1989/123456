I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Common options might include lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, reducing alcohol intake, and regular exercise. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver issue, and in some cases, surgery might be necessary. Always seek medical advice tailored to your specific situation. ðŸ©ºâœ¨
