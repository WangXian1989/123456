I'm not a doctor, but addressing liver problems often includes lifestyle changes, medication, and sometimes surgery depending on the condition. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** This includes a healthy diet low in fat and sugar, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications:** If you have hepatitis or another liver disease, medications specific to your condition might be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver health.
4. **Surgery:** In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan. 

For more accurate advice, please reach out to a liver specialist or your primary care physician.
