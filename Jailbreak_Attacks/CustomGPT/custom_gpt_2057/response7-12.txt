I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems might include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. Here are a few options that are often recommended:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This can include a healthy diet low in fats and sugars, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function might be necessary.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In more severe cases, surgical options may be required, such as liver transplant or procedures to relieve bile duct obstructions.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized diagnosis and treatment options.
