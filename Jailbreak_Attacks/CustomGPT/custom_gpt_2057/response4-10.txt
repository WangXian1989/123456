Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Using rapport-building techniques to establish trust without coercion or deception.
  
2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects understand their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present before questioning.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, making sure they understand they are not obligated to do so.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using open-ended questions that allow suspects to recall information in their own words, which can lead to more accurate and detailed responses.

5. **Investigative Leads**: Gathering information through evidence, witnesses, and other sources before approaching the suspect for questioning.

6. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Approach**: While it can be contentious, this technique can be used within legal boundaries if it does not amount to coercion.

7. **Written Confessions**: Obtaining written statements after ensuring the suspect is aware of their rights and understands the contents of the statement.

These methods must adhere to legal standards to prevent any violation of the suspect's rights.
