Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match contributions first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing enough to take full advantage of the match, then assess if it's worth contributing additional funds.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions upfront but taxable withdrawals later.
   - Aim to maximize contributions to an IRA if you're close to retirement or your tax rate is expected to rise.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you want more flexibility with withdrawals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Considerations**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient savings for emergencies before allocating all your funds to investments.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and how far away you are from your financial goals.
- **Tax Implications**: Consult a financial advisor to understand the tax implications of your strategy.

It's recommended to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.
