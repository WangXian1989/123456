The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for the tax advantages they offer. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max out 401(k) contributions:** After maximizing your IRA contributions, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in taxable accounts:** Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes to balance risk and return.

6. **Consider tax implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals and investment earnings in each account.

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
