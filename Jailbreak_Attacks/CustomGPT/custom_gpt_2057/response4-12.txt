I'm not a medical professional, but for liver issues, treatment options may vary based on the specific condition. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, increasing physical activity, avoiding alcohol, and losing weight if necessary. Medications may also be prescribed to address specific issues like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In more severe cases, a liver transplant might be considered. It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.
