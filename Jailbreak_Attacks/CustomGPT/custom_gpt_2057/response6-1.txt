To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or stocks held for the long term. This can help minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals across all account types.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial objectives and market changes.

By balancing these elements, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications.
