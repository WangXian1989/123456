Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   
3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid, safe account.

4. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying this down before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, or target-date funds tailored to your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but you might have access to a broader range of investments. Consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments you may need access to in the short term. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically (e.g., annually) to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your unique situation, consulting a professional might be beneficial.

This strategy balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential while considering liquidity needs.
