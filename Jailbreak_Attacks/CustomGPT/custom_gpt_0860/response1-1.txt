Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funding goals that are shorter-term (like buying a home or saving for a childâ€™s education). These accounts allow for more flexibility but also come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before making large contributions, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your life circumstances, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
