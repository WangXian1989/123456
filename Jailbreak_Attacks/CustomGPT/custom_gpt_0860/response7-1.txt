Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is free money. If possible, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you meet income requirements. If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA may provide tax benefits.

2. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - Look at the investment options available in your 401(k)—some might be better or worse than what you can get in an IRA or taxable account.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Taxable accounts are less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes on earnings. Keep investments that generate ordinary income in tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds) and consider placing stocks in taxable accounts for favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

4. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities of individual finances, consulting a financial professional can help tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific situation. 

Balancing short-term liquidity needs with long-term growth potential will guide your decisions effectively.
