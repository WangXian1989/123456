I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on common treatments for liver problems depending on the specific condition. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized approach. Here are some general options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can help prevent further liver damage.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight if you are overweight can reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Specific medications can treat underlying conditions like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate drugs based on your diagnosis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and structure.

4. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases, where liver function is significantly impaired, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: 
   - Some people explore supplements like milk thistle or turmeric for liver health, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Consulting a gastroenterologist or hepatologist will provide a more tailored treatment plan based on your liver condition.
