It's important to have a diversified and balanced investment strategy that suits your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines for distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, it's generally advisable to contribute enough to at least get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to the IRA**: After taking full advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Balance Between Accounts**: Depending on your financial situation, you might want to prioritize contributions to the account that provides the most tax benefits. For example, if you're in a higher tax bracket, a traditional 401(k) or IRA might be more beneficial than a taxable account.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties, which can be appealing if you have short- to medium-term financial goals.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Ensure to regularly review your investment allocations and adjust based on changes in your life circumstances, market conditions, and financial goals.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that best fits your needs.
