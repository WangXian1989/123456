It's important to create a balanced investment strategy when distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, as each has its own tax implications, contribution limits, and withdrawal rules. Here's a general approach you could consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are age 50 or older). 
   - The IRA contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). If your income allows, consider fully funding your IRA as well.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - For your 401(k) and traditional IRA, contributions are tax-deductible. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met. Consider your current tax bracket versus your expected bracket in retirement when deciding between traditional and Roth accounts.

3. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses, preferably in a high-yield savings account.

4. **Diversification Across Types of Investments**:
   - Within your accounts, diversify your investments by asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors. Use a mix of aggressive and conservative investments based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your investment mix and contributions based on performance, financial goals, and changes in life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about your investment strategy, consult a financial advisor for tailored advice that aligns with your goals and circumstances.

By structuring your investments according to these guidelines, you can optimize your returns and manage your tax liabilities effectively.
