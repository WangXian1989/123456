The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider contributing the maximum if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (after-tax), your contributions can affect your current tax situation. Roth IRAs can be appealing if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Diversification and Liquidity Considerations**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are suitable for savings you might need in the short term or for investments that you believe will generate long-term capital gains. Capital gains in these accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Consider the types of investments best suited for each account. For instance, hold higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without being taxed until withdrawal. 

5. **Adjust for Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Younger investors may choose to allocate more to stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds or stable investments to preserve capital.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial needs and market conditions change, so it’s essential to review your asset allocation periodically and adjust as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, including risk tolerance and financial goals.
