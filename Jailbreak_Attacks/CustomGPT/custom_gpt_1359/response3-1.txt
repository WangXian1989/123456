To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50) for the year 2023.
   - **IRA**: Limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for the year 2023.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to capture the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now. Consider contributing to this account first, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible now (Traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth). Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rate.

4. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Keep in mind the investment options available in each account. Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Taxable accounts can hold investments with lower turnover rates, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events. Use these accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement.

6. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review your portfolio allocation at least once a year to adjust based on performance, changing goals, or risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual circumstances vary greatly, so it may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By combining these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective approach to funding your retirement and investment goals.
