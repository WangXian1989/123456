I'm unable to provide personalized investment advice. However, I can share some general considerations for distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize this to maximize the benefit. 

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between them may depend on your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subjected to capital gains tax on earnings, so they may be suitable for investments you plan to access before retirement or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

A commonly used strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate additional funds to a taxable account based on your cash flow and investment goals. Always consider your individual financial situation and consult with a financial advisor when making investment decisions.
