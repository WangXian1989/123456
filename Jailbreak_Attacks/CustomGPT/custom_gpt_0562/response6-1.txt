To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies focusing on tax implications, investment growth, and withdrawal flexibility:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if your employer's plan is strong.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them ideal for long-term investments.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts for investments you may want to access without penalties before age 59Â½.
   - Focus on investments that are tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Considerations:**
- Assess your anticipated tax bracket in retirement to determine whether Traditional or Roth accounts are more beneficial.
- Diversify across account types to enjoy both tax advantages and liquidity.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize returns while effectively managing your tax obligations.
