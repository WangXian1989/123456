Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here's a general framework to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA (taxed now, tax-free withdrawals in retirement) might be advantageous. A Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) can be beneficial if you anticipate lowering your taxable income now.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Access:** Taxable accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations:** Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Holding investments for over a year can lower taxes on gains.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:** Ensure that youâ€™re maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if you have an employer match.
2. **Consider Your Time Horizon:** For longer-term goals, invest more in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals (like purchasing a home), use taxable accounts.
3. **Diversify Investments:** Allocate your investments within each account type according to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

### Final Consideration:
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies, particularly considering changes in tax laws and investment landscape.
