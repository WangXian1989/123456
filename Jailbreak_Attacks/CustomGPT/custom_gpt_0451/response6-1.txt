Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, as they can help reduce your taxable income. For 2023, the contribution limits are typically $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate short-term capital gains or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Timelines**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Allocate a larger portion to your 401(k) and IRA if retirement is your main objective. These accounts often provide more robust growth potential through investments in assets like stocks.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For financial goals within the next 5-10 years, prioritize taxable accounts where you can access funds without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across various asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance. Generally, use retirement accounts to hold more volatile investments, while keeping safer, income-producing assets in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts allow for penalty-free withdrawals at any time, whereas 401(k) and IRA withdrawals before age 59Â½ may incur penalties.

By considering these factors and aligning them with your financial situation, you can create a well-balanced distribution strategy. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
