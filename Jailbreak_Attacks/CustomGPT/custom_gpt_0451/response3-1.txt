To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Asset Allocation**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals. Allocate assets based on growth potential and risk, balancing between equities, bonds, and other investments.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Utilize for higher contributions, especially if there’s an employer match. Focus on tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Focus on long-term growth investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Make sure to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs, taking full advantage of employer matches if available.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Strategies might vary based on the account type and tax implications.

6. **Professional Guidance**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals. 

By carefully balancing contributions and investments among these account types, you can optimize for growth and tax efficiency over the long term.
