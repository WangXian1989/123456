When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re 50 or older), and for a traditional or Roth IRA, it’s $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of each account. Generally, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs) to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Flexible Withdrawals**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which might be useful for short-term goals. Ensure some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.

5. **Adjust Risk Based on Time Horizon**: The longer the time until you need the funds (e.g., retirement), the more risk you can typically take in your investments. This might influence how you allocate funds between these accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and investment styles, regardless of the account type.

7. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation and goals.
