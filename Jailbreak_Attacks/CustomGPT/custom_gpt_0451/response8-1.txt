Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach that takes into account your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, and investment growth is tax-deferred. Consider contributing up to the maximum allowable limit.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). If you qualify, consider maxing this out as well.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for medium- to short-term goals, as the capital gains tax will apply when you sell investments. They offer flexibility, but be mindful of tax implications on gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Consider using a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, drawing from taxable accounts first can help preserve tax-advantaged accounts for longer.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and changes in tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth while minimizing tax liability over time.
