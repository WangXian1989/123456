When considering the optimal distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until you withdraw funds. Prioritize maxing out contributions to these accounts, especially if your employer matches contributions in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here for goals with shorter time horizons. You'll pay capital gains taxes on profits, so it's wise to hold investments long-term to minimize these taxes.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you are aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (plus $7,500 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 if you're over 50).

3. **Investment Growth**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize the benefit of tax-deferred growth. More stable investments (like bonds) might be better suited for taxable accounts due to lower capital gains rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy carefully. Understand the required minimum distributions (RMDs) for traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, starting at age 73.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals, which could incur penalties and taxes.

6. **Financial Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals. For short-term goals, prioritize liquidity. For long-term goals, consider aggressive growth strategies.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, make contributions to an IRA to take advantage of its tax benefits.
- **Additional Contributions**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts.

### Sample Allocation (Hypothetical):
- **401(k)**: 60% of total contributions (until match is maxed)
- **IRA**: 20% of total contributions
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% of total contributions

This would ensure a balanced approach, leveraging the tax advantages of retirement accounts while maintaining flexibility with taxable accounts. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
