Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're under 50, you can contribute up to $22,500 in 2023. Keep in mind that contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: You can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50) in a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction for contributions, whereas a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor the Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - For lower current income, a traditional IRA or 401(k) (pre-tax contributions) may be beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement, since they donâ€™t have the same restrictions as retirement accounts. 

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to minimize risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Adviser**: Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting with a financial adviser for personalized advice.

The best strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, including your age, income level, risk tolerance, and the specific investment options available in your accounts.
