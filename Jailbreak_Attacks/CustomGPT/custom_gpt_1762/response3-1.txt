To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) up to the allowable limits. This helps you reduce taxable income now.

3. **Roth Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. They offer more flexibility but are taxed on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation, consult a financial advisor.

By following these steps, you can better allocate your investments for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
