To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k):** Maximize employer match first. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. If possible, aim for the maximum annual contribution limit.

2. **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions (depending on income and retirement plan coverage).

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maxing out retirement accounts. This allows for flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age. Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure all accounts are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changes in your financial situation or goals.

Seek professional advice tailored to your specific circumstances for best results.
