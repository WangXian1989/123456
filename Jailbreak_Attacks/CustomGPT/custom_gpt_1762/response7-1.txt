To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for current tax deductions.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals to decide on a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Generally, you might want more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes within each account to reduce risk.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Automate contributions to each account based on your budget and financial goals, maintaining a consistent investment strategy.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals, especially after significant market movements.

7. **Consider Future Tax Brackets**:
   - Plan distributions from your accounts based on your expected tax situation in retirement. Distributions from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across these accounts.
