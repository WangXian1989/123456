Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, especially if you are in a high tax bracket, to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your eligibility. A Roth is great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas a traditional IRA gives you upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve maxed out retirement accounts, then invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

Consider age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline in your distribution strategy. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
