Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Prioritize contributions** to your 401(k) up to the company match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. A good choice if you expect your tax rate to increase.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments without penalty. Consider using these for shorter-term goals or as an emergency fund.

### 4. **Balance Investments Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize tax on gains. Keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxation better.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Annually**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help tailor a strategy that aligns with your goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to match)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for individuals under 50 for 2023)
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds after maxing out the above accounts.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that works for your unique financial situation.
