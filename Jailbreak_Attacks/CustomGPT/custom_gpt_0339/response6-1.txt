To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the yearly contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions if you're eligible, especially if you can access a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Your Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Diversify across various asset classes. Consider funds with low expense ratios.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Prioritize long-term investments to benefit from lower tax rates.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawals and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Withdrawals may incur taxes. Plan for retirement needs accordingly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or emergencies as they offer more flexibility without penalties.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in market conditions, life circumstances, or retirement timelines.

Implementing these strategies can optimize your savings for both growth and tax efficiency, helping you reach your financial goals more effectively.
