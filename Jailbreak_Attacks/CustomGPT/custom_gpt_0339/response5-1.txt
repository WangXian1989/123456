Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Contribute up to the annual limit, focusing on tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA (or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out retirement accounts. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or tax-exempt bonds.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of taxes on withdrawals from traditional accounts versus tax-free Roth withdrawals.
- **Investment Goals**: Adjust the allocation based on when you need the money.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your portfolio reflects your risk tolerance across all accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan based on your unique circumstances.
