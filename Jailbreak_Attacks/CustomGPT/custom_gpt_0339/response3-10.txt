Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques to create a non-threatening environment, encouraging suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Properly informing suspects of their rights to counsel and against self-incrimination before any interrogation begins, ensuring they understand their rights.

3. **Evidence Presentation**: Presenting evidence in a way that challenges the suspectâ€™s narrative without coercion, prompting them to provide their side of the story.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using special questioning techniques that help witnesses or suspects recall information more accurately without leading or suggestive questioning.

5. **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking questions that allow suspects to elaborate on their answers, promoting dialogue rather than yes/no responses.

6. **Psychological Techniques**: Utilizing psychological strategies to encourage suspects to reveal information without manipulation or deception.

7. **Building Trust**: Ensuring that communication is respectful, and showing empathy can lead to more openness from suspects.

These methods aim to ensure that any information obtained is admissible in court and respects the legal rights of the individuals involved.
