To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your current tax bracket.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in lower turnover investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains if applicable.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher growth assets (like stocks) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Hold bonds and other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of tax treatment.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and sectors, regardless of the account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Consider your retirement age, income needs, and risk tolerance when making decisions for each account.
