Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA next. A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while traditional IRAs can provide a tax deduction.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k), focusing on the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access sooner or for investments that might generate favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Keep fixed-income investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from your investments.

7. **Revisit and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
