Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) before adding more to your 401(k).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes when investments are sold, but offer more flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment choices within these accounts are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re far from retirement, you might consider being more aggressive in your investments. If retirement is approaching, shifting to more conservative investments may be wise.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolios periodically to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have a separate emergency fund before investing heavily in your accounts.

8. **Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a distribution plan that fits your unique situation.

Balancing contributions across these accounts ensures you leverage tax benefits while planning for retirement effectively.
