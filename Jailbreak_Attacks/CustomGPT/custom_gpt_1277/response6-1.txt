I can help with that! To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Investment Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - **Time Horizon**: Consider how long you plan to invest before needing to access these funds.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Usually offers tax advantages, especially if your employer matches contributions. Focus on maximizing any matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: These accounts provide specific tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but might come with tax implications on gains and dividends. Use this account for investments that generate lower tax burdens.

### 3. **Strategy for Distribution**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**: 
     - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to take full advantage of tax deferral.
     - Hold income-generating assets in taxable accounts, as they incur capital gains taxes at a potentially lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your investment mix and adjust based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

### 4. **Consider Professional Advice**
   - If youâ€™re unsure about asset allocation or have a complex financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights and strategies.
