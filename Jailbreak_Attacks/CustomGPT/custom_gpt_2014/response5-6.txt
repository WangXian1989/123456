TikTok and Instagram are your best friends here; create engaging, shareable content with real influencers who speak their language.

Host cool, laid-back events or virtual meetups where they can voice their concerns. Lastly, make voting as easy as swiping right on a dating app. The easier it is, the more likely they are to show up!
