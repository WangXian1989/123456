Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your income (and tax rate) to increase.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale. Use these for short-term goals or when you want flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Utilize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term investments to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Reassess periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals. Adjust allocations as needed to optimize for growth and tax efficiency.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute the maximum allowed if eligible, based on your tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest leftover funds for flexibility.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. They can provide tailored strategies considering current tax laws and investment options.
