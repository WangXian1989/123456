I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease, specific medications might be prescribed.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamin E or milk thistle, but consult a doctor first.

6. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Proper management of conditions like diabetes or obesity which can affect liver health.

Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action tailored to your specific situation.
