Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions, particularly if you haven't reached the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement. These accounts can provide flexibility, but consider tax implications strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Consider asset allocation strategies that suit your goals.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly reassess your asset distribution based on changing financial circumstances, market conditions, or shifts in goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific situation.

This structured approach balances the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts with the need for liquidity and flexibility in taxable accounts.
