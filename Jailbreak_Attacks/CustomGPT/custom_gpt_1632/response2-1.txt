Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate favorable capital gains. They may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer-term investments might benefit from being in a 401(k) or IRA for growth.
   - Shorter-term needs could be better suited to taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset mix.

Consult a financial advisor to create a tailored plan based on your specific situation.
