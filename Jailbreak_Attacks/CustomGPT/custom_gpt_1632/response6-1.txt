Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are taxed annually, but offer flexibility.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Focus:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for more liquidity and easier access.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** Higher annual limit compared to IRAs.
   - **IRA:** Consider both traditional and Roth contributions.

### 4. **Employer Match**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of employer matching.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### General Strategy
- **Max Out Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k).
- **Fund an IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for surplus funds or for intermediate goals.
