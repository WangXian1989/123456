3. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers to reach a wider audience and establish credibility.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use polls, challenges, and user-generated content to encourage participation and engagement.

5. **Focus on Issues**: Highlight policies that directly impact their lives, like education, job opportunities, and healthcare.

6. **Voter Education**: Provide clear, accessible information on the voting process, including registration and polling locations.
