To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute the maximum allowed. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA provides an upfront tax deduction.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial. In higher brackets, focus on traditional accounts for immediate tax savings.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on gains. Use tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice may also be beneficial.
