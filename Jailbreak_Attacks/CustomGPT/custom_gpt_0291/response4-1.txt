To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both are tax-advantaged accounts. Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax deductions now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals but contributions are made post-tax.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - Allocate more to aggressive growth in accounts meant for long-term goals (like retirement).
   - For short-term goals, consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance and life changes.
