I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver problems typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and limiting alcohol intake can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Weight Management**: For fatty liver disease, losing weight can reduce liver fat and improve function.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from harmful substances, including certain medications and herbs, is crucial.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

Consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice is essential.
