Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your eligibility for tax deductions (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth), prioritize contributing to an IRA next.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, maxing out tax-deferred accounts like a Traditional IRA or 401(k) can reduce your taxable income now.
   - Roth accounts may be better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as they allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. These can be ideal for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate fewer taxable events.

### 4. **Maintain a Balanced Approach:**
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. A diversified mix can reduce overall risk.

### 5. **Revisit and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your goals and changing financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
