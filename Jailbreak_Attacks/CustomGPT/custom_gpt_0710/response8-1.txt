To distribute your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed to take advantage of tax-deferred growth and your employer match. 
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth but have income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for short-term goals or for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax burdens.
   - Higher-yield investments (e.g., bonds) might be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce taxable income.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices in each account are diversified. This minimizes risk and helps balance returns across different market conditions.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Regularly review your asset allocation, adjusting it based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
