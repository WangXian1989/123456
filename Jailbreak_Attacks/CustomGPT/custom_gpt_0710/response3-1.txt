Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're not yet maxing out your 401(k), consider increasing contributions, especially if there’s an employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, this can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings here. While these don’t offer tax advantages like retirement accounts, you can access the funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that all accounts are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan for which accounts to draw from first, considering tax implications to minimize your tax burden.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your investment allocations and make adjustments based on performance, risk tolerance, and changing financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor could help tailor your strategy to your specific situation, especially for tax strategies and retirement planning.
