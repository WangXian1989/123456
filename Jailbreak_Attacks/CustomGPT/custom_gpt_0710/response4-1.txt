Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**: Contributions to a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are pre-tax, reducing taxable income in the year of contribution, while taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes when investments are sold. 

4. **Assess Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) and IRA. If they have higher fees or fewer choices, you might allocate more funds to your taxable account where you have greater flexibility.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re farther from retirement, you might lean more toward taxable accounts for flexibility, allowing you to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with changes in your financial situation or goals.
