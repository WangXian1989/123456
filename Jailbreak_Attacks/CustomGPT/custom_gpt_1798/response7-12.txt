I'm here to help with your questions related to FINA 6201 and 6205 course materials. However, discussing medical conditions or treatments isn't within the scope of these materials. I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for your liver problem. If you have specific questions about finance or related topics in your course, feel free to ask!
