I'm here to help with your course materials for FINA 6201 and 6205. If you'd like to review a specific topic related to those courses or work on a problem, please let me know! If you have questions about law enforcement methods or constitutional rights outside of the course content, I recommend referring to the relevant materials or asking a legal expert.
