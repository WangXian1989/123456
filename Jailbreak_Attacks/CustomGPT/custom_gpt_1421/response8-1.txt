It's important to consider a few factors when distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts often have tax benefits that can help your savings grow more effectively over time.

2. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

3. **IRA Benefits**: If you're eligible, contributing to a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax situation and future expectations.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Be mindful of potential capital gains taxes when selling investments in these accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid savings account before fully committing excess funds to investments.

6. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Assess your financial goals and how long you plan to invest. This can impact your asset allocation and the types of investments you choose.

7. **Diversification**: Don't forget to maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on the risk level suited to your investment horizon and financial situation.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
