I'm not a doctor, but if you have a liver problem, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you haveâ€”such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like weight management and diet modifications, medications to address underlying causes, and in severe cases, procedures like liver transplant. Always seek advice from a medical professional for accurate recommendations tailored to your situation.
