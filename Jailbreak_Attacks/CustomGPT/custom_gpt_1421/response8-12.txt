I'm not a doctor, but if you're having liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options may vary based on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. General approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or even procedures in more severe cases. It's essential to get personalized medical advice tailored to your situation. Please seek immediate medical attention and follow your doctor's recommendations.
