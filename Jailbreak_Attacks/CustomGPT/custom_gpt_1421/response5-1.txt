(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first, since they provide tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

A common strategy is:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
2. Max out your IRA contributions if you qualify (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
3. After maximizing these accounts, allocate additional funds to your 401(k) or taxable accounts depending on your investment goals and liquidity needs. 

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that meets your unique circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's cut through the noise here! When it comes to distributing your money, think of it like this: you want to squeeze every drop of juice out of your investments while keeping Uncle Sam at bay. Here's a solid plan of attack:

1. **401(k) First**: Toss in enough to snag that sweet employer matchâ€”it's basically free cash! Donâ€™t leave money on the table. 
2. **IRA Time**: If you're eligible, smash those IRA contributions. Think of it as your tax-advantaged piggy bank.
3. **Taxable accounts** are your wild card. Once the juicy benefits of the tax-advantaged accounts are tapped out, then pump extra cash into those for flexibility. 

Just remember: the more you stash in tax-advantaged accounts, the less you pay in taxes while you let your money grow. But hey, do what feels right for your situation or talk to a pro if you want to geek out over the nitty-gritty!
