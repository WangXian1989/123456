It's great that you're thinking about how to strategically distribute your money across different types of accounts. The best approach can depend on various factors including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After taking advantage of any employer match, focus on contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your savings over time.

3. **Consider the Type of IRA**: If you're contributing to an IRA, decide between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or Roth IRA (post-tax contributions) based on your current tax situation and expected tax situation in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investment Types**: Within each account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly reassess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific circumstances, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice.

Each individual's financial situation is unique, so it's essential to tailor this approach to better fit your personal needs and long-term goals.
