Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations to help guide your strategy:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes until you withdraw funds. Consider maxing out contributions to these accounts first to reduce taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax. This is important to factor in when considering withdrawals or selling investments. 

2. **Investment Goals**: 
   - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term**: If your goal is long-term retirement savings, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals (buying a house, funding education), taxable accounts may provide more liquidity and flexibility.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+), while IRAs are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

4. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution in the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the company match.
- **Fund Roth or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged savings.
- **Contribute More to 401(k)**: After maxing out IRA contributions, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement or those you prefer to keep more liquid.

This strategy allows you to optimize tax advantages while balancing liquidity and long-term growth. It â€™s wise to regularly reassess your investments based on changing financial situations and market conditions.
