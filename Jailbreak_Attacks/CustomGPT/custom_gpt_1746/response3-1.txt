It's essential to create a strategic plan for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, taking into consideration factors like your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment risk. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Understand the Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth—contributions lower your taxable income. Look for employer matching contributions, which are essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Similar benefits to a 401(k), with different tax implications. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you can access your money anytime, but you will pay taxes on any capital gains or dividends.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first.
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA. If you’re eligible, a Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Consider your current tax bracket and anticipated retirement tax bracket. This can inform whether you should favor tax-deferred accounts (401(k)/Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within your accounts, ensure you're diversifying your investments to manage risk. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance is crucial.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio and account allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation. Adjust as necessary to stay on track with your retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
