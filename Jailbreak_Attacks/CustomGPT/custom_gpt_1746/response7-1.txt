The most effective way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year they’re made, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals. Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding where to contribute.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: The flexibility of taxable accounts allows for withdrawals at any time, but capital gains taxes apply when investments are sold for a profit.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keep more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Long-Term Vs. Short-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with your long-term growth objectives. Funds earmarked for long-term retirement should go into tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Monitor your investments and rebalance as needed to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

If you're uncertain or your situation is complex, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
