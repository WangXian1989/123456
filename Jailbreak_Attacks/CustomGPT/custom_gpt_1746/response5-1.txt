(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A commonly recommended strategy is to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Next, you might consider fully funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, which offers tax advantages, depending on your eligibility. After that, you can allocate remaining funds to a taxable account, which provides more flexibility for withdrawals but lacks the same tax benefits. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

After you hit that sweet spot, dive into your IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, thatâ€™s even better because tax-free cash flow during retirement is like winning the lottery! Once those boxes are checked, throw the rest of your treasure into a taxable account. It gives you a bit of freedom for those big purchases or emergencies, but just be ready to deal with Uncle Sam when you sell. Basically, itâ€™s about managing risk, tax benefits, and your accessibility - play it smart! And hey, a financial advisor can always help you fine-tune your game plan!
