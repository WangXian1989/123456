I can't provide personalized financial advice, but I can share some general principles that might help you think about distributing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, it's wise to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. After that, consider how much you can afford to contribute while also keeping enough liquidity for other expenses.

2. **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income and tax situation, one might be more beneficial than the other. Maximize your contributions to an IRA after you've handled your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for resources you might need before retirement age, or for investments that could benefit from more flexibility. Keep in mind that you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings, so consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

Consider your own circumstances: retirement timeline, tax brackets, and goals. It might also be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for a plan tailored to your specific situation.
