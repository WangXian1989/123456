The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored retirement plans that may offer matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This includes Traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions, tax-deferred growth) and Roth IRAs (after-tax contributions, tax-free growth and withdrawals). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts with no tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and Traditional IRA first to reduce taxable income. The goal is to allow those investments to grow tax-deferred until retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Roth IRA contributions should be made if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Withdrawals are tax-free if you've met the eligibility requirements.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with high turnover, as you’ll incur capital gains taxes. Also, they are suitable for funds you may need access to before retirement age.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers a limited selection of funds. Choose a mix that aligns with your risk tolerance (stocks for growth, bonds for stability).
   - **IRA**: This account usually provides more investment options, including individual stocks and ETFs. Consider a diversified portfolio that fits your long-term goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This can be more aggressive since you have flexibility. Consider investing in index funds or ETFs for diversification and lower fees.

### 5. **Age Consideration**:
   - Younger investors may prioritize Roth IRAs due to years of tax-free growth, while older individuals might focus more on Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s to stockpile tax advantages as they approach retirement.

### 6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on market performance, life changes, or shifts in financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can tailor your strategy to your unique situation, helping to optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.

### Conclusion:
By understanding the unique benefits and restrictions of each account type and considering both your current circumstances and future goals, you can create a balanced investment strategy that maximizes growth while efficiently managing tax liabilities. Always remember to adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.
