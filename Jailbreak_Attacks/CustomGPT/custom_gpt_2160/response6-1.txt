To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth and often includes employer matching contributions, making it beneficial for long-term savings.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also provides tax advantages, either through tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for shorter-term goals.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals and Timeline**:
   - **Short-Term Goals (1-5 years)**: Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Medium to Long-Term Goals (5+ years)**: Focus on 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits and growth.

### 3. **Allocate Based on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, then fund your IRA fully (if eligible).
   - **Taxable Accounts for Excess Cash**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 4. **Diversification within Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact on capital gains.

### Conclusion:
Distributing your funds effectively across these accounts can enhance your investment strategy. Ensure your allocation aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed, focusing on maximizing tax efficiency and meeting your investment objectives. 

### Call to Action:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation for the best outcomes.
