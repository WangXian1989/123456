Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations to help you make an informed decision:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions are often pre-tax, meaning you don't pay taxes on them until you withdraw funds.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to 401(k)s, traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments made here are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more liquidity and flexibility compared to retirement accounts.

### 2. **Consider Your Contribution Limits**
   - Know the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize contributions. For 2023, the limits are:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older)
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older)
   - Ensure you're utilizing any employer match in your 401(k) as it's essentially free money.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Immediate Tax Benefits**: Prioritize accounts that offer tax deductions (like traditional IRAs and 401(k)s) if you are currently in a high tax bracket.
   - **Future Tax Benefits**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors can often afford to take more risks, while those approaching retirement may want to focus on stability.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that your portfolio is diversified across all accounts to minimize risk.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Understand how withdrawals from each account will impact your tax situation.

### 6. **Rebalancing Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to the employer match + consider contributing further if in a lower tax bracket.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional investments once retirement account limits are met, focusing on long-term holdings to reduce capital gains taxes.

### Conclusion
In general, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, take advantage of employer matches, and consider your overall financial situation for an optimal distribution strategy. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
