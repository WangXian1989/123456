Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. After that, maximize your contributions to take advantage of pre-tax savings or Roth options if available.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. The tax benefits of these accounts are significant, especially if you can benefit from tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. This makes them suitable for high-income earners now, who expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can provide flexibility and liquidity. Interest and dividends are taxable in the year earned, so they might not be ideal for long-term retirement savings, but are useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that may generate higher returns and taxable income (like stocks), while using taxable accounts for those with potentially lower taxable income (like municipal bonds).

### 4. **Rebalancing and Contributions:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This may involve adjusting contributions based on performance and changing financial situations.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from your accounts in retirement. Aim to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts, to optimize tax efficiency.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances is also a wise step.
