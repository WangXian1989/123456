I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.), overall health, and other factors. Common approaches include lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplants. Please reach out to a healthcare provider for guidance tailored to your situation.
