Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially "free money." Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** These should hold investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) or tax-efficient investments (bonds might be better in tax-advantaged accounts).

3. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Consider your time horizon. If your goals are longer-term (retirement), lean towards tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, prioritize liquidity which is better served by taxable accounts.

4. **Evaluate Withdrawals and Needs:**
   - Understand when you might need access to funds. 401(k) and IRA funds typically have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Maintain Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes, regardless of account type.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed based on changes in your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation.
