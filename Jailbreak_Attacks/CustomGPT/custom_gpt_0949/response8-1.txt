Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first, as it's free money.
   - Consider contributing to the limit if you can afford it, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - The choice between a Roth and a traditional IRA often depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains tax on distributions.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) set aside before aggressively investing.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk and optimize returns.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal situations vary greatly, so consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances.

Regularly review and adjust your distribution as your financial situation and goals change. This balanced approach can help you maximize your benefits from each account type.
