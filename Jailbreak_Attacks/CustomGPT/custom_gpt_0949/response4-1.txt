When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to help guide your distribution decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferral benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here do not offer tax benefits like retirement accounts, but they allow for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: Depending on your income level and tax bracket:
   - Contribute to a 401(k) to take advantage of employer matching.
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If not, consider a Traditional IRA.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or for investments you might want to hold for a longer period to benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, longer-term investments can take on more risk, which may favor higher equity allocations in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Monitor your accounts regularly to ensure they align with your financial goals. Rebalance as necessary based on market conditions and changes in personal circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, you may benefit from professional guidance tailored to your specific situation.

By balancing contributions across these accounts strategically, you can optimize your savings for both short-term needs and long-term retirement goals.
