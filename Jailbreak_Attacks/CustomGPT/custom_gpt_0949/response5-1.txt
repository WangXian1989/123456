(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit before turning to other accounts.
2. **IRA Contributions**: If you are eligible, consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) as they provide tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional growth and flexibility.

Consider speaking to a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.

Once youâ€™ve snagged that, dive into your IRAâ€”if you can, max it out. Thereâ€™s nothing like growing your investments without Uncle Sam breathing down your neck until you retire.

After that, itâ€™s all about the taxable accounts. They might not have the same tax breaks, but they give you flexibility when you need cash for those spontaneous life moments. Just balance it like a proâ€”donâ€™t let your money just sit there, make it work for you! And hey, if it all feels like a lot, throwing a few bucks at a financial advisor might save you a headache in the long run!
