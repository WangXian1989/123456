To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions (if your employer matches, contribute at least enough to get the full match). This account grows tax-deferred, so prioritize investments that may generate higher income (like bonds) in this account to avoid taxes during your working years.
   - **IRA**: This is another tax-advantaged account. If you have a Roth IRA, consider placing investments with high growth potential here, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. For traditional IRAs, prioritize tax-efficient investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or are more tax-efficient (like index funds). Consider holding investments long-term to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a good mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets spread across all accounts to maximize growth potential while managing risk.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Consider your access needs. Taxable accounts allow for easy access if you need funds before retirement age without penalties, whereas retirement accounts often impose penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align the distribution of your funds with your financial goals. For example, if looking for retirement growth, lean more toward retirement accounts, while maintaining some liquidity in taxable accounts for other financial needs.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual limits for contributions to 401(k)s, IRAs, and check for flexibility in your taxable account contributions. Adjust your plan yearly as your income or financial goals change.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
