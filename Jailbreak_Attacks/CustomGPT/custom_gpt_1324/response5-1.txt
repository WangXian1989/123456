Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Contribute to IRAs**:
   - Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) since these accounts have less favorable tax treatment.
   - Hold investments that benefit from long-term capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Diverse Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Aiming for a tax-efficient approach will lead to better long-term growth. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
