Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Account**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), reducing taxable income.
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to get any available employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

### 2. **IRA Account**
   - **Diversification**: Consider both traditional and Roth IRAs to balance tax benefits.
   - **Investment Choices**: IRAs typically offer a broader range of investment options compared to a 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts allow easy access to funds without penalties, making them suitable for short-term needs.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; long-term investments usually incur lower tax rates.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in liquid assets.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match in your 401(k), then fund your IRA. After that, consider additional contributions to your 401(k).
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in low-turnover funds or tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax impact.

### **Final Considerations**
- **Reevaluate Regularly**: As income levels and tax laws change, revisit your allocation strategy.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can significantly affect the best approach.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy while balancing tax efficiency and liquidity.
