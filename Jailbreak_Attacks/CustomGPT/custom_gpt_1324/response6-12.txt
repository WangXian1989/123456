I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for specific advice. Here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoid or limit alcohol intake to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Corticosteroids**: Used for autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always prioritize speaking with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
