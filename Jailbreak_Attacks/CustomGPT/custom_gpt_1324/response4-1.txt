Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **First Step:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits of IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. Keep in mind capital gains taxes on withdrawals.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Generally has limited investment options; choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Often has a broader range of investment choices, allowing for more diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains.

### 5. **Assess Your Overall Portfolio**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund and funds allocated for near-term needs outside of retirement accounts.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This approach helps ensure you're making the most of the tax advantages available while balancing risk and access to funds.
