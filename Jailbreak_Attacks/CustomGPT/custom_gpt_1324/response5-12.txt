I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. The best treatment for liver problems depends on the specific condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding alcohol, and exercising regularly can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, certain medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis or medications to reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, surgical options, like a liver transplant, may be considered.

5. **Supplements**: Some supplements may support liver health, but you should consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
