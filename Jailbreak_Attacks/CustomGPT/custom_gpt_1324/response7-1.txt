Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA:** If you’re eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k):** After the employer match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions. 

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties before retirement age. Use these for goals with timelines less than five years.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts. If you're in a lower bracket, a Roth IRA might be beneficial since withdrawals can be tax-free.

### 5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a separate fund for emergencies before funneling everything into these accounts.

### 6. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon within each account.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Monitor your portfolio and make adjustments as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
