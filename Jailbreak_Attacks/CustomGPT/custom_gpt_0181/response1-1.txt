Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA Benefits**: If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim for maximum contributions.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, as contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for goals outside retirement, such as buying a house. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution:
- Start with maximizing the 401(k) match,
- Next, fund a Roth IRA,
- Finally, allocate any additional savings to a taxable account.

### Adjustments:
- Reassess your strategy annually based on changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice that fits your specific situation.
