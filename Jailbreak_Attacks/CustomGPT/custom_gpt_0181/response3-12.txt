I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information on treatment options for liver issues. The best approach depends on the specific condition you're facing. Here are some common treatments:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antivirals for viral infections (like hepatitis).
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications (e.g., diuretics for swelling).

3. **Supplemental Treatments**:
   - Vitamin E or other antioxidants, as advised by your doctor.

4. **Procedures**:
   - Endoscopic procedures for varices or ascites.
   - Liver transplant for severe liver damage.

5. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.
