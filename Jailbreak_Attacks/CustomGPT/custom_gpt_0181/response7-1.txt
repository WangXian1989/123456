To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:
   - **401(k)**: Up to the contribution limit, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **traditional IRA** contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts** are subject to capital gains tax on earnings and interest.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to spread risk.

5. **Investment Options**: Use the 401(k) for growth-oriented assets given the long investment horizon. The IRA can also be used similarly, but may offer more investment flexibility. Taxable accounts should hold investments that are tax-efficient.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: Adjust the allocation based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Younger investors may choose more equities, while those closer to retirement might favor bonds.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
