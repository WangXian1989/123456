To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before investing heavily. It often provides a better return than investments.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: After 401(k) contributions, consider funding an IRA (either traditional or Roth). IRAs can offer tax advantages, especially if you plan to withdraw in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement, or for assets that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to help manage risk. This might mean holding different asset classes or investment types in each account.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Choose investments for your taxable accounts that are more tax-efficient. For instance, municipal bonds are often tax-free at the federal level and may be a good option.

7. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance and any changes in your financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
