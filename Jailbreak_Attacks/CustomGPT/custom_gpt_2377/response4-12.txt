I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem. They can provide you with personal advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or possibly procedures, depending on the severity and type of liver issue you have. It's best to get a diagnosis from a medical expert.
