The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Max out your contributions if possible, as 401(k) plans often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, depending on your income level, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed enough to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility, as you can access your money anytime without penalties. However, be mindful of tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk and potential returns. Adjust your asset allocation based on your time horizon and risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Keep in mind the tax implications for each account type. Tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs can help grow your investments tax-deferred or tax-free, while taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation.
