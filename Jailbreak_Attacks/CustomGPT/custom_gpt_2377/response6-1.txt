To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to meet any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If feasible, aim to contribute the maximum limit allowed ($22,500 for 2023).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide upfront tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts: Use these for short-term goals or to hold investments that may be taxed favorably, like long-term capital gains. 
   - Prioritize high-interest debt payments before maximizing taxable investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a variety of asset types in each account. For instance, hold bonds in your taxable account if they generate interest that would be taxed at your ordinary rate.
   - Use tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach tailored to your financial goals and tax situation.
