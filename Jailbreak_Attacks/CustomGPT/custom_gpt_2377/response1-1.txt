When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, also tax-deferred, but with different contribution limits and rules.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on gains and dividends in the year they’re realized.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement, as they offer more flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio has a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations as investments grow and adjust to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Assess Your Needs**: Consider your timeline, risk tolerance, and retirement goals when determining the distribution.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, getting personalized advice can help tailor a plan to fit your specific situation.

Doing this can help you build a well-rounded financial strategy for the future.
