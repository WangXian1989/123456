Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Fund your IRA or Roth IRA (if you qualify), as these offer tax benefits that can accelerate growth.
   - Next, max out your 401(k) contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need before retirement or for investment flexibility.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse investment portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate cash reserves in a savings account for emergencies, generally 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

6. **Continuous Review**: Regularly review your allocation based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
