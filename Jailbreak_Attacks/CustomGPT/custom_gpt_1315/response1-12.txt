I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver issues typically depend on the specific condition. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains), quitting alcohol, and exercising regularly can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition are crucial.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be discussed.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.
