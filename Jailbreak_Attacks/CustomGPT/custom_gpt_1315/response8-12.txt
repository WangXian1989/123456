2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may include antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery:** 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Support:**
