Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional investments once you maximize tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) & Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any capital gains are taxed when realized. Use these accounts for investments you might want to access earlier without penalties.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) & IRAs:** Focus on long-term growth through diversified investments, considering your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Keep your asset allocation in line with your goals and risk tolerance. This may mean moving funds between accounts as necessary.

### 5. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Decide how much to save for retirement vs. other short-term goals, and adjust your contributions accordingly.

### Conclusion:
An optimal strategy balances maximizing tax-advantaged options first while considering your current and future tax implications. Consulting a financial advisor can tailor a plan to your specific situation.
