Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any company matchâ€”it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

2. **Balance Risk and Liquidity**:
   - Future needs or emergencies should be factored into how much you keep in taxable accounts, as these offer more liquidity.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains, while retirement accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Prioritize growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts if you have a long time horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep enough in a savings account or a taxable account for 3-6 months of expenses to cover emergencies.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds) and consider bonds or stable assets in taxable accounts for reduced volatility.

Balancing these areas while regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategy can help optimize your investments over time. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
