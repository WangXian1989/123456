To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
    - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
    - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, benefits you in the long run.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place that's easily accessible in a separate savings account.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your allocation based on your age, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Younger individuals can typically handle more risk.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consider seeking professional advice to create a tailored strategy.

Following these steps will help you optimize your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for growth and tax efficiency.
