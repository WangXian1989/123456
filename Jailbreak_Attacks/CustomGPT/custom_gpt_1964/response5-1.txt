Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide if you want to contribute pre-tax (traditional) for immediate tax benefits or post-tax (Roth) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA gives you tax deductions now but taxes withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribute to the Maximum Limit**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible, since they offer tax advantages.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest After Maxing Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Use taxable accounts to invest any additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - **Focus on Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Aim for employer match, then up to the maximum allowed.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions, opting for Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining disposable income can be invested in taxable accounts using a diversified approach.

### Additional Considerations
- **Financial Goals**: Adjust based on short-term needs (like a house purchase) versus long-term retirement.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across these accounts based on performance and changing goals.
