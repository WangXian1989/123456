Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Understand the benefits of tax-deferred growth and high contribution limits (up to $20,500 in 2023, or $27,000 if you're over 50).
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k).

### 2. **IRAs**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). A Roth may be preferable for younger investors who anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Note the contribution limit is $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs generally offer a broader selection of investments than 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, ideal for goals such as buying a home or travel.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of capital gains taxes and the impact of dividends. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or using tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund before investing.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across accounts are diversified to minimize risk.
- **Regular Contributions**: Automate contributions to maximize growth through dollar-cost averaging.
- **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.

Balancing the contributions among these accounts can optimize your retirement savings while considering tax implications and personal financial goals.
