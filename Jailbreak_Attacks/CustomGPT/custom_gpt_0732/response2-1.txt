Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages can be significant, especially if you qualify for tax deductions or tax-free growth.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now. Taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold, and dividends are taxed as ordinary income.

4. **Balance Contributions Based on Income**: If you're in a high tax bracket, focus more on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for immediate tax savings. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

5. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: If youâ€™re investing for the long-term (e.g., retirement), prioritize accounts that offer tax advantages. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may be more suitable for liquidity.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio (across all accounts) is well-diversified to mitigate risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and investment choices. Adjust contributions as your income, expenses, and goals evolve.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
