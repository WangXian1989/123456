Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This is often a priority for pre-tax contributions, providing immediate tax benefits. Consider the fees and investment options.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Fill in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider your taxable investment accounts. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals and potentially lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - For tax-advantaged accounts, you might hold more aggressive investments since these accounts are designed for long-term growth.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, plan withdrawal strategies that could minimize taxes, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first to delay withdrawal from tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investments according to your risk tolerance, changes in financial goals, and market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal situation and ensure you're adhering to tax laws.
