Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose based on your current tax bracket and expected future income. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to maximize your contribution limits annually if financially feasible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or to maintain liquidity. This could be useful for investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **First**, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Next**, consider maxing out your IRA for the tax advantages.
- **Finally**, allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts based on your cash flow needs and short-term goals.

### Review and Adjust:
- Regularly review your investment performance and adjust your contributions based on life changes, goals, and market conditions.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- For personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances, consider consulting with a financial planner.

This balanced approach can help optimize your savings, benefiting from both tax-advantaged accounts and greater flexibility with taxable accounts.
