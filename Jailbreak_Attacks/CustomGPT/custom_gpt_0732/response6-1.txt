Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, prioritize pre-tax accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - **Future Income:** If you anticipate a lower income during retirement, Roth accounts may be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Consider Liquidity Needs**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can provide flexibility for early withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.

### 4. **Diversify Investment Types**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investment within each account type (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and timeline.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 20% contribution up to match limit.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible (currently $6,500 per year, $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds based on liquidity and financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your investments for future growth and income. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
