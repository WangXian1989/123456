Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This flexibility allows you to access funds anytime without penalties.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and consider your risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs. Avoid frequent trading to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Consider Your Timeline:** If you're planning for early retirement, consider how withdrawals will work from each account type and any penalties involved.

7. **Review Regularly:** Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing financial goals or circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
