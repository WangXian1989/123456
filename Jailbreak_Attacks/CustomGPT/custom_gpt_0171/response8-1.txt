To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions here, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Contributions can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, as they are taxed differently.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Consider putting more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep safer, more liquid investments in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will draw from these accounts in retirement to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Financial Goals**:
   - Consider your specific goals (retirement, emergencies, etc.) and adjust your contributions accordingly.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
