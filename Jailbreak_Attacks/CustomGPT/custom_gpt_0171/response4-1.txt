Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.
   - **401(k)**: Aim to maximize contributions up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024; $30,000 if you're over 50). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for goals that are shorter term or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider holding investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and financial goals. Stocks for long-term growth, bonds for stability, and cash for liquidity.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your distribution remains aligned with your goals and adjust as necessary.
