To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now. Focus on this if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth. Choose traditional IRAs for potential tax deductions.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account, based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Consider putting more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts for better long-term growth.

4. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Consider holding investments with lower turnover (like ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a specific plan based on your financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals.

By strategically balancing your contributions and taking advantage of the benefits each type of account offers, you can optimize your savings for retirement.
