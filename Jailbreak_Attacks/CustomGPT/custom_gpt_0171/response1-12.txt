I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems depend on the underlying condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Limit Alcohol**: Reduce or eliminate alcohol intake.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight can help fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, cirrhosis, or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Follow-up appointments and tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Minimize exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications and chemicals.

5. **Supportive Therapies**: 
   - In cases like hepatitis, antiviral medications may be effective.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
