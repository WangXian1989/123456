To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This reduces taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, depending on your income level.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for easier access.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Diversification**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for an optimal withdrawal strategy in retirement to minimize taxes, considering when and how to draw from each account type.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Re-assess your portfolio regularly to align with changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Sample Distribution Approach
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to leverage employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation (e.g., younger individuals may benefit more from Roth).
- **Taxable**: Invest remaining funds for flexibility and emergencies.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation, ensuring that tax implications and personal goals are fully considered.
