I'm not able to provide medical advice, but I can share some common treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized care.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fats, high in fruits and vegetables)
   - Regular exercise
   - Weight management

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis
   - Supplements for liver support (consult your doctor first)

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Abstaining from alcohol can significantly help liver function.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver health.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant might be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to discuss the best treatment options for your specific condition.
