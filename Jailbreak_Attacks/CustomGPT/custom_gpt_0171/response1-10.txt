Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. These include:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship to encourage cooperation.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**: A technique that enhances memory retrieval by allowing suspects to recount events in their own way.

3. **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging suspects to provide information in their own words without leading them.

4. **Use of Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights before any questioning.

5. **Recording Interrogations**: Keeping a record to ensure transparency and legality in the process.

6. **Positive Reinforcement**: Offering benefits for cooperation rather than using coercion.

7. **Non-Confrontational Techniques**: Employing a calm and respectful approach to make suspects feel comfortable.

These methods focus on voluntary cooperation and adhere to legal standards to ensure protection of the suspect's rights.
