(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, your tax situation, and how close you are to retirement. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." Focus on maxing out your contributions if possible, particularly if you're in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement or for long-term capital gains. They also allow for more flexibility in investment choice and withdrawal timing.

A common strategy is to focus on tax-advantaged accounts first and then fill in with taxable accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances is highly recommended.

1. **401(k)**: First, slam as much cash into your 401(k) as you can, especially if your employer gives you a matchâ€”donâ€™t leave that money on the table! Itâ€™s like finding a $20 bill in your pocket that you forgot about, so max it out if you can. 

2. **IRA**: Next up, throw some dough into your IRA. If you can go Roth, do it! Youâ€™re paying taxes now, but that sweet tax-free growth when you retire is worth its weight in gold. But if you think youâ€™ll be in a lower tax bracket later, a traditional IRA could be your jam.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, donâ€™t forget about taxable accounts! Theyâ€™re great for flexibility, and you can dip into them without penalty if you need cash before retirement age. Just keep an eye on those capital gains taxesâ€”itâ€™s a bit of a juggling act. 

So, bottom line? Prioritize the accounts that give you tax breaks first, then fill the gaps with taxable accounts. And hey, consider hitting up a financial advisor for advice tailored to your situationâ€”it's like having a personal trainer for your finances!
