To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be pre-tax or after-tax (Roth), depending on your plan. Aim to contribute enough to maximize any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth. Consider your current versus expected future tax situation when deciding between the two.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they lack tax advantages, they provide flexibility. Capital gains and dividend taxes apply here, so use this for investments that generate long-term growth.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate based on your investment goals. Retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) should focus on long-term growth, while taxable accounts can accommodate short-term needs or more liquid funds.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Invest in a well-diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and age. Generally, younger investors can take more risk.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax burden.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s ($22,500 for 2023, plus $7,500 catch-up if 50 or older) and IRAs ($6,500 for 2023, plus $1,000 catch-up). Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before funding taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Funds in IRAs and 401(k)s have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawal. Taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

**Example Strategy**:
- Max out any employer match in the 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you qualify.
- Fund the taxable account with any extra savings after the above contributions.

This approach generally balances tax benefits while providing growth potential and liquidity. However, it's essential to tailor your strategy based on personal financial circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights.
