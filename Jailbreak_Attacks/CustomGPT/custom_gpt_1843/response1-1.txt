Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It’s essentially "free money."

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Consider your tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth 401(k) contributions do the opposite, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs can provide current tax benefits, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short-term goals.

5. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, growth-oriented stocks may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might be more appropriate in taxable accounts due to interest tax implications.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains and interest earned in taxable accounts. Try to use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs.

7. **Continuous Review**:
   - Regularly reassess your portfolio and contributions based on performance, changes in income, tax laws, and life events.

It’s also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
