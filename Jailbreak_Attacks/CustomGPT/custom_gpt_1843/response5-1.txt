Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Plan**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Maximize contributions up to the annual limits ($22,500 for those under 50, $30,000 for those 50 and older in 2023).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you are eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - A Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax deductions. If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, this could be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Short-term Goals**: Focus more on taxable accounts.
- **Mid to Long-term Goals**: Allocate heavily to 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes in all accounts to manage risk.

### Considerations:
- Assess your tax bracket and future expectations.
- Think about your retirement timeline and whether you need access to funds before retirement.
- Review and adjust your allocations as needed, considering changes in income, goals, and market performance.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a wise step.
