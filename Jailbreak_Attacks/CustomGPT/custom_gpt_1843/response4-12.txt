2. **Dietary Changes**: 
   - Adopting a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting sugar, saturated fats, and processed foods.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - **Alcohol cessation**: Stop drinking alcohol to prevent further liver damage.
   - **Weight management**: Losing weight can reverse fatty liver disease.
   - Regular exercise to improve overall health.

4. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver biopsy** to assess damage and determine the appropriate treatment.

6. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and adjust treatments as needed.
