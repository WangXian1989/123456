Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax strategy and enhance your retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before maximizing retirement contributions.

### 3. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - If eligible, prioritize maxing out IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.

### 4. **Contribute to 401(k) Beyond Match**
   - After funding your IRA, direct additional savings into your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit, if you still have room in your budget.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This provides flexibility for early withdrawals or specific financial goals, though you'll pay capital gains tax on profits.

### 6. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, riskier investments (like stocks) would be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts since they benefit from tax deferral.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Your financial situation and tax laws may change, so review your strategy regularly, ideally aligning it with a financial advisor.

### Final Tip
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation, including income level, expenses, and retirement goals.
