To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions if your financial situation allows.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your savings.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize them for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as these will be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This can include stocks or equity funds that you plan to hold long-term.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts align with your overall risk tolerance. For instance, you may choose to allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your taxable accounts while keeping more conservative choices (like bonds) in tax-advantaged settings.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**
   - As you get closer to retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. Generally, drawing down from taxable accounts first can be advantageous.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure you stay aligned with your investment goals.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while also managing for growth and risk across all accounts, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy.
