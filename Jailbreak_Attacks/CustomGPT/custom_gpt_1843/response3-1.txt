Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions ($22,500 for those under 50, or $30,000 if 50+ in 2023).

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Open an IRA**: Consider opening a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribute Up to the Maximum**: You can contribute $6,500 ($7,500 if 50+) to an IRA. This helps to diversify your tax strategy.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **After Tax Investments**: Use these for investments that could grow but may not be suitable for retirement accounts due to potential penalties or access issues.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on index funds, ETFs, or municipal bonds to minimize tax impacts in these accounts.

### 4. **Considerations**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place (3-6 months of living expenses) before heavily investing.
   - **Diversification**: Aim to diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust distributions periodically based on market conditions and personal financial changes.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the nuances of personal finance, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

By carefully evaluating your contributions to each type of account based on your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy.
