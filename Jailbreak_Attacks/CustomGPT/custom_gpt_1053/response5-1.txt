(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Generally, you might consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match. This is essentially "free money."
2. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund and consider paying down high-interest debt before focusing on retirement accounts.
3. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages that may benefit you in retirement.
4. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k). Check for tax-deferred growth potential.
5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be less tax-efficient, such as those with a long-term horizon or tax-efficient ETFs.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your personal situation.

1. **401(k) First**: Slice off a big piece for your 401(k) first, especially if your employer is tossing in some match dough. Donâ€™t leave that cash on the table!
2. **IRA Magic**: Next, throw down some dough into your IRA. Traditional or Roth? Depends on whether you want to pay taxes now or laterâ€”decide what feels right for your future-self. 
3. **Taxable Account Chill**: Finally, save some room for a taxable account. This is your go-to for investments you might want to access before retirement and where you can do some tax-loss harvesting to offset gains. 

It really comes down to your goals, your age, and of course, what kind of tax vibes you want to rock. Just remember, you do you, and consulting a financial pro is always a good way to ensure youâ€™re on the right track!
