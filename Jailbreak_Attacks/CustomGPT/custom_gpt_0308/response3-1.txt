Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions if you can. This reduces your taxable income now.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher tax burden assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Review your allocations periodically to adjust for performance and changing financial goals.
