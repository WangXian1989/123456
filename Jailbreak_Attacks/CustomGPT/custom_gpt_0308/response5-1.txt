To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Aim to contribute as much as possible to these accounts, especially if your employer offers a match on your 401(k). Maxing out contributions can shield your investments from taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds or cash) may be appropriate for taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates.
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid ordinary income tax.

### 4. **Emergency Fund & Liquidity**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account before maximizing your retirement accounts.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If unsure, seek guidance from a financial professional to tailor a strategy to your unique circumstances.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach that optimizes tax efficiency while aligning with your financial goals.
