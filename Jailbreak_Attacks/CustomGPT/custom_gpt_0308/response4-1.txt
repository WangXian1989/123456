Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your IRA and 401(k) due to tax-deferred growth.
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity (3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to benefit from compounding.
   - Consider placing bonds and other income-generating investments in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: In retirement, plan withdrawals strategically:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from your 401(k) and IRA.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across sectors and asset classes to balance risk and return.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
