Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects without violating their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment for the suspect to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and have legal counsel present before any interrogation begins.

3. **Evidence Presentation**: Presenting credible evidence that prompts suspects to reconsider their positions and cooperate.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using open-ended questions and encouraging detailed responses to help suspects recall information without coercion.

5. **Incentives for Cooperation**: Offering plea deals or reduced sentences in exchange for truthful information, maintaining compliance with legal standards.

6. **Surveillance and Forensic Evidence**: Collecting and presenting physical evidence that may lead suspects to provide information without direct questioning.

7. **Non-Coercive Techniques**: Engaging in non-aggressive questioning, avoiding threats or intimidation.

These methods respect the rights of suspects while allowing law enforcement to gather information effectively.
