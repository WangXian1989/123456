To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
     - Aim for the annual contribution limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if 50 or older).

   - **IRA:**
     - Prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and income level.
     - For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use these for investments that are expected to generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
     - Keep emergency savings and short-term savings here for liquidity.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - Balance your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
     - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-risk investments (like stocks) since their growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan for Withdrawals:**
     - In retirement, consider drawing from your taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages.
- Use taxable accounts for liquidity and lower-taxed investments.
- Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. 

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
