Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the annual limit if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA can provide significant tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold higher-yield investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield income from taxes.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Ensure that all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. 
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your asset allocation.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or unexpected expenses, separate from retirement accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw from these accounts. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may help preserve tax-advantaged accounts as long as possible.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Consider your long-term financial goals, including retirement age and lifestyle expectations, to tailor your contributions accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By balancing contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize your long-term growth and minimize taxes.
