Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). The choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are good for funds you might need before retirement. Investments in these accounts should focus on tax-efficient strategies (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversify between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your strategy.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Professional**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your situation.

This approach will help you balance growth potential with tax efficiency over time.
