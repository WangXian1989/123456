Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k), Traditional IRA): Ideal for long-term growth as you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for conservative investments (like bonds) for better tax treatment on dividends and interest.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and growth.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your strategy periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
