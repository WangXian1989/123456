I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the condition, medications can help manage symptoms or reduce liver inflammation.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in fat and sugar can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Alcohol Reduction**: For alcohol-related liver issues, cutting back or quitting alcohol is crucial.

4. **Managing Conditions**: Treating underlying conditions, like diabetes or hepatitis, can improve liver function.

5. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups can help monitor liver health and detect any changes early.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be needed, including liver transplants.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized recommendations and treatment options.
