Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Your 401(k) and IRA are primarily for retirement.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Taxable accounts are better for short-term goals due to easier access to funds.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out your employer match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed annually. Consider high-dividend or interest-yielding assets carefully.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - Utilize your employer match in your 401(k) before contributing to your IRA.

### 4. **Investment Horizon**
   - Longer timelines can afford more risk (e.g., stocks in tax-advantaged accounts).
   - Shorter timelines might require more conservative investments.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: First allocate funds to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to an IRA next, especially if you qualify for Roth benefits.
3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing the IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k).
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on investments that limit tax exposure, like index funds.

### Monitor and Adjust
Regularly review your distribution and adjust based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax legislation.
