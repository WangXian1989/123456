To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit. Focus on pre-tax contributions to lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After your 401(k), contribute to an IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments with a lower expected return, as capital gains taxes apply. Consider placing bonds or less tax-efficient investments here.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments across accounts:
   - **401(k):** Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA:** Use for growth-oriented investments, particularly if itâ€™s a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep liquid, lower-risk investments, or those you may need to access in the near term.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changing market conditions and personal financial goals.

6. **Long-Term Focus:** Stay invested for the long term while taking advantage of specific features of each account type.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.
