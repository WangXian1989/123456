Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). IRAs often have more investment options than 401(k)s.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - Once you've fully funded your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if it offers tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts:**
   - If you have excess funds after contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you want more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. For example, hold more growth-oriented assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

### 6. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Be mindful of how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Generally, pull from taxable accounts first for short-term needs to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation or retirement goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances.
