To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. 
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment time horizon when allocating assets across these accounts. Young investors might lean towards growth-oriented investments, while those nearing retirement may prefer more stable options.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, ensuring you are not overexposed to any particular investment.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help your tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best allocation for your specific situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial goals and circumstances.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can create a strategy that helps you grow your wealth efficiently.
