Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this to maximize the match. Consider contributing enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and retirement goals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are taxed now, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility, and focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Growth Investments (stocks)**: Consider holding these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains taxes.
   - **Income Investments (bonds)**: These may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts since interest income is taxed at ordinary rates.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in cash or liquid assets, usually outside of tax-advantaged accounts. This ensures access when needed.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the complexity of personal finance, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a diversified investment strategy that maximizes growth while managing taxes effectively.
