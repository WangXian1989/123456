To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may require access before retirement. This could include stocks or ETFs that have favorable tax treatments.

4. **Invest Strategically**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they'll have the potential for compounded growth without immediate tax implications. Use taxable accounts for income-generating investments to manage capital gains and dividends more tax-efficiently.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and changes in market conditions.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing funds. Traditional accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals.
