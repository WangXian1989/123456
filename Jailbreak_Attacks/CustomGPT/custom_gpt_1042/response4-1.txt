Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax and income tax on dividends, so keep tax efficiency in mind.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund separate from these accounts before investing heavily.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Your risk tolerance and investment horizon should influence your allocation. Long-term, tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs might hold more volatile assets since you won't need to access the funds for many years. Conversely, more stable investments might be suited for taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities from capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Distributing your investments across these accounts can enhance diversification and reduce risk. Consider holding different asset classes in each account according to their tax implications and your overall strategy.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account to maximize your savings. 

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique circumstances and goals.
