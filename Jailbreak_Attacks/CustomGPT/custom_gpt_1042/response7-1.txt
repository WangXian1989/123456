Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - First, ensure you're taking full advantage of any employer match in your 401(k). It’s essentially free money and should be prioritized.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full company match. If you're eligible, consider contributing the maximum amount allowed to enjoy the tax benefits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Once you’ve handled your 401(k) contributions, consider funding an IRA. A Roth IRA is often beneficial for younger individuals or those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After exhausting contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but come with different tax implications, especially on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks can be held in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while more stable investments might be placed in taxable accounts due to their tax treatment.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your investment performance and asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions. 

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

This approach aims to balance tax efficiency with growth potential while ensuring you're leveraging all available contributions and benefits.
