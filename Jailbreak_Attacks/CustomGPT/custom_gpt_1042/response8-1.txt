Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then maximize your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income eligibility.

2. **Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts. This strategy offers flexibility in retirement when withdrawing funds.

3. **Invest According to Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re younger and have a long time until retirement, consider more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA. For shorter-term goals or money you might need sooner, keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Location**: Place investments that generate higher ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes. Investments with lower tax implications (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains) can be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By balancing your contributions and investments across these account types, you can optimize growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
