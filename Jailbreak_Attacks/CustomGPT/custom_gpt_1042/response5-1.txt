(üîíNormal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA for retirement savings, as they offer tax benefits. 

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's free money. Then, consider maxing out your workplace retirement plan contributions if you can.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA for additional tax advantages. The choice between the two often depends on your current versus expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility for both short-term and long-term goals, although they don't have the same tax benefits.

It's important to regularly review your investments and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
