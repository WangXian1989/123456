Distributing your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine the best strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: 401(k) plans typically allow for higher contribution limits than IRAs. Maximize contributions if you can.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversity in Investment Options**: IRAs often offer a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans, allowing for more personalized asset allocation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalty, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors might lean heavier towards equities, while those closer to retirement may prefer conservative investments.
   - Consider your overall tax situation. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts can help offset additional tax liabilities.
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset distribution still aligns with your financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial planner can help tailor a strategy that considers your unique situation, providing a comprehensive approach to managing and distributing your funds.

Always keep your long-term goals in mind, and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
