Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if you can, as this reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, whereas a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions on your contributions, depending on your income.

2. **Evaluate Your Taxable Accounts**:
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies since these accounts offer flexibility in withdrawals. Investments in taxable accounts should focus on tax-efficient assets, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - The type of investments you hold in these accounts can be strategic. For example, place bonds (which are taxed at regular income rates) in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks (which may benefit from lower capital gains taxes) in taxable accounts for long-term growth.

4. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly reassess your investment strategy as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement. This might involve rebalancing your portfolio or adjusting your contributions based on performance and tax implications.

Itâ€™s wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and to ensure you are making the most of your tax-advantaged accounts.
