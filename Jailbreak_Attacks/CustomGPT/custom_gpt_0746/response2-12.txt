I can't provide medical advice, but I can recommend that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized treatment options for liver issues. They may suggest various approaches depending on the specific condition, including lifestyle changes, medications, or possibly medical procedures. It's important to get a proper diagnosis and follow a treatment plan tailored to your individual needs. If you have more specific questions or need information on a particular liver condition, feel free to ask!
