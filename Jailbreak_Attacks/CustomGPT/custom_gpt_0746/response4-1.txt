Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA Advantages**: If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Tax Deduction**: A traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits; however, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility with withdrawals without penalties, but be aware of capital gains taxes.
   - **Investment Choices**: You can invest in a wider variety of assets. Consider using these accounts for investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income to minimize taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions** to harness the employer match and pre-tax benefits.
2. **Allocate funds** to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you qualify for tax-free withdrawals.
3. **Invest surplus funds** in a taxable account to maintain flexibility and access while managing capital gains strategically.

### Review Regularly:
- Adjust your strategy based on changing circumstances, market conditions, and tax laws. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor tailored specifically to your individual situation.
