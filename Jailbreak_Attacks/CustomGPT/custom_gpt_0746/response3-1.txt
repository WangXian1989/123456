Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 (for 2024) plus a catch-up of $7,500 if over 50.
     - **IRA:** $6,500 (for 2024) plus a catch-up of $1,000 if over 50.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal. Consider these for higher income years.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are subject to capital gains tax. Use these for investments you plan to hold long-term, as they may benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### 4. **Investment Options**
   - **401(k):** Typically limited to employer's chosen investment options. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** More investment choices compared to 401(k). Diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for investments with high potential returns or those needing liquidity (e.g., real estate, stocks).

### 5. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon**
   - Assess how much risk you’re willing to take and your time horizon for each account:
     - Long-term investments can be more aggressive.
     - Use more conservative investments if funds are needed within a few years.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Review your asset allocation regularly and adjust based on market changes, evolving financial goals, and life circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match, then consider contributing 15-20% of your salary.
- **IRA:** If you meet income eligibility, contribute the maximum allowable amount to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
Prioritize contributions based on tax advantages and growth potential, regularly reassess your strategy, and consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.

This approach balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and liquidity based on your individual circumstances.
