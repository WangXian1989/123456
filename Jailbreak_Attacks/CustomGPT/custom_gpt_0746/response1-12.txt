I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment often depends on the specific condition. Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Alcohol reduction, a healthy diet, and regular exercise.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the cause, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
