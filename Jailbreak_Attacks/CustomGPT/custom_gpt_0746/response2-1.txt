The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income for the year, benefiting you now if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). A Roth is usually better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older for IRAs as of 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and do not have contribution limits.
   - **Investment Choices**: You can invest in various assets, but be mindful of tax implications related to capital gains.

### 4. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs before taxable accounts.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified mix (stocks, bonds, ETFs) according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Consider Time Horizon**: For long-term goals, riskier investments may be appropriate. For short-term goals, prioritize safer investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific circumstances, such as your income, expenses, retirement goals, and market conditions.

### Summary
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the full employer match.
2. Max out IRA contributions next (choose traditional or Roth based on your situation).
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility.

Adjust the percentages based on your individual situation, keeping in mind factors like tax implications and retirement goals.
