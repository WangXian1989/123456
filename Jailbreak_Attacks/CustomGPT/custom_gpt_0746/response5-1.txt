(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. If you're under 50, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. If you're over 50, consider catching up on contributions.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals with short- to medium-term horizons. Taxable accounts can also be useful for investing in tax-efficient funds or income-generating assets, which can help manage tax implications.

Ultimately, it's best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

1. **Max Your 401(k)**: First off, get that employer match! Itâ€™s like free cashâ€”do not leave that on the table. Go for the max contribution if you can swing it. For the under-50 crowd, thatâ€™s $22,500 a year (as of 2023). Hitting 50? Boomâ€”catch-up contributions of $7,500!

2. **Make the IRA Work for You**: If youâ€™ve got the option, throw some cash into a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later! Itâ€™s a no-brainer if you think your tax rate will be higher down the line. Traditional IRAs are great too if you want those tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Donâ€™t neglect these! Theyâ€™re your go-to for shorter-term goals and can be awesome for investments with favorable taxation like long-term capital gains. Just keep an eye on those taxes! 

In the end, mix it up based on your goals, and maybe talk to a financial guru to get that custom plan. Youâ€™ve got this!
