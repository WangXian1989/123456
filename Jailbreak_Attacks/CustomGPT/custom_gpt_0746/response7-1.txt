Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach it:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're 50 or older). Try to contribute enough to hit this limit if possible.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional vs. Roth:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes upon withdrawal. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribute to Max Limit:** The limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Taxable accounts offer flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties, but they come with tax implications on capital gains.
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Options:** Consider tax-efficient funds (like index funds) which generally have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to get employer matching. Follow this by contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional depending on your situation).
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, diversify with taxable investments for liquidity and flexibility.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your asset allocation periodically based on your investment performance and market conditions.

### **Final Thoughts:**
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation, considering your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
