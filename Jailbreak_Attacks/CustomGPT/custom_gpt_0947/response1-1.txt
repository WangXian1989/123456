The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k):**
   - Take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing enough to get the full match, then evaluate if you should contribute more based on your overall strategy.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - If you qualify, max out your contributions to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, as it offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - Use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or if you want access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure your investment allocation reflects your risk tolerance and timeline. Stocks might be good for growth while bonds can provide stability.

5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Be mindful of taxes on capital gains in taxable accounts. Consider holding investments for the long term to minimize tax implications.

6. **Periodic Review:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals as you progress toward retirement.

Remember, these are general guidelines, and it's crucial to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is always a good idea.
