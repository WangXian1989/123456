When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account a few key factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you can contribute to both a traditional and a Roth IRA, assess your current tax bracket and expected future income to determine which may be more beneficial.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on utilizing tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs) to grow your investments without immediate tax consequences.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable gains (e.g., long-term investments or tax-efficient funds) as you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - If you are close to retirement, prioritize more stable investments in your 401(k) and IRA to protect your capital.
   - If you have a longer time horizon, consider investing more aggressively in taxable accounts, where you can realize gains over time without immediate tax implications.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation reflects your overall investment strategy across all accounts while considering the different tax treatments of each.

It's advisable to review your distribution and investment strategy periodically to align it with changing financial goals and market conditions. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor will provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
