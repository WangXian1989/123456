When determining the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions. The choice depends on your current tax situation and expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Debt Repayment:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before maximizing retirement contributions, as the interest can outweigh the benefits of investing.

4. **Tax-Considerate Investment:** For your taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, and use tax-efficient investment strategies.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investment across accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth-oriented investments where the tax benefits are maximized.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Funds from taxable accounts may be accessed without penalty prior to age 59Â½, whereas retirement accounts have restrictions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice, consult a financial advisor who can help you align your investments with your long-term goals.
