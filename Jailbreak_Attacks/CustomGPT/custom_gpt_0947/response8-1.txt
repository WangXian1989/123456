When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Tax Implications:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are taxed as capital gains, but you have more flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Debt Considerations:** Pay off high-interest debt before focusing on investments, as the interest rates on debt can outpace potential investment returns.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. In 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

7. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering the tax implications and your income needs.

8. **Review Regularly:** Keep reviewing and adjusting your investments based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

For specific recommendations tailored to your situation, consulting a financial advisor would be highly beneficial.
