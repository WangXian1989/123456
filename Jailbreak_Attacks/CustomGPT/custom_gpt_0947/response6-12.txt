1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet Modification:** A well-balanced diet low in fat and sugar can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Drugs:** These may be prescribed for viral infections like Hepatitis B or C.
   - **Corticosteroids:** Could be used for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Routine Check-ups:** Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.
   - **Imaging Tests:** Such as ultrasound or MRI, to assess liver condition.

4. **Surgical Options:**
