The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for investments. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next. Consider whether a Roth IRA or traditional IRA is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), focus on long-term growth investments (like stocks) since these accounts are meant for retirement. 
   - In your taxable account, consider holding investments that generate either qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are generally taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you are currently in a lower tax bracket, you might benefit from Roth contributions (which are taxed now) instead of traditional contributions (which are taxed later).
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize pre-tax contributions to reduce taxable income now.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investment allocations periodically and rebalance as necessary to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it may be tax-efficient to withdraw from your taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-exempt accounts like Roth IRAs.

Each financial situation is unique, so it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
