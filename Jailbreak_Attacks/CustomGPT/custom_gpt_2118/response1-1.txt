When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, focus on funding your IRA. Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals (subject to certain conditions).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, 401(k) contributions can be up to $22,500 (or $30,000 for those 50 and older), while IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you might choose to contribute to a Roth IRA (after-tax) instead of a traditional IRA (pre-tax), if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.

5. **Diversify with Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility and no contribution limits, but you’ll owe taxes on earnings annually.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, you might allocate different types of investments to different accounts. For example, you might place higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) and hold more stable investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Monitor your investments regularly and rebalance your portfolio as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific needs and goals.
