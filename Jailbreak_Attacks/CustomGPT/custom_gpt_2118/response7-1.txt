Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match before contributing to other accounts.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRAs: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. Consider contributing here once you've maximized the match in your 401(k).
   - Taxable accounts: These can hold various investments but are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell them. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be beneficial for short-term goals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Prioritize Accounts by Timeframe**:
   - Short-term goals (within 5 years): Consider a taxable account for easier access to funds without penalties.
   - Medium to long-term goals: Focus on maximizing retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) which can aid in long-term growth and tax advantages.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation as needed based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your goals.
