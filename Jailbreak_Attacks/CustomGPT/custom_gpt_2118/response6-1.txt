When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the optimal strategy often involves several key considerations about your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to capture the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if qualified, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

2. **Balance Contributions for Flexibility:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may be subject to lower capital gains tax rates, or for funds you might need access to before retirement age.

3. **Consider Timing and Withdrawals:**
   - Plan based on when you anticipate needing access to your funds. Penalties for early withdrawal from retirement accounts can be significant.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may be preferable in a tax-advantaged account for long-term growth, while more stable investments can be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Ongoing Review:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your income, expenses, or financial goals change.

By thoughtfully distributing your contributions across these accounts, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing your tax liabilities over the long run.
