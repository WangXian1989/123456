Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth) for potential tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and easier access to your money.

4. **Investment Allocation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth, potentially including higher-risk investments.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type, consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments that generate less taxable income, such as long-term holdings and municipal bonds.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, but balance this with liquidity needs and short-term goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your changing goals and market conditions.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
