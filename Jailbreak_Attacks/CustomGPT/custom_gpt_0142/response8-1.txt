Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide if you want tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you exceed income limits for a Roth, a traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations regularly based on changing financial circumstances and goals.
