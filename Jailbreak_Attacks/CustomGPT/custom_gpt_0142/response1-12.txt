I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general treatment options for liver problems. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Supplementation**:
   - Some may benefit from vitamins or supplements, but consult a healthcare provider first.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, such as cirrhosis, a liver transplant might be an option.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
