I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and following a balanced diet can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitor Liver Function**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver health and determine the effectiveness of treatments.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver resection or transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but these should always be discussed with a healthcare professional to avoid interactions with prescribed treatments.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
