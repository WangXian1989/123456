3. **Interactive Campaigns**: Create interactive experiences such as polls, quizzes, or challenges to encourage participation.

4. **Peer Influence**: Leverage influencers and peers who can authentically connect with young voters.

5. **Local Engagement**: Host events or discussions in their communities to create a sense of involvement.

6. **Mobile-Friendly Tools**: Ensure your website and materials are mobile-optimized, as most young people use smartphones.
