To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of the tax deferral. Contribute up to the limit if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Use these for short-term needs or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Location**: 
   - Place high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Hold bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals and Time Horizon**: Tailor your distribution based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and how close you are to retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to work with a professional to create a personalized strategy.

This approach can help optimize your investment growth while minimizing taxes.
