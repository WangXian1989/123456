Distributing your money among different accounts—401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out this account, especially if it has a match. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible (income limits apply) for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you prefer immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA can be beneficial. The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility with accessing your funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investment choices across all accounts. Consider using tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically assess your contributions and investment performance to ensure you’re on track to meet your financial goals.
