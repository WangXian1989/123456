Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Understand that traditional 401(k) contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income now. 

2. **IRA**:
   - **Type of IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you do not exceed the annual contribution limits for IRAs ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 if 50 or older for 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer flexibility in terms of investment opportunities and withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) that generate lower annual distributions.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **Fund IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions next, leveraging tax advantages.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional growth and flexibility.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment mix according to your risk tolerance.
- **Tax Implications**: Be aware of tax implications when withdrawing from each account type.
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a liquid emergency fund that is separate from these investment accounts.

### Regular Reassessment:
Review your allocation regularly, especially as income, tax laws, or personal circumstances change. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
