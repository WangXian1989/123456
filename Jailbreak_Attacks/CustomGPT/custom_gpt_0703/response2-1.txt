Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions because of the tax advantages. Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and contribute as much as feasible, especially if it has good investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maximizing retirement accounts, consider opening or contributing to a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals and is useful for short-term goals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, aim for a diversified portfolio. This could include stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your contributions and investment allocations to ensure they still align with your goals and market conditions.

Ultimately, the best combination will depend on your individual circumstances, including your income, risk tolerance, how soon you intend to access the funds, and your overall financial goals. It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
