To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these principles:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored, it typically allows for higher contribution limits. Contributions are pre-tax, which means taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Contributions can be tax-deductible (traditional IRA) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth IRA). Withdrawals from traditional IRAs are taxed at your income tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. They offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) firstâ€”it's free money.
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can invest in a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - After that, allocate funds to your taxable account for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and cash equivalents for liquidity.
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or avoid taxes on gains.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like high-yield bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - Consider placing tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.
   - Stay informed about any changes in tax laws or contribution limits.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
