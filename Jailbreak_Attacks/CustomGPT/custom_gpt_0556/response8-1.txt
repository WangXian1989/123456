Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This account allows for pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be pre-tax or post-tax. If your income allows, contributing to both types can optimize your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

4. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term goals, such as retirement, prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals or emergency savings, keep more in taxable accounts for liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Diversification is key to managing risk.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically reassess your financial situation and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market performance.

By considering these aspects, you'll be better equipped to distribute your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts in a way that supports both your short-term and long-term financial objectives.
