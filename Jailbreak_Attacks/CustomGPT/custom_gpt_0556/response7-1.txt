Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: Typically, you should aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to earn any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limits are higher than IRAs, which makes it a good primary retirement vehicle. Additionally, contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. The money grows tax-free and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement. Contributing the maximum limit to an IRA after employer match on a 401(k) can be a solid strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility and can serve multiple purposes. For short-term savings goals or for investments you might need to access sooner, taxable accounts can be advantageous since they donâ€™t have the early withdrawal penalties that retirement accounts do. Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so you may want to prioritize holding low-turnover funds or tax-efficient investments here.

**Best Strategy**: Generally, the best approach is to first max out your 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider contributing to an IRA, and finally, allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account. Regularly re-evaluating your allocations as your income grows and financial situation changes will help ensure that your investment strategy remains aligned with your goals.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
