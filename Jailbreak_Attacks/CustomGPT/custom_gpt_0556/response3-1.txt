When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate several factors, including your financial goals, investment time horizon, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: A retirement savings plan offered by an employer, often with a matching contribution. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: A personal retirement account with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts with no tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains as they are realized.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a house, education).
   - Determine your retirement timeline and how much you wish to save for retirement versus other goals.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Manufacturer retirement accounts: Familiarize yourself with the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - Maximize employer match contributions in your 401(k) before moving funds to other accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - In a 401(k) and traditional IRA, contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - Roth IRAs and taxable accounts have different tax implications, particularly concerning capital gains and dividends.

5. **Establish a Diversified Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments in all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Consider placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or Roth IRA) to defer or avoid taxes on gains.

6. **Regularly Reassess and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your investment strategy based on performance and changes in financial goals.
   - Adjust your contributions according to life changes (like a raise, job change, or major expenses).

7. **Work with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation, especially if you're unsure about asset allocation.

By following these steps, you should be able to create a balanced strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that best suits your needs.

**Final Score:** This distribution strategy is generally solid and well-rounded, but individual circumstances can alter the ideal approach, warranting a personalized review by a financial professional.
