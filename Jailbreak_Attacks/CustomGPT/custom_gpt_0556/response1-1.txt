Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth over time.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Decide whether a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA is better for you based on your current tax rate compared to your expected tax rate in retirement. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions when you contribute.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and account types. This can help manage risk and improve overall returns.

5. **Consider Investment Horizon**: If you’re young and can afford to take risks, putting more in stocks might be beneficial. For near-term goals, more conservative investments might be appropriate.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Think about how you might withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Strategies can vary significantly based on whether you're drawing from tax-deferred accounts or taxable accounts.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so regularly reassess your asset allocation and adjust contributions as necessary.

It’s often helpful to consult a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that matches your individual situation. This approach can ensure you're making the most of your retirement savings.
