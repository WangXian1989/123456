Deciding how to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a general outline to help you strategize:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before making extensive investments, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

### 2. **Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts. Depending on your eligibility, you can choose a Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth) IRA.
   - **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a high tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial. If you're expecting to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be better.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide greater flexibility for withdrawals and investment options.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess how much risk you can handle. This will influence your asset allocation across all accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Create a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation according to market changes and your financial goals.

### Example Contribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any surplus funds for investments here after the above contributions.

### Consult with a Financial Advisor
If unsure about the best allocation, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.

This approach ensures you're maximizing growth potential and minimizing taxes, setting a solid foundation for long-term financial health.
