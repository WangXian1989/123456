To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute at least enough to meet that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) contributions after getting the match in your 401(k). For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable since withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, if you anticipate a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial.

4. **Debt Management**:
   - Pay down high-interest debt before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth. Consider bonds or lower-growth assets in taxable accounts, where you'll be taxed on interest and dividends.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about the order of withdrawals. Using taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

8. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals that could incur penalties.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money to enhance growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
