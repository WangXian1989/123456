To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, fund a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact. Consider placing bonds or high-turnover investments here to avoid higher taxes on ordinary income.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments, like stocks or mutual funds, to take advantage of compound growth without annual taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Balance your portfolio with more conservative investments to manage tax implications effectively.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk while capitalizing on potential returns.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Longer investment horizons can afford more risk, so prioritize growth in your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Monitor your asset allocation regularly and rebalance to maintain your desired risk profile.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution efficiently while considering tax implications and growth potential.
