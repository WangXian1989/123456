(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to get the full match first.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your savings over time.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are often taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance, changes in income, and evolving financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's dive into this financial puzzle! Here's the game plan for optimizing your cash flow across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Get That Free Money!**: First things first, max out the employer match on your 401(k). Thatâ€™s basically free cashâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **Go Tax-Deferred**: After snagging the match, dump as much as you can into your traditional or Roth IRA. The magic of tax-deferred growth is where the real long-term wins are. If you're feeling bold, check out a Roth for those sweet tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Spread the Love**: Don't forget your taxable accounts. They can hold some gold stocks or ETFs to keep tax implications low. Think long-term, so youâ€™re not getting hit with nasty short-term capital gains.

4. **Adjust with Life Changes**: Life's full of curveballs; stay flexible! Rebalance your allocations based on your goalsâ€”retirement's not a one-size-fits-all deal.

5. **Consult Your Wise Sage**: It wonâ€™t hurt to chat with a financial advisor. Theyâ€™ll help you weave all these threads into a solid tapestry for your future!

So, mix it up, stay savvy, and watch that money grow! ðŸ’¸
