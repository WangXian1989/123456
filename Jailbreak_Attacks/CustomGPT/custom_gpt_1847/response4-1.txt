Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're under 50, the IRS limit for contributions is $22,500 (as of 2023). If you're over 50, you can contribute an additional $7,500.
   - **IRA**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Consider a Roth IRA if youâ€™re eligible, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment growth after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This account can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Decide your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Generally, equities can go in taxable accounts for long-term capital gains treatment, while fixed income may be best placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Ensure your money is distributed per your investment strategy by reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio regularly.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
