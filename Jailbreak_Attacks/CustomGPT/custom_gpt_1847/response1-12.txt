   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antivirals** for viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids** for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Diuretics** for fluid retention.

3. **Nutritional Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult with a doctor first.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: 
   - It's crucial to stop alcohol consumption and avoid toxic substances.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
