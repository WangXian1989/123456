Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Understand Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower tax consequences or for short-term goals since theyâ€™re subject to capital gains tax.

### 3. **Consider Investment Type:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider dividend-yielding stocks or tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Balance Contributions:**
   - Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions first if you're not at the limit, then fund your IRA, and finally, allocate excess funds to your taxable accounts.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and understanding your investments, you can optimize your distribution strategy effectively.
