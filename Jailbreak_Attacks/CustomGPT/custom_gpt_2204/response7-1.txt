To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize that match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA)**: These grow tax-free until withdrawal, making them ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Good for accessing funds before retirement age and for flexibility, but you'll pay capital gains tax on profits.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account to balance risk across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance and when you plan to access the funds. Longer time horizons may allow for more stock exposure.

5. **Periodic Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and reflect changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.

This approach considers immediate tax benefits, long-term growth potential, and overall financial goals.
