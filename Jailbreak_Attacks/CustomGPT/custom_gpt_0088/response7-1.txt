To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here until you reach the match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

4. **Consider Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts can be more growth-oriented since they are meant for long-term investment.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize more conservative investments or tax-efficient funds to minimize tax implications, as you’ll owe taxes on dividends and gains in the year they’re realized.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your account performance and asset allocation, adjusting contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
