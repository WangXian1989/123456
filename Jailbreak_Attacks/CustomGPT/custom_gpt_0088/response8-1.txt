Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several key factors:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your tax situation, prioritize maxing out IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds that you may need access to before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Keep a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid account separate from your investment accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you would withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k), IRA) accounts.

6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
