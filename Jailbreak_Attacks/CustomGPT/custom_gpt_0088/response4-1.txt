To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-income years, contribute to lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw from each account in retirement to manage your tax burden effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Continually assess your allocation to maintain your desired risk level and adapt to market changes.

6. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

This balanced approach can help optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
