To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Consider maxing out contributions if possible, as the money grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term goals, consider a more aggressive asset allocation in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs). Hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Consider placing higher-growth assets (like stocks) here to defer taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when to withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.
