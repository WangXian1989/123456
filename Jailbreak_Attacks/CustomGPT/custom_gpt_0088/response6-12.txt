Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Here are some general treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes, such as antivirals for hepatitis.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fatty, sugary foods can help.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: Avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver health.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Keeping track of liver function through blood tests.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Please reach out to a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
