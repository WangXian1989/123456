To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match first (if available).
   - Contribute enough to reach your employer's match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if eligible.
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved.
2. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match.
3. **IRA**: Fund to the maximum limit, prioritizing the type based on tax situation.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest surplus funds here for flexibility and liquidity.

### General Distribution:
- **50%** in 401(k) (maximize match).
- **30%** in IRA (traditional or Roth based on your tax bracket).
- **20%** in taxable accounts (for flexibility).

### Considerations:
- Your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals will influence these percentages.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing circumstances.

Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan tailored to your specific situation.
