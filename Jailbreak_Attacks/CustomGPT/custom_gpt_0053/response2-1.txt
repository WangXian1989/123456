Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors like your current income, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a streamlined approach:

### 1. **Maximize Your 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Company Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering current taxable income.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Assess if you can deduct contributions based on income. It's a good option for further tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Roth IRA:** Consider this for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you're eligible based on income limits.

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use these funds for short to medium-term goals, as they can be liquidated anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

### Recommended Allocation Strategy
1. **Fund 401(k) to match limit** (e.g., 5-10% of income).
2. **Max out IRA contributions** ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for 50+).
3. **Allocate leftover funds** to taxable accounts, maintaining an adequate emergency fund.

### Final Tips
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust allocations yearly based on performance and financial goals.
- **Consider a Financial Advisor:** If unsure, seek professional advice tailored to your situation.

### Conclusion
This structured approach helps optimize tax advantages while ensuring your investments are prepared for both current needs and future retirement goals.
