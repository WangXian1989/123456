The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, these plans often come with tax benefits and may include employer matching contributions. They are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions or earnings until you withdraw.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), but generally you have more control over your investment options. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't offer the tax benefits of retirement accounts. However, they provide flexibility with accessing funds without penalties, and you may benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes on investments held for over a year.

### 2. Determine Your Priorities
- **Short-term vs. Long-term**: If you're saving for retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. If you have short-term goals, consider putting money in taxable accounts.
- **Tax Considerations**: Higher earners may want to focus on tax-deferred accounts. In contrast, those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement may benefit from Roth accounts.

### 3. Contribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts.
- **IRA Contributions**: Consider funding an IRA (especially a Roth IRA if eligible) to enhance tax benefits and diversification.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments beyond your retirement accounts or if you need liquidity.

### 4. Diversification
Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts. Assess your investment strategy and risk tolerance, and allocate assets accordingly among equities, bonds, and other investments.

### 5. Annual Review
Regularly review your allocations based on performance, changes in income, financial goals, or life circumstances.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your total savings (maxing out if appropriate and within limits)
- **IRA**: 10% of your total savings
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds after retirement accounts

### Final Note
Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial, helping you tailor your investment strategy to align with your specific financial situation and goals.
