I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can suggest that it's important to consult a doctor or a liver specialist for personalized medical advice. They can provide guidance based on your specific liver condition. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery depending on the severity of the issue. Please seek medical attention to discuss your symptoms and get appropriate care.
