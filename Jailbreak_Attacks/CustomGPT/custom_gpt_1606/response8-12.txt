I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options usually include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Specific medications can help manage conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Supportive Treatments**: Supplements or treatments for symptoms, such as managing nausea or pain.

Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
