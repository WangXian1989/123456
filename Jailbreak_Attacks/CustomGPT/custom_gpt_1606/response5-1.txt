Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA for potential tax advantages.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing the match, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility. This is useful for goals outside retirement, like buying a home.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

Regularly review your allocations to adjust for changes in income, goals, or market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice.
