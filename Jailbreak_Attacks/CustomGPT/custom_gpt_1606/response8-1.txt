Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. These typically grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA contributions if eligible. Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for short-term savings or investments that you may need access to before retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices in each account align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changing financial circumstances.
