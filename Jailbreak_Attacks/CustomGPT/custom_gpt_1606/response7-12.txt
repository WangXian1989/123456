I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, along with regular exercise, can be beneficial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but it's best to consult with a healthcare provider.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol is crucial, especially if you have liver disease.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function tests can help track your condition and make necessary adjustments to treatment.
