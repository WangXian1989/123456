Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Investment Growth and Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) since they benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize bonds or dividend-paying stocks to take advantage of lower capital gains tax on long-term investments.

### 3. **Prioritize Contribution Limits**
   - Ensure you are aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and optimize contributions accordingly.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to reduce risk.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocation and adjust based on performance and any changes in financial goals.

By following these principles, you can effectively manage your investments while maximizing tax benefits.
