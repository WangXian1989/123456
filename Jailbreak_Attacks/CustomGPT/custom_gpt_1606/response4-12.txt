I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, common treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can be crucial.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
