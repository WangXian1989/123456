I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. Treatment usually depends on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis) and can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antiviral medications or other drugs may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
