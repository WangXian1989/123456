(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before directing funds to taxable accounts. Many financial experts recommend the following approach:

1. **401(k) Contribution**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially "free money." Ensure you're contributing at least enough to take advantage of this benefit.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After you've maximized your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). This can provide additional tax advantages and retirement savings options.

3. **401(k) Maximization**: After funding an IRA, if you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, which is beneficial for tax deferral and potentially for lower tax rates in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you maximize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you may allocate additional funds to taxable investments. These accounts provide flexibility and liquidity for your investments but come with different tax implications on gains and dividends.

It's also essential to periodically review and adjust your investment allocations based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
