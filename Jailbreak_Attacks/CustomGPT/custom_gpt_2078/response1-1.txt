When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to evaluate your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Contributions to Employer-Sponsored 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, it is often advisable to contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The maximum contribution limits and tax deferral benefits can help you accumulate wealth over time.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), whether it be a Traditional or Roth IRA, can provide additional tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between them often depends on your current versus anticipated future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds to a taxable investment account. This option does not have contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, providing greater flexibility. However, be aware of capital gains taxes on investment income.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to align with your risk tolerance and timeline. Asset allocation can vary based on the account type due to differing tax implications.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically assess your investment strategy and make adjustments based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals. This practice can help ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your objectives.

6. **Considerations for State Taxes**: Be mindful of your state tax situation, as some states impose taxes on retirement distributions while others do not. This factor might influence your decisions regarding withdrawals from retirement accounts.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your individual circumstances, helping to optimize your investment strategy.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work toward achieving your financial goals.
