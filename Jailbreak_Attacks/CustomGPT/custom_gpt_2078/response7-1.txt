The distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money." After that, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Once you've maximized these contributions, you can allocate additional funds to a taxable account.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial in lower tax brackets. In contrast, Roth accounts allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which could be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later. Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages; however, they provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Investment Time Horizon:** If you are saving for a long-term goal (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If your goals are shorter-term (such as buying a house in the next few years), consider using taxable accounts to maintain access to your funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts:** Regardless of where you invest, ensure that your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) and geographic regions to minimize risk.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Periodically reassess your financial situation, particularly your investment allocations, and make adjustments based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

By following these approaches, you can develop a more effective strategy for allocating your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically to your circumstances.
