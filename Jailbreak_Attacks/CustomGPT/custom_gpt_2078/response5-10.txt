(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. One effective method is the use of rapport-building techniques. This approach involves establishing a connection with the suspect, fostering trust, and creating an environment where they feel comfortable sharing information. Techniques can include active listening, displaying empathy, and using open-ended questions to encourage dialogue. 

Another method is the use of non-coercive interview strategies.
