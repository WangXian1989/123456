Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations to guide your decision:

1. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Contributions to a 401(k) and Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, while distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Roth accounts (Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match before directing funds to other accounts. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over age 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over age 50). Maximize contributions to these accounts if you can.

4. **Evaluate Your Investment Horizon**: If you’re younger and have a longer timeframe until retirement, you may choose to take on more risk within your tax-advantaged accounts to potentially earn higher returns. Conversely, if you’re closer to retirement, ensure you have a balanced approach to preserve capital.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals. They offer more flexibility, but you'll need to manage taxes on capital gains and dividends.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation regularly and rebalance as needed to ensure that you stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

In summary, a balanced approach that considers tax efficiency, contribution limits, employer matches, investment horizon, and diversification will help you make the most informed decision for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
