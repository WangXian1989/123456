Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - Consider traditional vs. Roth: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) may be beneficial. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, consider Roth contributions.

2. **IRA**:
   - Choose between Traditional and Roth: A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Max out contributions: Aim to contribute the maximum limit if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals: Taxable accounts can be suitable for savings goals within a few years, as they provide liquidity.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments: Focus on indexes, ETFs, and municipal bonds to minimize capital gains tax.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) to get the employer match, then contribute to the IRA (especially if eligible for a Roth IRA), and finally fund the taxable account.
2. **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the asset allocation in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
3. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
