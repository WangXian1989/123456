Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach. Hereâ€™s a guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility in access to funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Timeline**
   - Allocate funds based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. Longer-term investments can be more aggressive, while shorter-term savings may need to be more conservative.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

### 6. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Suggested Order:
1. **401(k)** (up to match)
2. **IRA** (max out contributions)
3. **Taxable Accounts** (after maxing out other options)
