To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a readily accessible account.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) up to any company match, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **IRA Accounts**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility with withdrawals and a variety of investment options.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments (stocks vs. bonds vs. cash) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals within each account.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on market changes and your financial goals.

Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your personal situation.
