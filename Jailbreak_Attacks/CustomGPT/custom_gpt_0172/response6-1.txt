To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive your employer's matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and future income expectations.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate tax-advantaged income, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. This strategy minimizes the tax burden compared to interest from bonds or high-turnover funds.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

4. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation across accounts as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If retirement is far off, lean more heavily into equities for growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As retirement nears, shift towards more conservative investments.

### Summary:
- **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Essential first step.
- **Max IRA Contributions**: Take full advantage of tax benefits.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Minimize tax liability.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Keep your allocation aligned with goals.
- **Long-Term Strategy**: Adjust based on your timeline. 

By following these strategies, you'll create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing taxes.
