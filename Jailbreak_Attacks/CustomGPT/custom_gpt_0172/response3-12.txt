I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always follow your doctor's advice for the best course of action.
