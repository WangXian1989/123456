Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money!).
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth; this is great for long-term savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Max out contributions if possible, as IRAs often offer tax advantages.
   - Choose a Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, and a Traditional IRA if you prefer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short- to medium-term goals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Order of Allocation:
- **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**.
- **Max out IRA contributions**.
- **Contribute more to 401(k)** if you have additional funds.
- **Invest in taxable accounts** for flexibility.

### Considerations:
- Assess your risk tolerance.
- Balance growth and stability.
- Monitor tax implications based on your income.

### Personalized Approach:
Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.
