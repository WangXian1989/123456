Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions to benefit from the tax advantages.

2. **Balance Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax consequences, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gains.
   - Consider keeping emergency savings and more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Adjust allocations based on the account type: Generally, you can afford to take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term nature.

4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on market conditions or changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor may provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
