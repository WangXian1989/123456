When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment options, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to guide your decision-making:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, focusing on a Roth IRA if you meet income limits, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Focus on Investment Growth**:
   - For accounts that grow tax-deferred or tax-free (like 401(k) and IRA), consider placing higher-growth investments (such as stocks) in these accounts to maximize the tax benefits over time.
   - In taxable accounts, you might want to hold investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, to reduce your tax burden.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Consider your current tax bracket compared to your expected tax bracket in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) may be less beneficial compared to Roth accounts.

4. **Diversify Withdrawals**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow, and consider your tax bracket each year to optimize your withdrawals.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Market conditions change and your personal circumstances may evolve. Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts and adjust contributions as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can help you navigate complex rules and optimize your investment strategy across different account types.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced portfolio that maximizes your investment growth while minimizing your tax liabilities.
