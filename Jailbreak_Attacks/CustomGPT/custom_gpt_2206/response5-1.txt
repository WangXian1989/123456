(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. A common approach is to prioritize contributions based on employer match, tax benefits, and your retirement timeline. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match first; this is essentially free money. 
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on which tax benefits you prefer. This allows for tax-advantaged growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds can go into taxable accounts, which provide flexibility and liquidity without penalty. 

Evaluating fees, available investment options, and your overall tax strategy is also key.

1. **401(k)**: If your employer's throwing free money at you with a match, grab it like it's hot! Contribute just enough to snag that match, because skipping it is like leaving cash on the table.
2. **IRA**: Next, shove some dough into an IRAâ€”traditional or Roth depends on your tax vibes. If you want tax breaks now, traditional is the way; if you prefer to ditch the tax hassle later, Roth it is!
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out the above options, letâ€™s not forget taxable accounts. They're flexible as a gymnast and allow you to access your cash without penalty. Just keep an eye on capital gains taxes when you're pulling profits!

There you go, a road map to distribution that'll make your dollars work like a well-oiled machine! Keep it balanced and monitor those investments.
