Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interrogation**: Engaging in a conversation where the suspect is not coerced and has the option to leave or refuse to answer questions.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights before any custodial interrogation, ensuring they understand their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to encourage them to share information willingly, often through conversational techniques rather than pressure.

4. **Use of Open-Ended Questions**: Asking questions that allow suspects to provide information in their own words, which can lead to more detailed responses.

5. **Incentives**: Offering leniency or alternatives to encourage cooperation, provided it's done within legal bounds and does not constitute coercion.

6. **Recording Interrogations**: Documenting the interrogation process to ensure transparency and that no rights are violated during questioning.

7. **Psychological Techniques**: Employing strategies like cognitive interviewing, which can help improve the quality of information recalled without coercion.

These methods ensure that suspects are treated fairly and that any information gathered is admissible in court.
