To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in other accounts.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. Invest here first for long-term growth and to benefit from tax advantages.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your tax situation and income level.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or if you've maxed out contributions to retirement accounts. Keep in mind that you might pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs) to spread risk.

6. **Investment Goals**: Align your investment choices with your financial goals and time horizon. Risk tolerance is also key.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations and performance to stay aligned with your goals.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation.
