The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are key strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Allocate excess funds to taxable accounts when you've maxed out tax-advantaged options. This helps maintain liquidity and offers capital gains tax advantages if investments are held long-term.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, emphasize pre-tax contributions (401(k), Traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income. If in a lower bracket, Roth accounts can be more beneficial.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, and life events.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
