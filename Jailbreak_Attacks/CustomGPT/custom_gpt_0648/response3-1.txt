Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions, which can offer additional tax benefits.
   
2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments in a 401(k) and IRA grow tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth accounts), while taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Prioritize growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a taxable account, which can be easily accessed without penalties.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks generally have higher growth potential and are suitable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts. Bonds can be in taxable accounts for income generation.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocation periodically based on performance, risk tolerance, and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider meeting with a financial planner who can evaluate your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual financial situation and objectives.
