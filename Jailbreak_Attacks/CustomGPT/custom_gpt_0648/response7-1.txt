When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Balance Contributions**: Invest in your 401(k) and IRA according to your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and investment options. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need more access to in the short term, as they typically have fewer restrictions compared to retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while keeping more income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where they may be taxed at a lower rate.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
