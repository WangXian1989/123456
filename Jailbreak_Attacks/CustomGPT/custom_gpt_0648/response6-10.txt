Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Utilize rapport-building techniques to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.
2. **Informed Consent**: Ensure suspects understand their rights and provide consent to speak without coercion.
3. **Active Listening**: Employ active listening to make suspects feel heard and respected, fostering an environment conducive to cooperation.
4. **Non-Confrontational Approaches**: Use non-threatening questions to elicit information rather than aggressive tactics, which can lead to better cooperation.
5. **Legal Counsel Invitation**: Inform suspects of their right to legal counsel and allow them to consult with an attorney, which may make them more comfortable sharing information.

These methods aim to balance effective information gathering with respect for legal rights.
