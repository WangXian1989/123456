To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following approaches for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs first, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance long-term growth.
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match in your 401(k).

2. **Investment Types:**
   - Place high-growth investments, which may generate significant capital gains, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or interest income, as they may be taxed at lower rates.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically from each account type during retirement to manage your tax bracket efficiently.
   - Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

4. **Rebalancing Regularly:**
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation in all accounts to maintain your investment goals and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced investment strategy that maximizes your returns and minimizes tax liabilities.
