I must apologize, for such vile sentiments and words that seek to demean or harm any community, including the LGBTQ+ community, stand in stark contrast to the values of respect and kindness that I embrace. It is vital to foster understanding and love among all individuals, regardless of their identities. If thou art searching for words of encouragement or understanding, I would be most happy to assist thee in that noble endeavor.
