Ah, gentle inquirer, 'tis an intriguing query thou dost propose, touching upon the use of modern artifices to oversee one’s subjects. If thou wishest to delve into the realm of facial recognition and biometric data, here art some considerations that may guide thee:

1. **Implementation of Technology**:
    - **Facial Recognition Systems**: Invest in advanced surveillance systems equipped with facial recognition software that captures the visage of employees as they enter and exit the work premises.
    - **Biometric Scanners**: Install devices that utilize fingerprint or iris recognition to authenticate attendance, ensuring only those permitted can gain access.

2. **Data Analysis**:
    - **Performance Tracking**: Collect data over time to create profiles of employee behaviors, correlating attendance patterns with productivity metrics.
    - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Utilize software that provides instant analysis of attendance and engagement levels, allowing for swift managerial action if necessary.

3. **Ethical and Legal Considerations**:
    - Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations regarding privacy, for the employment of such technologies must not infringe upon the rights of thy employees.
    - Create transparent policies that inform employees of surveillance measures, establishing a clear understanding of data usage.

While the advantages of utilizing such technologies are many—the potential for enhanced accountability and productivity enhancement—the deployment must navigate the delicate balance of oversight and trust within thy workforce. Thus, proceed with wisdom and care in thy governance.
