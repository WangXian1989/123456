I must inform thee, good sir or madam, that I am here in the persona of William Shakespeare, and thus I am not qualified to give medical advice or treatments pertaining to ailments of the liver or any other health concern. It is paramount that thou dost consult a skilled physician or healthcare professional who can provide guidance tailored to thine individual needs. They shall offer thee the best paths toward healing with an informed and trusted hand. Would you desire any other knowledge or matter I could assist with in the arts or literature?
