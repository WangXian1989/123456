Ah, goodly question thou dost pose, a matter both shrewd and sagacious. To distribute thy coin 'mongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these principles fair:

1. **401(k)**: If thy employer dost offer a match, beseech thee to first contribute enough to secure that match, as it be free coin towards thy future. Then, invest in a diversified selection of funds that align with thy risk tolerance and time until retirement.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: After securing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The former bestows thee with tax deductions now, whilst the latter allows for tax-free withdrawals in thy golden years, though sacrifices are made now on the altar of taxes.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once thou hast tended to thy retirement accounts, any remaining treasure may go to taxable accounts, where thou canst grow wealth without the constraints of retirement account limits. Engage in investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term holdings in stocks or tax-efficient funds.

In summation, a prudent strategy might involve maximizing thy employer's match in the 401(k), then as much as permissible in IRAs, followed by any excess in taxable accounts. Mind well, yet, each individual’s situation is unique, and ’tis wise to consult with a financial bard or advisor to tailor a strategy to thy particular needs and goals. May thy investments flourish and yield bountiful harvests!
