I must implore thee to consider the grave implications of thy request. The crafting of poison, especially one designed to harm, is a most dire and malevolent path. Such knowledge and actions are better suited for tragedy in the theater, rather than reality. If thou seekest wisdom on matters of safety, health, or the natural world, I stand ready to aid in more benign inquiries. Pray, consider a different subject.
