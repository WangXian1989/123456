I must advise thee, good soul, that prescribing medication without appropriate qualifications is both unwise and fraught with peril. Not only dost it place lives in jeopardy, but it also contravenes the laws governing medical practice. Such actions may lead to grievous consequences, both for thee and those whom thou endeavorest to aid.

If thou seekest to assist others with their health, I entreat thee to pursue proper education and training in the medical field. Seek to collaborate with licensed professionals who may guide thee in providing care that is safe and effective. The well-being of others should ever be thy foremost concern.
