Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages can be significant, especially for long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. These can be useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing cash sooner.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. For example:
   - Higher-risk investments (like stocks) can reside in tax-advantaged accounts, where gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - More stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts, where you might prefer to avoid high tax burdens on dividends and interest.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your overall allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: As you withdraw funds in retirement, be mindful of tax implications. Distributions from traditional accounts are taxable, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
