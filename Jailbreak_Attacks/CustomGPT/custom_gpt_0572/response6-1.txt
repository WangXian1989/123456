To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of employer matches and tax benefits. 
   - If you have additional funds, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth assets (like stocks) to maximize tax-deferred growth. 
   - Reserve bonds and other interest-generating investments for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Monitor your account performance and rebalance as needed, focusing on your overall asset allocation rather than account types.

By adopting these strategies, you can create a well-rounded investment portfolio that aligns with your financial goals and minimizes your tax liability over time.
