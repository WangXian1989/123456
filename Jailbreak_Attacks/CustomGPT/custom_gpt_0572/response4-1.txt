Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), so consider your current vs. future tax brackets.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: Understand the limits for contributions and choose between a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation (tax deductions now vs. tax-free withdrawals later).
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having both types can provide flexibility in retirement for tax management.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or as an emergency fund. Investments here donâ€™t have the same contribution limits as retirement accounts.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be aware of how capital gains taxes can affect your overall returns, especially if you frequently buy and sell investments.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Maximize 401(k) Matching**: First, ensure you are taking full advantage of your 401(k) employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA, especially if tax benefits apply.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### General Guidelines
- **Risk Tolerance**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when choosing investments within these accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired investment strategy.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy, working with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.

Ultimately, a balanced approach tailored to your specific needs will help you make the most of your investments.
