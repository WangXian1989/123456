To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax advantages; Roth accounts grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility and access; taxed on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Utilize your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments expected to appreciate significantly, as taxes on those gains are deferred or avoided.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, balancing risk and growth according to your timeline.
   - Consider using different asset classes in each account type (e.g., high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts).

5. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to your IRA (up to the limit).
   - If you have excess funds, return to your 401(k) or use a taxable account based on your cash flow needs.

6. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your retirement goals and timeline.

By following these guidelines, you'll optimize your investment strategy across different account types.
