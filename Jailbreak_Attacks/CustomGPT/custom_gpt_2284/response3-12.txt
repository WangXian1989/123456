I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and assess any progression of the disease.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Stay away from substances that can further harm the liver, such as alcohol and certain medications.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where the liver is failing and other treatments aren't effective, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
