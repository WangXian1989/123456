Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
- **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. Evaluate Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider your investment strategy here. Favor investments with favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 3. Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance
- **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more to equities in retirement accounts, where gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.
- **Short-Term Needs**: Keep a higher portion in more liquid and lower-risk investments in taxable accounts to access funds as needed.

### Suggested Distribution Model
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your total investments until maxed.
- **IRA**: Increase allocations up to the annual limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds based on liquidity needs and risk tolerance.

### Key Considerations
- **Fees**: Be mindful of the fees associated with each account type, as these can erode your returns.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk profile.

This strategy ensures you maximize tax benefits while aligning with your financial goals.
