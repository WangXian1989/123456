Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
   - Focus on maxing out contributions if you're nearing retirement or have high income, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you’re in a lower tax bracket now.
   - Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits; consider them if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short to medium-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and life changes.
- **Tax Planning**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals during retirement and aim for a balance that minimizes your overall tax burden.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor the plan to your specific situation.
