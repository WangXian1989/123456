To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these tips:

1. **Tax Advantage**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if possible, especially if your employer offers a match on your 401(k). This is essentially free money.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on equity funds or target-date funds, particularly if your employer offers low-cost options.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, consider a mix of stocks and bonds. A Roth IRA can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds or other interest-bearing assets in tax-advantaged accounts instead.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement; withdrawing from taxable accounts first may provide tax advantages.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Itâ€™s always good to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
