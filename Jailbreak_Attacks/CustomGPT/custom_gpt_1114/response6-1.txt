Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** 
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
     - Consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement may be tax-free.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
     - Keep investments in a taxable account for short-term goals or emergencies, where you might need access to funds without penalties.

### 2. **Consider Investment Diversification**
   - **401(k):**
     - Focus on growth-oriented investments if you're years away from retirement.
   - **IRA:**
     - Take advantage of lower-fee index funds or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Regularly Review Tax Implications:**
     - Withdraw from tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and IRA in retirement when your taxable income may be lower.
     - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### Summary
Balancing your assets strategically among these accounts can optimize your investment growth while managing tax liabilities effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
