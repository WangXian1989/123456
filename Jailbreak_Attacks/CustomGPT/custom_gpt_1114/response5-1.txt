To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This account is beneficial for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: A Traditional IRA might offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA grows tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. They can be used for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts; typically, this means 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments to manage riskâ€”consider index funds, stocks, and bonds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with your retirement goals. The earlier you start investing, especially in tax-advantaged accounts, the more you can benefit from compound growth.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your contributions and asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.
