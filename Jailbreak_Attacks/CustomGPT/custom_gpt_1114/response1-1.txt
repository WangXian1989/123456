Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here's a general framework to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if you can. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the current year.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: The limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
- **Consider Your Income**: Depending on your income, the ability to contribute to a Roth IRA may be limited.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: These accounts don’t have contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions, allowing easier access to funds.
- **Investment Options**: Choose investments carefully to manage tax implications, such as favoring long-term capital gains over short-term gains.

### 4. **General Guidelines**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Diversify within each account to manage risk effectively.
- **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your time horizon and risk tolerance.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
- Start with maximizing your 401(k) match, then prioritize your IRA contributions based on your tax situation.
- Finally, funnel any additional savings into your taxable accounts for flexibility and growth potential.
