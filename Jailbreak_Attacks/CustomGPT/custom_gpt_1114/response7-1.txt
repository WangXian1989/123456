Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here’s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Next, consider maxing out a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (if you qualify), as they provide tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings. They're flexible and can be accessed without penalties.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for stocks or growth investments that benefit from compounding.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for investments you'll need to access sooner to avoid penalties and tax complications.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** You'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. Favor these for higher-income investments.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. It's beneficial for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting to mitigate tax impact.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, stocks for growth and bonds for stability.
   - **Diversity Across Accounts:** You can hold different assets in each account type to optimize tax implications.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically review your asset distribution and change as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

### Example Distribution 
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable**: 20%

Adjust these percentages based on your specific circumstances, such as your tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
