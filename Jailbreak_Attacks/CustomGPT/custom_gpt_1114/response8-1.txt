Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax but can grow tax-free. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide flexibility, as you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties. However, you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Prioritize Emergency Savings**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have a robust emergency fund in a high-yield savings account.

4. **Diversification**: Distribute your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across these accounts to manage risk.

5. **Long-term Strategy**: If you're investing for retirement, focus on tax-advantaged accounts first, especially if youâ€™re younger. Taxable accounts can be more beneficial for short-term goals.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to your accounts to ensure consistent investing.

7. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

It may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specifically to your circumstances.
