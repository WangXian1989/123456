1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet low in saturated fats, refined sugars, and sodium.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoiding alcohol and limiting exposure to toxins.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific condition, medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying diseases (like antiviral medications for viral hepatitis) might be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some people explore herbal supplements, but consult a doctor before starting any.

For a tailored approach, please speak with your doctor. They can provide the most appropriate advice based on your specific condition.
