Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Determine Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**:
     - **Contribution Limits**: Aim to maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
     - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide if you want immediate tax benefits (pre-tax) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).

   - **IRA**:
     - **Contribution Limits**: Fund your traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing the 401(k).
     - **Tax Considerations**: Choose based on your income level and expected tax bracket at retirement.

### 3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as:
     - **Index Funds/ETFs**: Lower turnover means fewer capital gains taxes.
     - **Tax-Managed Funds**: Designed to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Consider Asset Location**
   - **Tax-Heavy Investments**: Place in tax-advantaged accounts (bonds, REITs).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Hold in taxable accounts (stocks).

### 5. **Adjust as Needed**
   - **Rebalance**: Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your goals and market changes.
   - **Life Changes**: Adjust your strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal financial advice can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds here for investments aimed at short-term goals or liquidity.

This strategy can help optimize your tax advantages while preparing for your financial future.
