When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general strategies:

### 1. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Focus on maximizing employer match if available.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s traditional or Roth, contributions can be tax-deductible or tax-free on withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and interest income.

### 2. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) within each account type, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Consider tax-efficient funds for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Adhere to annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize growth potential:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+ for 2024).
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+) for 2024.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds, particularly from tax-deferred accounts during retirement to manage tax liabilities effectively.
