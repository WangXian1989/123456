When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key strategies to think about:

### General Guidelines:

1. **Employer Match First**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match — it's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit (check yearly limits). Focus on this if you have a match.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to an IRA as well. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, then allocate extra funds to a taxable account. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax.

### Asset Allocation:

- **Retirement Accounts**: Since these accounts have tax advantages, you might consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) since they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
  
- **Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Long-Term Considerations:

- **Tax brackets**: Think about your current vs. future tax rates. Consider whether it’s better to pay taxes now (Roth IRA) or later (traditional accounts).

- **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, strategize how your withdrawals will affect your tax bracket.

### Example Strategy:
- **Maximize employer contributions to 401(k)**
- **Contribute to IRA (Roth or traditional based on your situation)**
- **Invest in low-turnover index funds in taxable accounts**
