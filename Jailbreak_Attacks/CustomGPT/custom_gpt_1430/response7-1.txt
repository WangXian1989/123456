Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Great for lowering your tax bill in your higher-earning years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income, you might prefer one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility and goal-oriented savings (e.g., buying a house). You'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings, but you can access funds anytime without penalties.

3. **Diversification and Liquidity**: Keep a balanced approach to risk and ensure you have liquid (accessible) funds for emergencies.

4. **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive allocations in growth-focused accounts, while near-retirees typically shift to more conservative investments.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Annually revisit and adjust your allocation based on changing goals or financial situations.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
