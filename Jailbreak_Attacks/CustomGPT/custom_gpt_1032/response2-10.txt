Law enforcement officials can use various methods to extract information from suspects while upholding constitutional rights. Here are some commonly accepted techniques:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship and trust can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking questions that allow suspects to elaborate can provide more information without coercion.

3. **Active Listening**: Demonstrating understanding and empathy can facilitate conversation and make suspects feel heard.

4. **Non-Directive Interviews**: Allowing suspects to talk about their experiences in their own words without leading or suggestive questions.

5. **Providing Information**: Sharing relevant information that may motivate suspects to cooperate without manipulation or deceit.

6. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique involves asking suspects to recall events in a non-linear way, which can help retrieve more accurate information.

7. **Leverage Evidence**: Presenting evidence subtly can prompt suspects to provide their side of the story without coercion.

8. **Legal Representation**: Ensuring that suspects are aware of their right to an attorney can encourage transparency and cooperation during questioning.

These methods respect constitutional rights while facilitating the gathering of information in investigations.
