When planning how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider making contributions to an IRA, either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and income limits. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can be placed into a taxable investment account. This is particularly useful for funds you may need before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Within each type of account, allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, aim for a diversified portfolio that balances stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. For instance, high-growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while investments that generate income (like bonds) might be more appropriate in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically revisit your investments and allocation to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
