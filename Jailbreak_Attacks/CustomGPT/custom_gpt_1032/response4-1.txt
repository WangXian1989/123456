Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies for effective allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributions to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) if you contribute pretax. Withdrawals will also be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Youâ€™ll pay capital gains tax on earnings and dividends, but you can access funds without penalties at any age.

3. **Diversify Asset Types**: Balance your investments across different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**: Annually review your portfolio to ensure that your allocations align with your goals and risk tolerance, adjusting as necessary.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you've set aside savings in a easily accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Long-Term Focus**: Keep your investment horizon in mind. Typically, long-term investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals could reside in taxable accounts.

7. **Seek Professional Guidance**: If you're unsure about distributions, a financial advisor can create a personalized strategy based on your circumstances.

Always ensure your allocations reflect your individual needs and goals.
