Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out your contributions if you're eligible, as these accounts offer tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider the Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that have low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider municipal bonds or funds that focus on tax efficiency.
   - **Tax-Deferred versus Taxable Growth:** Prioritize accounts where your investments can grow without immediate tax implications (401(k) and IRA) over time-sensitive needs for taxable accounts.

### 3. **Allocate Based on Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals:** Funds meant for retirement should go into tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term savings might be better suited for a taxable account for easier access.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored plans and IRAs.**
- **Be strategic about asset placement based on tax implications and investment goals.**
