(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you might consider the following:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k) plan, especially if they offer a match. This is a great way to secure free money for retirement.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments not suitable for retirement accounts. Itâ€™s important to be mindful of capital gains taxes with these accounts.

Balancing these accounts based on your immediate cash flow needs and long-term investment strategy is essential. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
