(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, you might consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your 401(k) has an employer match, try to contribute enough to receive the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for additional tax-advantaged growth. The choice between Roth and Traditional depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment flexibility. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments across these accounts align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a specific strategy to your situation.

First off, if your employerâ€™s throwin' in some free cash with a 401(k) match, you better grab that before anything else! Itâ€™s like finding a twenty in your couch cushionsâ€”donâ€™t leave that money sitting around!

Next, dive into that IRA action! If you're feeling like a future tax hero, a Roth IRA can be your ticket to tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA is great if you want to dodge taxes now. Once you've handled those, slide into your taxable accounts. Sure, theyâ€™re not as sweet on the tax front, but they give you flexibility. Just make sure to pick investments that wonâ€™t screw you over on capital gains tax! 

Mix it up, keep your eye on those asset allocations, and consider hitting up a financial advisor for some wizard-level advice tailored just for you! Happy investing!
