Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic decision that depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money. Once you've maxed out the match, you can consider your other accounts.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for funds that you might need in the short to medium term since you can access them without penalty. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** 401(k)s and traditional IRAs offer tax deferral, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal, typically in retirement. It's generally advantageous to withdraw from these accounts when you're in a lower tax bracket.

3. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance, this could mean having different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust the distribution periodically based on your changing circumstances and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
