To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of your employer's match. If possible, increase contributions to reach the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The annual contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if 50 or older).
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, investing in taxable accounts can be beneficial. These accounts are flexible and allow you to access funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your retirement goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This ensures youâ€™re not too exposed to any single asset class, especially as you approach retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have a complex financial situation or are unsure about your allocation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money to optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency.
