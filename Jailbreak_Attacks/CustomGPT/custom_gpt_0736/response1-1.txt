Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k):** After employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) if you have remaining funds, especially if you have a high-income potential or a solid investment strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but can be subjected to capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Risk Tolerance:** Depending on your age and risk tolerance, allocate your investments between stocks, bonds, and other vehicles across all accounts. Generally, younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may want to reduce risk.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across accounts are properly diversified to minimize risk and take advantage of different asset classes.

6. **Rebalancing:** Regularly assess your allocations and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Professional:** It's often beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Always consider how each type of account fits into your overall financial plan and goals.
