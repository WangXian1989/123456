Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money" and increases your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and income level. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Increase Contributions to 401(k):** Once you've contributed to your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions. In 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Higher contributions may help reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account for additional investment flexibility. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you want more access to your funds before retirement.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. Different accounts may have different tax implications, so consider using tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (such as index funds) and holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure that you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account to cover unexpected expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Depending on your financial situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Always keep in mind the rules and benefits associated with each account type and consider revisiting your strategy as your financial situation changes.
