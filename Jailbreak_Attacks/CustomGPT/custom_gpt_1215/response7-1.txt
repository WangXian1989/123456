To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance growth over time.
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, select based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

2. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or tax-managed funds. Reserve high-growth or high-income-generating assets for tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts. Generally, withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your investment strategy and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

By prioritizing tax advantages, diversifying wisely, and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can optimize your investment distribution across these accounts.
