When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep a few factors in mind, such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, which is $22,500 for 2024 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit is $6,500 for 2024 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). 

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Dividends and capital gains are taxable. Consider holding investments with lower turnover or tax-efficient funds here.

3. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals:**
   - Short-term goals (within 5 years): Keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.
   - Long-term goals: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding growth without immediate tax consequences.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
