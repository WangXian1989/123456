Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to max out the employer match. If you can, consider increasing contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Once you’ve optimized your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth offers tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and access. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you want to invest in assets that may be taxed at a lower rate (like long-term capital gains).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Focus on how you allocate investments within these accounts. Generally, you'd want more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth while using more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize short-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Regular Review**: Re-evaluate your contributions and asset allocations periodically based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances, especially regarding tax implications.
