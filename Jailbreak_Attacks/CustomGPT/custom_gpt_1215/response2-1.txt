Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, making this an excellent place for pre-tax contributions. Employer matching contributions can also significantly boost your savings.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals), you can strategize your contributions for tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since earnings are taxed annually, use these for investments that generate minimal taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance. For long-term retirement needs, you might want a more aggressive allocation in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For shorter-term goals or more liquid needs, prioritize your taxable accounts, focusing on more stable investments.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type: 401(k) limits are typically higher than IRAs, which can influence how you allocate funds.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified. This can mean holding different asset classes across all accounts rather than concentrating certain types of investments in one account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds. Taxed accounts can provide flexibility for emergencies, while tax-advantaged accounts should ideally be left to grow until retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax implications and your individual financial situation, speaking with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

In general, consider maximizing contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs for tax benefits, using taxable accounts for liquidity and diversification.
