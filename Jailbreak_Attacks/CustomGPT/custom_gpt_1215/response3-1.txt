To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, and you may benefit from employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). They have contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility and no contribution limits.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - If eligible, maximize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. This is particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Have a strategy for your traditional IRA contributions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you withdraw funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**: 
   Allocate your funds across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider using tax-efficient index funds or ETFs to enhance growth while managing costs.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place bond investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) to shield income from taxes.
   - Keep stocks in your taxable account to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: 
   Monitor your investments and asset allocation annually. Adjust contributions based on market conditions, tax law changes, and personal financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   If uncertain, seek personalized advice to align your investment strategy with your financial goals and tax situation.

By taking these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient distribution strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
