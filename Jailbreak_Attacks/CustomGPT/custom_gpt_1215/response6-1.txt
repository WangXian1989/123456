To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Account Type and Impact:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Avoid high-turnover investments that could trigger short-term capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid, low-risk investments in taxable accounts for immediate access.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on equity investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding without immediate tax implications.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline, adjusting the mix between accounts as necessary.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for tax efficiency and growth potential.
