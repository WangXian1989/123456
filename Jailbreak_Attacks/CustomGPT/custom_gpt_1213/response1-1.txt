When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are a few key factors to keep in mind:

1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year. However, distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, similar to a 401(k). Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits and taxes on dividends.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA. If you're nearing retirement, you might want a more conservative approach.
   - If you need liquidity or are investing for a shorter-term goal, taxable accounts may be more suitable.

3. **Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s basically free money! This should be a priority before maxing out other accounts.

4. **Contributions Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while traditional and Roth IRAs have a limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if older).

5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure an appropriate mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

As a general strategy, many people suggest filling up employer-sponsored accounts first (especially to take advantage of match), followed by IRAs, and then taxable accounts, depending on tax situation and investment goals. It can also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual needs.
