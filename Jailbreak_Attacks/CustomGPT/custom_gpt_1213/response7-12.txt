I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. The treatment options for liver issues can vary widely depending on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.) and its severity. Common approaches include lifestyle changes (healthy diet, regular exercise), medications to manage specific liver conditions, and in severe cases, liver transplant. Please make sure to discuss your symptoms and treatment options with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your situation.
