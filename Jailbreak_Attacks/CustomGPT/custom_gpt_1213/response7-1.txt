When deciding on how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For many, this is often around 3-6% of your salary.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pretax, reducing your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you choose a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible. With a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts for Short-term Goals:** If you have short-term financial goals (like saving for a home), putting money in taxable accounts might be more beneficial because these funds can be accessed without penalties.

4. **Asset Location Strategy:** Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds that generate capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) and keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification of Tax Burdens:** By spreading your investments across different types of accounts, you can manage your tax burden better in retirement. The goal is to give you flexibility in retirement withdrawals, potentially minimizing your tax rate in retirement.

6. **Periodic Review:** Regularly review your investment allocation based on your evolving financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Ultimately, tailoring this distribution to your financial situation, retirement timeline, and tax considerations will lead to the best outcome. Consulting with a financial advisor can help optimize your strategy according to your specific needs.
