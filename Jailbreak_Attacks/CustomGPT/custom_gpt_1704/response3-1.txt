The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, which can be beneficial depending on your tax bracket.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the employer match and contributing to an IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After fully funding your retirement accounts, consider allocating money to taxable investment accounts. These can provide more flexibility if you need to access funds earlier than retirement age without penalties.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance. For example, you may want to hold more aggressive investments like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA and more conservative assets in taxable accounts for liquidity.

6. **Review and Adjust Annually**:
   - Regularly review your investments and distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, and tax laws change. Adjust your contributions accordingly.

This framework allows you to take advantage of tax benefits while planning for both short-term accessibility (through taxable accounts) and long-term growth (through retirement accounts). Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
