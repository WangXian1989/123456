To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA:**
   - After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Taxable accounts might offer more liquidity and flexibility, but they are also taxed on dividends and capital gains. Keeping investments that generate little taxable income in taxable accounts (like index funds) can be beneficial.

4. **Balance Growth and Risk:**
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors typically opt for a more aggressive allocation in these accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure your investment choices across accounts are diversified to spread risk. Avoid putting similar assets in different accounts.

6. **Review Periodically:**
   - Adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change. Regular reviews can help ensure you stay on track.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your investments in this way, you can maximize retirement savings while managing tax implications effectively. Would you like more detailed information on any of these points?
