When it comes to determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: A retirement account offered by employers that may include contributions from the employer. Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your tax burden in the current year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. You can have a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions, where withdrawals in retirement are typically tax-free).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have tax advantages. You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, at least contribute enough to get the full match; that's essentially free money. 
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding an IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, as it can provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Investments**: Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Balance Your Asset Allocation**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Be mindful of where you hold certain asset types. For example, higher-growth investments (like stocks) can be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

### 4. **Keep an Eye on Fees**
   - Look into the fees associated with the funds available in your 401(k) versus those in your IRA and taxable accounts. Aim to minimize costs where possible.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If youâ€™re closer to retirement, you might want to shift your asset allocation to more conservative investments. If you have a longer time horizon, you may invest more aggressively.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Consistently review your asset allocation and distribution strategy, adjusting based on changes in the market, your financial situation, and your retirement goals.

### 7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure about the best distribution for your specific situation, talking to a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work toward achieving your long-term financial goals.
