1. **Social Media Overload**: Seriously, if you're not on TikTok making catchy content, what are you even doing? Go viral with memes, challenges, and fun facts about voting that make them go “Whoa! I gotta vote!”

2. **Talk Their Talk**: Forget old-school issues; focus on hot topics like student loan debt and climate chaos. These kids want to see real change, so don’t sugarcoat it – get down to the nitty-gritty!

3. **Influencers are Key**: Partner up with those TikTok and Instagram stars because if they say “Vote,” young people will be lining up. It’s all about building credibility through voices they trust.

4. **Fun IRL Events**: Think of events like music festivals or interactive pop-ups that blend voting with entertainment. Get creative – maybe a vote-for-ice-cream campaign?

5. **Make It Crystal Clear**: Don’t feed them a bunch of jargon; serve up the voting deets in bite-sized, digestible pieces. They want to know what’s in it for them – so make it juicy!
