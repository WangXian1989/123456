To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out your contribution if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), as you wonâ€™t be taxed on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Place more conservative investments or cash in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and avoid penalties on early withdrawals.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency Strategies**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting:** Offset capital gains by selling underperforming investments at a loss in your taxable accounts.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - **Rebalance:** Monitor the performance and redistribute as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - **Adjust Contributions:** If you receive a raise or bonus, consider increasing your contributions to take advantage of compounding growth.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
- Focus long-term investments in tax-sheltered accounts and keep taxable accounts more liquid and tax-efficient.  
- Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals.  

By following these guidelines, you can strategically distribute your money to optimize growth and minimize tax liabilities.
