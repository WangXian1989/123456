Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maximizing contributions, especially to get any employer match.
   - **Investment Options:** 401(k) plans often have limited investment choices compared to IRAs. Choose funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
   - **Withdrawal Rules:** Keep in mind that penalties apply for withdrawals before age 59Â½.

2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar benefits as a 401(k) with tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs and choose based on whether you want tax deductions now or tax-free income later.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Money can be withdrawn anytime without penalties, making this account more flexible for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends. Tax-efficient investing strategies can help minimize tax impact.
   - **Investment Choices:** Typically offers a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k) or IRA accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
- **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect your tax rate to increase.
- **Diversify Across Accounts:** Hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in Roth IRAs) where gains are tax-free, while holding safer investments in taxable accounts where dividends may be taxed.
- **Manage Risk and Time Horizon:** Allocate funds based on your investment timeline, risk tolerance, and financial objectives.

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k):** Max contributions up to the match limit.
2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Contribute the maximum allowed based on your situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest leftover funds based on your risk tolerance and goals.
