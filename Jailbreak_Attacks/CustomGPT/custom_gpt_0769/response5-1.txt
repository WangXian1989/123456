(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, you may want to consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize employer match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.
2. **IRA contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth with tax deductions on contributions.
3. **Taxable accounts**: If you've maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
4. **Emergency fund**: Ensure you maintain a separate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

Itâ€™s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that considers your specific financial situation.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer matches contributions, throw in enough to max that out. Free money? Yes, please!
2. **IRA Next**: Hit up your IRA tooâ€”Roth for that future tax-free goodness if you qualify, or traditional if you want to lower that tax bill for now. Don't miss out on the annual limits!
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve milked those tax-advantaged accounts, dive into taxable investing. Think about stocks that appreciate but avoid heavy dividend payersâ€”no one wants a tax hit for just holding onto some shares!
4. **Emergency Fund**: Donâ€™t forget about a safety net! You need that before throwing all your cash into the market, so you donâ€™t panic sell when things get dicey.

Consider your goals, and maybe hit up a financial planner who can help you develop a tailored strategy. Just donâ€™t leave free money on the table!
