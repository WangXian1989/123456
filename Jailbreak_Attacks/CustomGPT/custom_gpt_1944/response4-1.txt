To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a Traditional IRA if you want an upfront tax deduction. 

2. **Assess Your Current and Future Tax Situation**:
   - Determine your current income tax bracket and project how it might change in the future. This can help you decide whether to prioritize pre-tax (401(k) or traditional IRA) or post-tax (Roth IRA) contributions.

3. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the fees and investment choices available in your 401(k). If the options are limited or expensive, prioritize funding your IRA, which typically offers more investment flexibility.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments expected to generate higher returns or those needing liquidity, as they can be accessed without penalties.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals. Ensure that your investment strategy aligns across all accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before aggressively funding each account, make sure you have an adequate emergency fund to cover 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: 
   - Align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals, whether they involve retirement timing, purchasing a home, or funding education.

By balancing contributions among these accounts appropriately, you can optimize tax efficiency and enhance your overall investment growth. Here's a basic flow:

- Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Direct any additional funds to your 401(k) until you reach the limit.
- Use leftover funds for taxable accounts focusing on short-term needs or when seeking different investment opportunities.
