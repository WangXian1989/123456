To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Treatment:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Both are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax and income tax on dividends, which can impact your overall returns.

### 2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** In 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No contribution limits, but it's important to consider how much you want to keep liquid for short-term needs.

### 3. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for money you'll need in the near term to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate according to your risk tolerance, ensuring diversification across all accounts. Consider holding riskier investments (like stocks) in Roth IRAs or taxable accounts, while holding more stable investments in traditional accounts due to potential taxes on capital gains.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Aim to maximize your contributions to your 401(k) (especially if thereâ€™s an employer match) and IRA/Roth IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
   
2. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account or other liquid assets before investing excess cash.

3. **Taxable Account Investments:**
   - Once you max out your retirement accounts, start using taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable distributions.

4. **Periodic Review:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment strategy based on your financial situation, tax laws, and market changes.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 40%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30%

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs, goals, and circumstances.
