The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify based on income.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, any additional savings can be directed toward taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility with your investments and withdrawals.

4. **Consider your tax situation**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA may be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect your tax rate to increase, a Roth may make more sense.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that the investments in these accounts are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular review**: Revisit your distribution strategy annually or after major life changes (like a new job or family addition) to ensure it aligns with your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
