It's great that you're considering how to best allocate your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts! Here's a general approach to help you think about it:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. It's great for long-term growth if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: You can choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice should depend on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for investments you might need access to in the near term. Keep in mind that capital gains taxes apply on withdrawals.

3. **Understand Asset Location**: 
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes.
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like stocks) can be held in taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains tax rates are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio in each account type, considering your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market conditions.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**: As market conditions change, your asset allocation can drift. Rebalancing helps ensure you stay aligned with your investment goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about what's best for your particular situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

By effectively distributing your assets across these accounts, you'll be able to optimize your tax situation and enhance your long-term growth potential.
