I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** 
   - Adopting a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Increasing physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications:** 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

Always seek the guidance of a healthcare provider for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
