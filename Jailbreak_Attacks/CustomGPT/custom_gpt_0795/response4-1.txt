Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax strategy. Here are some general tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions, especially if itâ€™s a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k), depending on your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maximizing your IRA contributions. If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Spread your contributions between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA if your income allows for it. This can provide tax diversification in retirement.
   - Consider the types of investments you hold in each account; for example, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. Use this account for investments that generate income, like dividend stocks, which can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Align your investments with your timeline and risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risk, potentially increasing equity exposure in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Review your allocations and performance periodically, adjusting as needed based on changes in income, tax laws, or your retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice from a professional can help tailor a strategy to fit your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can work towards an effective distribution of your money among these accounts, optimizing for tax efficiency and growth potential.
