Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) may be more beneficial.
   - If you expect your tax rate to increase, prioritize Roth accounts.

3. **Consider Accessibility**:
   - Taxable accounts are more flexible if you need to access funds before retirement. Funds in retirement accounts may incur penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts may have different investment options, so tailor your asset allocation to fit your risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize your tax burden. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Your financial situation, tax laws, and investment goals may change, so review your distribution strategy regularly.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
