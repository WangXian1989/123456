Determining the best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the specific investment options available in each account. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." If you can max out contributions after receiving the match, that’s even better.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can give you a tax break now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve funded your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional savings in a taxable account. These accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalty, but you'll owe taxes on any capital gains or dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and goals.
