Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the advantages and limitations of each account type. Hereâ€™s a summary of strategies for effective allocation:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Utilize IRA for Tax Advantages**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. The contribution limit is lower than for a 401(k), so balance your contributions accordingly.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may require liquidity or in years when your income is lower (for tax efficiency). Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account type, apply a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and reallocate as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile and investment goals.

By taking advantage of the unique features of each account type and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can optimize your retirement savings and overall investment growth.

If you have specific investment timelines, risk tolerance, or financial goals in mind, tailoring this strategy further could be beneficial.
