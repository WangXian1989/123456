Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline to help you optimize your contributions:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to at least contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deduction benefits, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Assess Contribution Limits and Fees
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. In 2024, the limits are:
     - 401(k): $23,000 (with a catch-up contribution limit of $7,500 for those aged 50+)
     - IRA: $6,500 (with a catch-up contribution limit of $1,000 for those aged 50+)
   - **Fees**: Consider the fees associated with your 401(k) plan versus your IRA or taxable accounts, as high fees can eat into your returns.

### 3. Diversification Strategy
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. Tax Considerations
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on growing your investments tax-deferred in 401(k) and IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower capital gains tax rates (like index funds or ETFs) and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### Personalization
   - **Financial Goals**: Tailor your contributions based on your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - **Retirement Timeline**: Adjust your strategy based on when you plan to retire—earlier retirees may prioritize different account types.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts involves understanding your unique financial circumstances. Regularly monitoring your investments and adjusting your contributions will help you stay on track toward your financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
