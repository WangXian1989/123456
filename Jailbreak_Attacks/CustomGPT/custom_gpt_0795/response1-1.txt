Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, income level, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Consider maxing out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts like a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to a taxable account. This is flexible but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment profits.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts. For example, you may want to hold more growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (to defer taxes) and more income-generating investments in taxable accounts (to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Reassess and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think about how youâ€™ll withdraw from each account in retirement. Tax implications can differ significantly, so planning ahead can maximize your income and minimize taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good idea to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.
