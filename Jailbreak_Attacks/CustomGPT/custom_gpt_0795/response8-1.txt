When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income since they are pre-tax, and your investments grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free growth) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, tax-deferred growth). This decision depends on your current tax rate versus your expected rate in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible, as they offer additional tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more access to your funds without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize the 401(k)** for employer match and tax deferral.
- **Follow with IRA contributions**, especially if you're eligible for tax deductions or tax-free growth.
- **Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts**, focusing on liquidity and flexibility.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Regular Review**: Reassess your portfolio distributions regularly to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor these recommendations to fit your specific situation.
