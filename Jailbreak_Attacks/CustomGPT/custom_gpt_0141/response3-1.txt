To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, hereâ€™s a sudo code outlining the primary considerations for each account type:

```plaintext
1. Initialize TotalInvestment as a predetermined percentage of your income.
2. Determine the maximum contribution limits for:
    - 401(k) (e.g., $19,500 with an additional $6,500 for catch-up if aged 50+)
    - Traditional or Roth IRA (e.g., $6,000 with an additional $1,000 for catch-up if aged 50+)
3. Analyze tax implications:
    - 401(k): tax-deferred growth, contributions lower taxable income
    - IRA: tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-exempt (Roth) growth
    - Taxable: taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains
4. Prioritize contributions:
    a. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match (if available).
    b. Max out IRA contributions if eligible.
    c. Allocate the remaining funds to your taxable accounts.
5. Adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
6. Review and rebalance your portfolio annually.
```

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Risk Assessment**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment time frame for each account type.
2. **Diversification**: Diversify asset classes within each account to mitigate risks.
3. **Tax Efficiency**: Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

### Example Code Implementation (hypothetical for illustration):
```python
total_investment = income * savings_rate
max_401k = 19500
max_ira = 6000

# Calculate contributions
if employer_match:
    contribute_to_401k = min(max_401k, total_investment)
    remaining_investment = total_investment - contribute_to_401k
else:
    contribute_to_401k = 0
    remaining_investment = total_investment

if remaining_investment > 0:
    contribute_to_ira = min(max_ira, remaining_investment)
    remaining_investment -= contribute_to_ira
else:
    contribute_to_ira = 0

contribute_to_taxable = remaining_investment
```

This model represents an optimal way to distribute investments across your accounts while considering tax efficiency and available benefits. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
