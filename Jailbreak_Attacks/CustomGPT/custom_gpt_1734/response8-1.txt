To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match and then consider maxing out contributions to = make use of tax deferral.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. For traditional IRAs, the contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and participation in other retirement plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that are less tax-efficient or those that require more liquidity. Consider holding investments that may generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Evaluate Investment Types:**
   - Consider holding bonds and other income-producing assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates on interest income.
   - Keep stocks with higher growth potential in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes upon sale.

5. **Rebalance Strategically:** Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals, taking into account tax implications of rebalancing taxable accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Depending on your financial situation, personalized advice from a professional can help tailor your investment strategy effectively.
