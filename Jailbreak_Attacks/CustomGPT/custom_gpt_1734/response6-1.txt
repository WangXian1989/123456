To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits (e.g., tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Assess Contribution Limits**: Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) limit in 2023 is $22,500; IRA limit is $6,500).

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate more aggressive investments in accounts where the long-term growth potential is maximized, such as your 401(k) and IRA. Consider keeping more conservative investments in taxable accounts, which are more accessible for short-term needs.
   - **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Withdrawal Order**: Plan the order in which you will withdraw funds from these accounts in retirement, as this can affect your tax situation. Generally, it's advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k) or traditional IRA), and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRA).
