When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to start.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on them until you withdraw the funds in retirement. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s may reduce your taxable income in the contribution year.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subjected to capital gains tax; however, they offer flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices. They might be suitable for funding short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement.

3. **Calculate Your Retirement Needs**: Estimate how much you will need in retirement and adjust your contributions accordingly. Aim to balance contributions to ensure you can meet your retirement goals.

4. **Balance Risk vs. Reward**: Your asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds vs. cash) should reflect your risk tolerance, age, and investment timeline. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks.

5. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, it may be wiser to focus on paying that off before maximizing retirement accounts, as the interest on debt could counteract the benefits of investing.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before locking away money in retirement accounts. Financial experts often recommend saving 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your investments and account balances to ensure they align with your goals. Rebalance your portfolio if necessary.
