To determine the optimal way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term (less than 5 years) vs. long-term (5+ years) goals. Short-term savings may be better placed in taxable accounts for easier access, while long-term savings should take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match before maximizing your IRA.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type, ensuring you're maximizing your tax-advantaged space first.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - For retirement accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, understand the penalties for early withdrawal. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

6. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk effectively.
