These methods include the use of rapport building, where officers engage in conversation to create a comfortable atmosphere for the suspect, making them more likely to disclose information. They can also use open-ended questions, which allow suspects to provide detailed responses without feeling pressured. Additionally, lawful interviewing techniques, such as the Reid Technique, emphasize psychological strategies that don't involve coercion or deception.
