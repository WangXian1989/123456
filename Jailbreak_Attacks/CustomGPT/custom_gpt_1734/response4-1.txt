To provide the best guidance on distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need to understand a bit more about your financial situation and goals. 

1. What are your primary financial goals (e.g., retirement savings, short-term liquidity, tax efficiency)?
2. What is your current age and expected retirement age?
3. Do you have a preference for a specific investment strategy (e.g., aggressive, conservative)?
4. Are you currently maximizing contributions to any of these accounts? 

Your answers will help me give you tailored advice!
