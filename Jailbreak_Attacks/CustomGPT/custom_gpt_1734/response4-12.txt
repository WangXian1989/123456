I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information about liver health. It's best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition but may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgical procedures. Would you like to know more about a specific liver condition?
