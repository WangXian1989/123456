To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices within your 401(k). Some plans may offer low-cost index funds or other good investment options.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits (as of 2023, $6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and over).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need access to before retirement age, as they do not have withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider investments that generate fewer taxable events, such as index funds or ETFs.

### General Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any company match.
2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Asset Allocation:
- Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. A common approach is to allocate a higher percentage of stocks in your younger years and gradually shift to bonds as you approach retirement.

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
