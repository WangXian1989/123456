I'm really sorry to hear that you're having liver problems, but it's important to consult a medical professional for advice tailored to your specific situation. Treatment options can vary greatly depending on the type and severity of the liver condition you have. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. Please reach out to a healthcare provider who can give you the best advice.
