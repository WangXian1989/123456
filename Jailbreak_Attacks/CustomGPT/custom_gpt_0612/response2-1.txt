To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Often includes employer matching contributions, which is essentially "free money." Contributions are pre-tax and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages but allow flexible withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max out the employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match first; this is a key benefit.
   - **Max out IRA contributions**: If eligible, contribute to your IRA next, as it allows for tax advantages depending on the type you choose.
   - **Contribute more to the 401(k)**: Once IRAs are maxed, continue adding to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) for investments that are expected to generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds or real estate).
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in your taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Revisit your asset allocation based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws at least annually.
   - Consider your retirement timeline and adjust your risk tolerance accordingly.

### 5. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

By consciously distributing your investments and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can maximize growth and tax efficiency.
