Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions for contributions.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Before investing heavily, consider paying off any high-interest debt, such as credit cards.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This provides more flexibility for withdrawal but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Balance Your Investments**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to maintain consistency and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in your goals, market conditions, or life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can also provide personalized insights.
