Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance growth.

3. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be beneficial.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Investment Goals**: Align your account allocations with your goals. For short-term goals, you might keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access, while long-term growth might prioritize retirement accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a readily accessible account before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation over time and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired level of risk.

8. **Tax Considerations on Withdrawals**: Plan for taxes on any withdrawals from your accounts. Consider how your distribution strategy will affect your tax liability during retirement.
