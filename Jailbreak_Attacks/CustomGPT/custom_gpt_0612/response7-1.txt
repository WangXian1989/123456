Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a concise overview of a possible strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Since contributions are made pre-tax, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if your budget allows, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: If you qualify, consider contributing to both a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). The choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates or to maintain liquidity for short-term goals.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: This strategy involves selling investments that have lost value to offset taxes on gains from other investments.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- Start by ensuring you’re taking advantage of any employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA to take advantage of the tax benefits.
- Any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts for flexibility and potential growth.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings outside of these accounts for emergencies.
- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and financial goals across all account types.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes, especially as you approach retirement.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
