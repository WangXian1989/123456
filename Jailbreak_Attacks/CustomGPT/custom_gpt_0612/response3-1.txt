Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Check your employerâ€™s contribution limits (usually up to $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2023, with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now and taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, so withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed in the year they are realized, which can affect your cash flow.

3. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: 
   - If you are many years away from retirement, you might want to prioritize growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you approach retirement, consider reallocating some funds to conservative investments.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Match your investment choices with your comfort level with market fluctuations. Higher risk can lead to higher returns but also higher losses.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is balanced across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.

6. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers matching contributions to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to maximize that match before directing funds into IRAs or taxable accounts.

7. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a low-risk account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before focusing on long-term investments.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
1. **Maximize 401(k)** contributions up to employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (traditional or Roth based on income and tax situation).
3. **Allocate additional savings to taxable accounts** for flexibility, liquidity, and potential tax-harvesting strategies.

### Regular Review:
- Review your allocations regularly, and adjust as needed based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.
