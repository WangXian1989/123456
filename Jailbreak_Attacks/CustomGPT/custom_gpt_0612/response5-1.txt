(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions up to any employer match first, as this is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù The contribution limit is higher for 401(k)s compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Once you've taken advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you prefer tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age. Consider using these accounts for investments that generate little income, like growth stocks.

4. **Balance**: Be mindful about asset allocation. Generally, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) to reduce capital gains tax exposure, while using taxable accounts for bonds or dividend-paying stocks.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, it‚Äôs always best to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation.
