I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in some severe cases, procedures or surgery. Please ensure you discuss your situation with a medical expert for the best course of action.
