The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize funding it to at least the level of the match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages. Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds, but they may be subject to capital gains taxes. Consider keeping investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account.

4. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts for Growth**: Both 401(k) and IRA accounts provide tax benefits for long-term growth, so prioritize funding these over taxable accounts. 

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This could involve a balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Regularly Review and Reallocate**: Financial circumstances and goals can change. Regularly review your distribution and make adjustments as necessary based on your performance, market conditions, and life changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
