The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, making it a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay capital gains tax on investments sold for a profit, so consider placing investments with high turnover here.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across all accounts. This means spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

4. **Time Horizon**: Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts meant for long-term growth (like a 401(k) or IRA) where the money can grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Utilize more conservative investments in taxable accounts where you might need quicker access to funds.

5. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and evolving goals to ensure you are on track.

By balancing your contributions across these accounts, taking advantage of tax benefits, and considering your overall investment strategy, you can create an effective money distribution plan tailored to your needs.
