Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts usually depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing any employer match, focus on contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional), as they offer tax advantages. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: Once your IRA contributions are set, return to your 401(k) and contribute more, especially if your investment options are reasonable and the fees are low.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts may be invested after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Use these accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each account type. Taxable accounts may expose you to capital gains taxes, while tax-advantaged accounts can offer growth without taxes until withdrawal.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency savings fund before making major investments, as this provides financial stability in case of unexpected expenses.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Finally, regularly review your investment strategy and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

It’s also beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and situation.
