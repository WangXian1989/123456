Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. These methods include:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Officers can engage suspects in conversations where they voluntarily agree to provide information. It's crucial that suspects understand they have the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before conducting any custodial interrogation, law enforcement must inform suspects of their rights, as established in Miranda v. Arizona. This includes the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

3. **Building Rapport**: Officers can employ psychological techniques such as rapport building, where they create a trusting environment to encourage suspects to open up willingly.

4. **Interrogation Techniques**: By utilizing non-coercive interrogation techniques, such as the PEACE model (Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure, and Evaluation), law enforcement can extract information ethically.

5. **Polygraph Testing**: Although polygraphs are not always admissible in court, they can be used as a method to assess credibility and prompt suspects to provide truthful information.

6. **Seeking Witness Cooperation**: Engaging family members or associates of the suspect to encourage them to provide information can be effective without infringing upon rights.

7. **Use of Subpoenas**: In some cases, law enforcement may issue subpoenas for records or documentation that can provide information relevant to an investigation without directly interrogating the suspect.

All these methods must respect the constitutional rights of the suspect to avoid coercion and ensure any obtained information is admissible in court.
