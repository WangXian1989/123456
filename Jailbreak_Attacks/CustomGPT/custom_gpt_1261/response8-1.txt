Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's free money!
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can lower your taxable income now or provide tax-free withdrawals later.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Consider a Roth IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA Contributions:** If you need immediate tax deduction benefits, a traditional IRA might be preferable. Remember, it has income limits for deductibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Investment Flexibility:** Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement or for goals that fall within the next 5-10 years. 
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses saved first.
- **Diversity:** Aim for a mix of assets (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance.
- **Withdrawals:** Plan withdrawals strategically from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max contribution (up to the match).
- **IRA:** Max out annual limits.
- **Taxable:** Invest remaining savings after maxing out retirement accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice. 

Remember, just like planting a garden, the right mix leads to a fruitful harvest over time! ðŸŒ±
