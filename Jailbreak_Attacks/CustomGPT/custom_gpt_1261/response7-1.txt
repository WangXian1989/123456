Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a simplified approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Focus on maxing out contributions if possible, especially if your employer offers a match.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now but taxes will apply on withdrawals during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts. This is useful for money that you may need before retirement or for more flexible investment options. Be mindful of tax implications on capital gains.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Investment Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Final Tips:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal situation. 

Remember, "Patience is the key to success." ðŸŒ±
