Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k) for traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs are tax-free upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income is taxed as capital gains or ordinary income. Consider the tax-efficient investment principles here, such as holding bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance:
     - **Riskier assets** like stocks may be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts to allow tax-free growth.
     - **Bonds** may be best suited for tax-advantaged accounts to avoid the higher taxes on bond interest.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep in mind your liquidity needs. Funds in a taxable account are more accessible without penalties, unlike those in retirement accounts which may have withdrawal restrictions.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, or financial goals.

### Final Thoughts
It's wise to consult a financial advisor tailored to your situation, as they can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial landscape.
