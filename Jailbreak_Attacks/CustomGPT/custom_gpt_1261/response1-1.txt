Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for using the funds. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, consider minimizing contributions to taxable accounts, as capital gains taxes could cut into your returns. However, taxable accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to mitigate risk.
   - **Different Strategies**: Use different strategies for each account. For example, consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - **Annual Review**: Revisit your investment strategy annually to adjust for market changes, life events, or shifts in financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs and goals.

Remember, it's not just about where to put your money, but how that money can grow and work for you over time. As they say, "Small steps lead to great journeys." ðŸŒ±
