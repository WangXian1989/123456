Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing several factors: tax advantages, investment options, liquidity needs, and your financial goals. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, and funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits:** These accounts often allow you to save more than IRAs.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification:** Use IRAs to diversify your investments beyond whatâ€™s available in your 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer access to your money without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments long-term to minimize tax impact.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially to the match.**
2. **Contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.**
3. **After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for greater flexibility** and to save for goals within a 5-10 year horizon.

Consider your individual tax situation, investment preferences, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
