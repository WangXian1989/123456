Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a straightforward approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions in the contribution year.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Strategic Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Generally better for growth-oriented investments (like stocks) due to tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds or index funds) here to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Monitor and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure youâ€™re aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consider your unique circumstances, and consult a financial advisor for tailored advice. Happy investing!
