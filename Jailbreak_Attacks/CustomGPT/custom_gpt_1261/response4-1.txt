When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following points to create an optimal strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Keep this for long-term growth and consider the fund options available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for short-term goals or as an emergency fund, but youâ€™ll pay capital gains tax on any profits.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Longer-term investments should be in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Shorter-term goals can be placed in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse asset allocation in all accounts to manage risk and growth across various sectors.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes, favoring tax-advantaged accounts first.

6. **Adjust Based on Income**: Depending on your income level, you may want to prioritize which accounts to fund first. Higher earners might benefit more from maximizing 401(k) contributions.

A balanced approach tailored to your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance is key. It might also be wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
