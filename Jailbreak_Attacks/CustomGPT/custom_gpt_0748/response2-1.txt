Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account that also offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No specific tax advantages, but flexibility in withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to reduce your taxable income.
   - A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Allocate different types of investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. For example, you might want higher growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to manage capital gains.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing. This fund should be in a high-yield savings account for easy access.

### 6. **Annual Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your savings effectively.

### 7. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation and contribution strategies annually or whenever there are major life changes (job change, marriage, etc.).

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **IRA:** Max out contribution, prioritizing a Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Account:** Invest any remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth with a diversified portfolio.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, tax situation, and retirement goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
