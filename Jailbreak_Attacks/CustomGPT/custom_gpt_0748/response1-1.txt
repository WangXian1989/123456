Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contribution**: Max out any employer match first, as it's free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Tax Considerations**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or for funds you may need before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or individual stocks with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your goals.
- **Consider Fees**: Watch for high fees in any account, as they can eat into your returns.
