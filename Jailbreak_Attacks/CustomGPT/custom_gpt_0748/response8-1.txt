Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit or to the match. This reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth). 

3. **Emergency Savings**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have a 3-6 month emergency fund in a high-yield savings account.

4. **Taxable Accounts After Tax-Advantaged Options**: Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. Here, focus on investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or long-term capital gains.

5. **Rebalancing**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation, adjusting as your goals and market conditions change.

6. **Diversification**: Invest in a mix of asset classes—stocks, bonds, and real estate—across all accounts to spread risk.
