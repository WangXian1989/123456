When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Assess Tax Advantages
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Use this for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: There are traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth IRAs (tax-free growth). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t have tax advantages but offer flexibility. Invest in assets with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

### 2. Diversify Investments
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Use for investments that benefit from tax-advantaged growth, including index funds or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider stocks or ETFs for growth, but include tax-efficient investments to minimize tax impact.

### 3. Allocate Funds Strategically
   - Max out contributions to employer-matched 401(k) first to take advantage of free money.
   - Next, fund an IRA, especially if you can select investments that align with your strategy.
   - After these, invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and access to funds when needed.

### 4. Regularly Rebalance
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain desired risk levels and investment goals. 

This framework will help you utilize the unique advantages each account offers while pursuing your financial objectives.
