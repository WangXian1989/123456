I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options vary based on the specific condition and severity. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgical options like liver transplantation. It's important to get a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan from a qualified medical provider.
