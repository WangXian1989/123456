To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance to determine the proportion of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Generally, put more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - With taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. This adds liquidity for short-term goals while preserving tax efficiency.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: 15% (focused on employer match and tax-deferred growth)
- **IRA**: 20% (maximizing tax advantages)
- **Taxable Account**: 10% (for flexibility and short-term needs)

### Key Considerations:
- **Age and Retirement Goals**: Younger investors might lean more heavily into growth assets, while those nearing retirement might prioritize stability and income.
- **Current and Expected Future Income**: This will guide your decisions on which accounts to withdraw from during retirement.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize for growth, control tax liabilities, and prepare for future financial needs.
