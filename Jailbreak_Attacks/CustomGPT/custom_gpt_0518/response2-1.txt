Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50.
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount to an IRA ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50). Consider a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income in the year of the contribution. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - A Roth account (401(k) or IRA) involves post-tax contributions, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts generally have fewer tax advantages but allow for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices. Consider this for short-term or mid-term goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your investment strategy: deduce asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) and their risk levels. Often, it's wise to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (where growth can be reinvested tax-free), while more stable investments can go into taxable accounts where you might want liquidity.

4. **Diversification and Rebalancing**:
   - Ensure diversification across different accounts to manage risk effectively. Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Debt Prioritization**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider focusing on paying that down before maximizing contributions to investment accounts.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may also be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial planner to align your asset distribution strategy with your personal financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, a balanced approach tailored to your unique financial picture will serve you best.
