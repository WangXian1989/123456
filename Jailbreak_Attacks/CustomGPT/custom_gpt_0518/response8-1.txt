The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this offer. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA over taxable accounts. This is because they offer tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth (401(k), traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

3. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Options:**
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth account (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)).
   - If you expect it to be lower, a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investment Types:** Within these accounts, ensure that you have a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon for investing.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider setting aside money in taxable accounts for short-term financial goals or for money you might need access to before retirement age.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

Tailoring your contributions based on these principles can help achieve a balanced and effective strategy for your retirement savings.
