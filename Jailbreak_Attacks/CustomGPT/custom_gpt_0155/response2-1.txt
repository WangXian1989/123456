Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Take Advantage of Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, allowing for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep an eye on annual limits to maximize your contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Liquidity**: These accounts allow for withdrawals without penalties, making them useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains, which can be managed through strategic investment choices (like index funds or ETFs).

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient savings outside of these accounts for emergencies.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance. Generally, growth-oriented investments may belong in tax-advantaged accounts while bonds and conservative investments can go in taxable accounts.
   - **Tax Implications**: Keep high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities; use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually or after significant life changes.

It's often wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor an approach specific to your situation.
