Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
- **Contributions**: Maximize employer match first; it’s essentially free money.
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce taxable income; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
- **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, with taxes owed on withdrawals.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Considerations**: Evaluate your current vs. expected future tax rate to choose the right type.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: No contribution limits or penalties for withdrawals; good for short-term goals.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on assets with lower capital gains tax rates, like index funds or ETFs.

### **Optimal Strategy**
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
2. **Fund IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond retirement, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### **Asset Allocation**
- Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and age—consider more stocks when younger, shifting toward bonds as retirement nears.

### **Review Regularly**
- Periodically assess your contributions and reallocations as life circumstances and markets change.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial planner who can tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

This approach balances tax advantages with flexibility to help you grow wealth effectively.
