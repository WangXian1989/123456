I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized advice. Here are some general options that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health.
   - **Limit Alcohol:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can help prevent further liver damage.
   - **Weight Management:** Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may help manage the infection.
   - **Immunosuppressants:** For autoimmune liver diseases, these drugs can help reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function through blood tests.
   - Imaging tests like ultrasounds or CT scans for assessing liver health.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, such as liver tumors or significant damage, surgical options or even a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always make sure to discuss any treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine what is best for your specific condition.
