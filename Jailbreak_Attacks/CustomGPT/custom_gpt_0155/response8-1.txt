To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Consider this for higher income years.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you qualify, prioritize contributions here for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a balanced portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Withdraw funds from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA).

5. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity in a taxable account for emergencies, rather than relying solely on retirement accounts.

6. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and adjust your contributions accordingly.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
