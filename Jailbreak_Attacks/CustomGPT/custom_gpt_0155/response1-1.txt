To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investments here will be subject to capital gains tax when sold.

3. **Investing Strategy**:
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce taxable income (like bonds).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) for balanced risk.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund outside these accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
