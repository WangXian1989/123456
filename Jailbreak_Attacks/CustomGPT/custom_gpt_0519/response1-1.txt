Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both accounts offer tax advantages. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on contributions until retirement. Roth accounts, on the other hand, allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subjected to capital gains tax when sold. Therefore, consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in these accounts.

3. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing employer match:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing more to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k).
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, traditional accounts might be more beneficial since you'll save on taxes now.

4. **Emergency Savings First**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in your retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investment choices (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Review your overall investment strategy and allocations regularly (at least annually) and adjust based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

Each individual’s situation is unique, meaning it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the best allocation strategy for your specific needs and goals.
