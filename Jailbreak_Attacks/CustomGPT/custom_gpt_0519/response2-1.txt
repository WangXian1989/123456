The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your tax situation, investment goals, time horizon, and retirement plans. Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money".
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Since contributions are made pre-tax, your investments can grow tax-deferred. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Individual Retirement Account (IRA)**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (contributions are made post-tax). Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to increase or if you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribute to Max Limit**: If eligible, try to contribute the maximum allowed to benefit from the tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Access**: Taxable accounts provide flexibility, as you can withdraw money at any time without penalties. 
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact. Avoid frequent trading to reduce capital gains taxes.

4. **Consideration for Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and conservative investments in taxable accounts for greater tax efficiency.

5. **Regular Review and Adjust**: 
   - Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.

In general, a common strategy is to prioritize putting enough into your 401(k) to get any employer match, then maxing out an IRA, and finally contributing to taxable accounts as needed. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
