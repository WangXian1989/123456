The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed. This reduces your taxable income and allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (and getting the match), consider contributing to an IRA (either a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Keep in mind the contribution limits and tax implications for each.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, invest in taxable accounts. This can offer more flexibility and liquidity, though you may face capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Diversification & Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and adjusted for the risk you are willing to take. Your asset allocation should consider your age, investment horizon, and risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications when investing in taxable accounts. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) can minimize capital gains taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and help you develop a comprehensive strategy for distributing your investments across these accounts.
