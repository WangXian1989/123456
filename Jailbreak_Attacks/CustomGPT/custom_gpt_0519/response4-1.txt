To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages. Contributions to a 401(k) may be pre-tax or after-tax (Roth), depending on your plan, while traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible.
   - Use taxable accounts for funds that you may need in the short term or for investments that may generate taxable income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your financial goals (retirement, buying a house, etc.) and your time horizon. Long-term goals can benefit from the tax-advantaged growth in retirement accounts.
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

3. **Diversification and Liquidity**:
   - Maintain a diversified asset allocation by spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
   - Keep enough liquidity in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs, but avoid holding too much cash that could earn minimal returns.

4. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if over age 50) and for IRAs, it is $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds from these accounts in retirement. Traditional retirement accounts will be taxed as ordinary income when you withdraw funds, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if conditions are met.

In summary, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, maintain liquidity in taxable accounts, consider your specific financial goals, and always be aware of contribution limits. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
