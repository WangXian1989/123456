To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts first because they allow your investments to grow tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA Consideration**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, direct additional savings to a taxable account. This is more flexible, allowing you to withdraw funds anytime without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments based on the account type:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Invest in growth-oriented assets like stocks, as these accounts are long-term holds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly revisit your allocations across all accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Tailoring these strategies to your unique financial circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance can help you achieve optimal growth while managing your tax obligations effectively.
