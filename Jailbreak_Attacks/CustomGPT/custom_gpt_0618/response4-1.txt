The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several individual factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are general strategies for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Growth Investments:** Given that 401(k) accounts are tax-advantaged for long-term growth, consider allocating a higher percentage towards equities and growth-focused investments, especially if you're younger.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free growth). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.
   - **Diversified Portfolio:** Similar to 401(k), aim for a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** For taxable accounts, focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-free municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Hold Long-Term:** Since youâ€™ll be taxed on capital gains, consider holding investments for the long term to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term gains.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before investing heavily.
- **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced asset allocation based on your risk tolerance across all account types.
- **Regular Contributions:** Contribute regularly to each account to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your situation.

### Conclusion:
Prioritize contributions to maximize tax advantages while considering your overall investment strategy and individual tax implications. Adjust the distribution as your financial situation and goals change over time.
