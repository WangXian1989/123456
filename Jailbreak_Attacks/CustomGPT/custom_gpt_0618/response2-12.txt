1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoiding alcohol and recreational drugs.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antivirals for hepatitis (if applicable).
   - Treatments to manage symptoms and complications, such as diuretics for fluid retention.

3. **Monitoring and Supportive Care**:
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function.
   - Nutritional support or counseling.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some people find supplements like milk thistle helpful, but you should consult with your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.
