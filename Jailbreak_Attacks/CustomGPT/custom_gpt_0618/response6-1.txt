When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to keep in mind, including tax implications, contribution limits, and your overall financial goals. Here's a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Consider Tax Efficiency:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. This is beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: 
     - Hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
     - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts if you're aiming for liquidity, as they can be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 3. Diversify Your Investments:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to manage risk effectively.
   - Adjust the allocation based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and specific financial goals.

### 4. Review and Adjust Regularly:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and adjust the distribution as your financial situation, market conditions, or tax laws change.

### Summary:
   - **Maximize contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **Invest tax-efficiently** in taxable accounts.
   - **Maintain diversification** and regularly review your strategy to align with your goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
