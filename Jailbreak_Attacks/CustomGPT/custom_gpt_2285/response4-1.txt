To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRAs) for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments. Opt for a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and funds based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts for flexibility, like short-term goals or emergency funds. 

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - **Consider Future Taxes**: Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.
   - **Stay Within Tax Brackets**: Be mindful of your tax bracket when withdrawing funds to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-Intensive Investments**: Place high-turnover investments or those that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Position investments with lower turnover and long-term capital gains in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations across accounts to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

This strategy aims to optimize tax efficiency and align with your investment objectives.
