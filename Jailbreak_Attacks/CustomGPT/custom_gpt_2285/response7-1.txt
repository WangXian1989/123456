To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Then, prioritize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth IRAs) until withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on profits and can also have dividends taxed, so consider these for investments with lower turnover and tax-efficient strategies.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize the tax impact on your income.

4. **Rebalance and Modify**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**: When you begin to take withdrawals in retirement, consider the order. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation and goals.
