To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Typically tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, tax advantages vary with traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to take advantage of tax benefits, focusing on traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.
   - Hold investments likely to generate dividends or less favorable tax treatment in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified allocation across all accounts to manage risk effectively, with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and goals.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation, accounting for market movements.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement, considering tax implications (taxable first, then tax-deferred).

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions and strategically managing tax implications, you can effectively grow your wealth over time.
