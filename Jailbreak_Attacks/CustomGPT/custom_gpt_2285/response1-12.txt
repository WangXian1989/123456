I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people find benefit from certain vitamins and liver support supplements, but consult your doctor before taking any.

Always check with a healthcare professional for personalized advice!
