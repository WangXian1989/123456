To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to capture any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Current Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket:** Evaluate whether you are in a higher or lower tax bracket now, which may influence whether to choose traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) contributions.
   - **Future Projections:** Consider expected income in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, prioritize Roth accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investmentsâ€”stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that may generate higher capital gains, such as index funds or ETFs, to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Annual Review:** Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired allocation.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy Awareness**
   - **Sequence of Withdrawals:** In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

By strategically allocating your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your overall financial growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
