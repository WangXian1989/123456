Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize employer match**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider tax benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Depending on your tax bracket, a Roth IRA (taxed now, tax-free withdrawals) may be beneficial, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for under age 50, $7,500 for 50 and older for 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts are great for short-term goals or emergencies since they allow quicker access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax efficiency**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in cash or equivalents before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes to manage risk.
- **Balanced Approach**: Consider using a percentage-based allocation strategy (e.g., 60% in tax-advantaged accounts, 40% in taxable accounts) that can be adjusted based on your life stage and financial goals.

### **Regular Reviews**
- Conduct regular financial check-ups to adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in your finances, job situation, or market conditions.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

This balanced approach will help you optimize your investments and ensure you're planning effectively for retirement.
