To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Debt Assessment**: Pay off high-interest debt first, as that may offer a better return on your investment than savings accounts or taxed investments.

3. **Max Out IRA**: If you can afford to, max out your IRA contributions next. This allows for tax-advantaged growth.

4. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue contributing to the 401(k) until you meet your employer's match, then consider increasing contributions or looking into a Roth IRA if eligible.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you need liquidity or flexible access to your money.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments in all accounts while considering tax implications. Use tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation, goals, and the performance of each account to adjust contributions as necessary.

This strategy balances maximizing tax advantages and ensuring liquidity as needed.
