To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties (but be mindful of taxes on gains).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Typically, stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and consider a mix of both.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so strategically place investments with high potential for appreciation in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review your distributions and adjust based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
