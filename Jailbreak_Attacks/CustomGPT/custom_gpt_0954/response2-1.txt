Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here up to the match limit. This is essentially "free money." Consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially if your 401(k) has a good range of investment options with low fees.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA next, choosing between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxable withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions but tax-free withdrawals). A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility and liquidity, allowing for access to funds without penalty.

**General Strategy**:
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
- Diversify investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and timeline.
- Reassess your allocation regularly to align with changing market conditions and personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
