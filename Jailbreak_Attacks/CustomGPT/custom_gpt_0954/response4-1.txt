Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing any employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you're eligible. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Funds in a taxable account are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments. In contrast, growth in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) is tax-deferred. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, it might make sense to prioritize tax-deferred accounts.

4. **Diversification of Tax Treatment**: Having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts can offer flexibility in retirement. This way, you can manage your tax liability by choosing which account to withdraw from based on your tax situation in retirement.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so itâ€™s essential to review and adjust your contributions periodically.

6. **Invest Accordingly**: Finally, ensure that your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
