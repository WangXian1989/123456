To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Start with your 401(k) and IRA, especially if they offer employer matching contributions or tax deductions. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match in your 401(k) first, as itâ€™s essentially "free money." After that, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Allocate funds based on your investment goals. Long-term goals (like retirement) can be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound without immediate tax implications. For shorter-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for liquid assets and may offer favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Each account type can hold different asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Continuously monitor and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level, especially as you approach retirement age.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor strategies to your specific situation.
