I'm really sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized evaluation, but some common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Incorporating a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function and detect any worsening of the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery or transplantation may be considered.

Make sure to discuss all options with your healthcare provider to determine the best approach for your situation.
