To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA before allocating funds to taxable accounts. This reduces your taxable income now.
   - **Taxable Account for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains or frequent trading. This enables easier access to funds without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **401(k)**: Best for long-term growth; typically a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional or Roth, which affects tax implications. Depending on your income level, favor Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using these for investment opportunities that you may want to cash out in the short to medium term. 

Make sure to regularly reassess your allocation based on changes in income, market conditions, and retirement goals.
