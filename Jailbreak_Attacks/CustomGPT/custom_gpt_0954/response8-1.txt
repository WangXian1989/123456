Balancing contributions among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investments and tax efficiency. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Once you’re maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After contributing to your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This often has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need before retirement or for investments that might generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This could include stocks or mutual funds that have favorable tax treatment.

5. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to work with a professional to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By following this strategy, you can potentially maximize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
