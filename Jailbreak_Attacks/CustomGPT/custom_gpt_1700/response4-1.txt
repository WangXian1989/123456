Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a simple approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax advantages, but Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect higher taxes in the future.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**: 
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term investments. Target-date funds or a mix of stocks and bonds based on your retirement timeline can be good options.
   - In your IRA, consider investments that may produce tax-free growth, like stocks or index funds.
   - Taxable accounts are good for investments you may need access to before retirement. Favor investments with lower turnover and tax-efficient funds.

4. **Balance Contributions**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, prioritize funding a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA for the tax deduction. Once those are fully funded, return to your 401(k) or invest in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Revisit your allocation regularly (at least annually) to adjust for changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

This strategy should align with your overall financial situation and goals.
