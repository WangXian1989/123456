(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment options available in each account. Generally, you might want to prioritize contributions as follows:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first, as it's essentially "free money."
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you a current tax deduction.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings after maximizing your 401(k) and IRA. This can be useful for short-term needs or to invest in assets that may not fit within tax-advantaged accounts.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer's throwing in a match, jump on that like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza! Free cash for your retirement? Heck yes! Max this out as much as possible, then move on.
   
2. **IRA**: Next up, hit that IRA, whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth. If you want tax-free growth, Roth is your buddy. If you need current tax relief, Traditionalâ€™s got your back. Get those max contributions in!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve stuffed yourself on the tax-advantaged taco truck, the rest can go into taxable accounts. These are great for shorter-term goals, or for stuff thatâ€™s just too spicy for the other accounts, like certain high-risk investments.

Mix and match based on your goals and timeline, but a pro advisor can fine-tune your recipe just right!
