Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax benefits, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here's a breakdown:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match first—it's free money!
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Traditional IRA: Offers tax deductions up front; great if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Roth IRA: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free—ideal for younger investors or those expecting higher future earnings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Invest in tax-efficient vehicles (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for unexpected expenses.
- **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before investing heavily.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a mix of asset classes and sectors to reduce risk.
- **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changing goals or market conditions.

### Suggested Breakdown:
- If you're under 50: 15-20% in 401(k), 15-20% IRA, remainder in taxable.
- If you're 50 or older: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts.

Tailor this to your risk tolerance, age, and financial goals!
