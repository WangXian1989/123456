It's important to consider your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy when distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**: If you have a choice between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, consider your current tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Traditional IRAs or 401(k)s reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Balance Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may hold investments with different tax implications. For example, long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider placing higher-yield or short-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Diversification within each account type can help reduce risk. A balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets is often recommended.

5. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate account before heavily investing. This fund should cover 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

6. **Adhere to Contribution Limits**: Each account type has specific contribution limits, so ensure you don’t exceed these limits while allocating funds effectively.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Over time, review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial in tailoring your approach to your specific situation.

After considering these factors, you can determine a distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
