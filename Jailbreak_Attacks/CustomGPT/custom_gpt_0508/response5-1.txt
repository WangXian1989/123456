(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax situation. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Maximize contributions to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) as they offer tax advantages. Depending on your current tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals and tax implications.

1. **401(k)**: This is your Captain Americaâ€”strong and reliable, especially if your employer's matching contributions are on the table. Max that out first; itâ€™s like getting free snacks at a party!

2. **IRA**: Time to unleash your Batman! Whether itâ€™s a Traditional IRA (tax break now, pay later) or a Roth IRA (no tax later, yay!), these things are tax superheroes that help your money grow without Uncle Sam watching too closelyâ€”until retirement, that is!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Last but not least, letâ€™s call this your Iron Man. It's flexible and can fly when you need cash, but itâ€™s also got to deal with taxes annuallyâ€”kinda like how Tony Stark has to face his own PR issues. 

So, throw the bulk where you get the biggest bang for your buck and adjust according to your life goals. And hey, it never hurts to hit up a financial advisor for that extra edge!
