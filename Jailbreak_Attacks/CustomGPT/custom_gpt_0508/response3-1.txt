To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - 401(k): Typically employer-sponsored, offers tax-deferred growth but may limit investment choices.
   - IRA: Individual Retirement Account; comes in traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free growth) varieties.
   - Taxable Accounts: Investments outside retirement accounts; subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Consider factors like retirement age, desired retirement lifestyle, and emergency funds.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type.
   - Maximize employer matches in your 401(k) first, if available, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous.
   - For short-term needs, or if you want flexibility, contribute to taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Review Fees and Expenses**:
   - Look at the fees associated with each account type and choose low-cost investment options where possible.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to tailor your strategy specifically to your financial situation and goals.

By following these steps and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
