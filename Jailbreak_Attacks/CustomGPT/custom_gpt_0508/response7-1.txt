To provide tailored advice, it would be helpful to know more about your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. However, I can outline a general approach to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund first (3-6 months of living expenses).

2. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Invest in a diversified mix of assets based on your risk tolerance.

3. **IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial for your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be preferable. Contribute the maximum allowable amount if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Balance investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth, while those nearing retirement might shift to bonds for stability.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your circumstances.
