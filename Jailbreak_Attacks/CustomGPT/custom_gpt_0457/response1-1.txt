To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and a great place to start.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your growth over time.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment strategy. Typically, you might want to hold bonds in your taxable account (which generate interest taxed at your ordinary rate) and let stocks grow tax-deferred in your 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Investment Horizon**: If you have a longer time horizon, focus on growth-oriented investments in your retirement accounts and consider holding more stable, income-producing assets in your taxable account to balance risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw these funds in retirement. Having a mix can give you flexibility depending on your income needs and tax situation at withdrawal time.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: To tailor the strategy to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice. 

Diversification is key, so keep an eye on overall asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
