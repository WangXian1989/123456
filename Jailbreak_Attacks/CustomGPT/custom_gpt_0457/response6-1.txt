To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy tailored to your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any company match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions, utilizing pre-tax dollars which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you have maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, direct excess funds to a taxable account. This offers more liquidity and flexibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.
   - Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liability.

### Considerations:
- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments within each account type, focusing on a mix of equities and fixed income in line with your risk tolerance.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your future withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes in retirement. Typically, funds from taxable accounts are withdrawn first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Ultimately, your asset allocation should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
