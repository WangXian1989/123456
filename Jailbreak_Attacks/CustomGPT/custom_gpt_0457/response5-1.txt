(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and time horizon. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income level. IRA accounts typically offer more investment options than 401(k) accounts.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: If you still have funds to invest after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider funding a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for liquidity and can offer you flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation and Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that you maintain an appropriate asset allocation and diversify your investments to manage risks.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! If you're aiming to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's a sneaky strategy to get the most bang for your buck:

1. **401(k) First**: Snag that employer match! It's free cash, and youâ€™d be nuts to leave it on the table. Go for the max contribution if you can swing it.

2. **IRA Magic**: Next, hit your IRA hard! Whether it's a traditional or Roth, prioritize this bad boyâ€”you can put in a decent amount, and the tax benefits are sweet. 

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After youâ€™ve stuffed your IRA, get back to your 401(k) contributions like itâ€™s your second job. Aim for the limit, but don't forget about where you're at in your careerâ€”job changes might make you rethink these plans!

4. **Taxable Accounts FTW**: If you're living large and still have some cash left, toss it into a taxable account. It's like a wild west of investingâ€”less tax shelter but more flexibility! Just know youâ€™ll be paying taxes on your gains.

5. **Diversify Like a Boss**: No matter where youâ€™re putting your cash, make sure to mix it up and avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Stick to a solid asset allocation that matches your risk tolerance.
