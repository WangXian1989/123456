To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Retirement savings will typically prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs can provide pre-tax contributions (taxed upon withdrawal), while Roth IRAs allow for post-tax contributions (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds here are subject to capital gains tax on any earnings. They provide flexibility but lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for your highest-growth investments (like stocks) since the growth is either tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency, as interest income is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, in 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500, and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with catch-up contributions available for those over 50).

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market performance, life changes, or shifts in your investment strategy.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**: If you're unsure about your optimum strategy, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your situation.

By balancing your investments across these accounts according to your financial goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance, you can create a well-rounded portfolio.
