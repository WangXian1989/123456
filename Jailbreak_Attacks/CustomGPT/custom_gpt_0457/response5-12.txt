If it's something like fatty liver disease, you might just need to change up your diet, kick the junk food to the curb, and hit the gym. If you're dealing with hepatitis, the doc might put you on some antiviral meds to kick that virus out of your system. Just remember, if things get serious and that liver is on its last leg, a transplant could be your best bet. But hey, don't just take my word for it â€“ make sure you chat with a healthcare pro who knows their stuff!
