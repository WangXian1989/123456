Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, so you don't pay taxes on your earnings until withdrawal. Consider putting higher tax-bracket funds here.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deferral, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, contribute to a Roth IRA.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider the purpose of each account. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - For short-term goals, use a taxable account for greater flexibility, as funds can be accessed without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from each account type to minimize taxes in retirement.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
