Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth). Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains and income taxes.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) for higher income years to lower your taxable income.
   - Use Roth IRAs for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Favor stocks in tax-advantaged accounts; bonds can be held in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability on interest.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Balance stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) spread across all accounts to manage risk.

### 6. **Regular Contributions**
   - Establish automatic contributions to maintain consistency and benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

### 7. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review and adjust allocations at least annually to maintain alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Conclusion
A common strategy might include maxing out your 401(k) up to the employer match first, then contributing to an IRA, and finally utilizing taxable accounts for additional investments. Tailor your approach based on your specific financial situation and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
