Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to maximize that match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, focusing on tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
  
3. **Diversify Assets**: Ensure a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities based on your risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors can take on more risk compared to those closer to retirement.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Choose investments with lower capital gains distributions and consider tax-efficient funds.

5. **Adjust Based on Income**: If your income fluctuates or you anticipate tax changes, adjust your contributions strategically—prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts during higher-income years.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Ongoing Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changing financial situations, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
