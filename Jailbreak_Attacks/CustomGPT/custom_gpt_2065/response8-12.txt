It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or other medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies help monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, such as end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

Always discuss your specific situation and options with a healthcare provider.
