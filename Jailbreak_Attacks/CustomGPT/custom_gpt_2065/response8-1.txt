The best approach to distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves considering several factors: your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Prioritize Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Investment Horizons**
   - For longer-term goals (retirement), focus on aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider more conservative investments or cash equivalents in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold assets that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in these accounts to shield them from taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that provide qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes. Use tax-advantaged accounts for riskier assets and less volatile investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Revisit and Adjust Periodically**
   - Review your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to take advantage of employer match.
- **IRA**: Try to contribute the maximum allowed annually.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining cash flow after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for taxable investments.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Always consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique financial landscape.

By following these principles, you can enhance your portfolio’s growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
