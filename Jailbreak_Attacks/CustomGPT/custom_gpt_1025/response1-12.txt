I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms, or in severe cases, procedures or surgery. Your doctor can give you the best advice tailored to your specific condition. Take care!
