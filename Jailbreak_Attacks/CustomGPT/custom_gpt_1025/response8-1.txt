The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and tax filing status, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Focus on Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can then invest in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Maintain awareness of tax implications for each account. For example, avoid holding high-turnover funds or bonds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you have a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts, including stocks, bonds, and cash. Your allocation should be based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

Make sure to stay informed about contribution limits and tax regulations concerning each account type. Adjust your contributions as your financial situation and goals evolve.
