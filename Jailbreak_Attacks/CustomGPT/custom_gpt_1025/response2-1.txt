The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing enough to take advantage of tax benefits, especially if your contributions are pre-tax.

2. **IRA** (Traditional or Roth):
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - Use a Traditional IRA if you need tax deductions now and expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for investments that are not tax-advantaged, such as stocks or mutual funds that you may not plan to hold long-term.
   - Consider the tax implications of your investments; prefer long-term capital gains and tax-efficient funds.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to accounts based on employer matches and tax implications.
- Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance across all three account types.
- Reassess your allocations regularly to align with changing financial goals or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
