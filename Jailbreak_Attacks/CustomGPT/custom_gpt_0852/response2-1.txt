Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After securing the match, increase contributions to your 401(k). It has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for goals that require access to funds before retirement or for investments not suitable for retirement accounts. 

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts. Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Reassess and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

This strategy helps balance growth potential with tax efficiency, aligning with both short-term and long-term financial goals.
