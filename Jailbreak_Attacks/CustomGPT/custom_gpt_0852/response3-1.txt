Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Many individuals benefit from contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified distributions are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments can incur capital gains taxes, so use these for shorter-term goals or after-tax savings.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes. This helps manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Fees**: Be aware of the associated fees with each account type, as high fees can erode returns over time.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before contributing heavily to retirement accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can also be beneficial.
