To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; otherwise, focus on a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

### 2. **Allocate Based on Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need soon. This allows for easier access without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for investments intended for retirement, as they benefit from compounding without immediate tax impact.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Maintain tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Keep higher-risk or higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to maximize potential returns over time.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income
- **IRA**: Max out annual limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually to align with changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Implementing these strategies can help optimize your investment growth while minimizing taxes. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
