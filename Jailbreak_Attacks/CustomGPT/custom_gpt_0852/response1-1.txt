Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. 

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Stay within annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older for 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more liquidity and don't have withdrawal penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider using tax-efficient investments like index funds.

### 4. **General Strategy**
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have savings set aside outside of these accounts for short-term needs.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 5. **Consult a Professional**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions based on tax implications and your financial strategy will help you grow your savings effectively.
