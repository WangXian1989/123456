I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms and reduce inflammation.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Weight management, a balanced diet, and regular exercise can significantly improve liver health. Avoiding alcohol and certain medications that strain the liver is also recommended.

3. **Nutritional Support**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help support liver function. Some may benefit from specific supplements, but consult a doctor before starting any.

4. **Monitoring and Follow-ups**: Regular check-ups and blood tests are essential to monitor liver function and assess the effectiveness of treatments.

5. **Advanced Treatments**: For severe conditions, options like antiviral therapy, liver transplantation, or procedures to reduce pressure in the veins leading to the liver might be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance tailored to your specific condition.
