Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here up to the limit, especially if you receive an employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you’re over the income limits for IRA contributions.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, ensure a diverse mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Reassess Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.

If you're uncertain about specific amounts or investment choices, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
