Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match for 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Balance 401(k) and IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your match, split additional contributions between your 401(k) and IRA based on fees, investment options, and your tax strategy.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) or for funds you'll need access to before retirement age.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Roth accounts and long-term capital gains from taxable accounts have different tax treatments.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Your Goals**:
   - If you're saving for short-term goals (like a home), you may want a higher percentage in taxable accounts. For long-term growth (retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your investment strategy.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal financial situation.
