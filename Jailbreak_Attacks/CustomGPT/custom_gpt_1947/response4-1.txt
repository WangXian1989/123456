Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out your IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Reassess 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023; $30,000 if you're 50+). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This flexibility allows for varied investment strategies while managing capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Goals**: Your allocation might also depend on your financial goals (retirement, short-term savings, etc.), risk tolerance, and expected time horizon. 

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that within each account type, you are diversifying your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and shifts in market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
