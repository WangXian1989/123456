Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After the IRA, focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit). Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can save you on taxes.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility. Use these for goals that might come before retirement or if you need access to funds without penalties.

5. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It’s often helpful to speak with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your overall financial plan and current market conditions.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investments while considering taxes and accessibility.
