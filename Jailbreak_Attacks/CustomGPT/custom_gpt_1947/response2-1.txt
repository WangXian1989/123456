To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income job, contribute up to the maximum limit (for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50+). This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if 50+).

3. **Allocate Funds Based on Goals**:
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term growth, especially if you have a diversified investment strategy.
   - Use IRAs to either secure tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This is ideal for short-term goals or flexible access to funds.

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocation and rebalance to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor tailored to your unique financial situation.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax benefits and supports your long-term financial goals.
