To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Retirement Timeline:** Determine how soon you plan to retire. The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments should be.
   - **Tax Implications:** Understand the tax benefits of each account type, optimizing where you place your contributions.

### 2. **Contribute to Your 401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to take full advantage of any employer matching funds.
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, a beneficial strategy if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Utilize an IRA:**
   - **Tax-Free Growth:** Depending on the type (traditional vs. Roth), enjoy tax advantages that further bolster your retirement savings.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits and plan accordingly.

### 4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Maintain liquidity for short-term goals or unexpected expenses. Taxable accounts are ideal for funds you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Choose investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liability.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust allocations periodically to maintain your target risk level.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize contributions** to your 401(k) for matching, then to an IRA for additional tax advantages, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Monitor and adjust your strategy** as your financial situation and market conditions evolve. 

Engaging with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific circumstances.
