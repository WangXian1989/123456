Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your income, goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

### General Guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax benefits. 
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you've contributed to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for greater flexibility, liquidity, and potential capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, stocks have higher potential returns (and risks), while bonds are more stable.
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes.

### Example Distribution Approach:

- **401(k):** Max out up to the employer match (e.g., 5-10% of your salary).
- **IRA:** Contribute the annual limit ($6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining funds (after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts) based on your risk profile.

### Final Considerations:

- **Tax Efficiency:** Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Annually:** Adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Seek Professional Advice:
Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
