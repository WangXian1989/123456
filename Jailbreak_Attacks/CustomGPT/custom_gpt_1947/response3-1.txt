Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Once you’ve funded your IRA, increase your contributions to the 401(k) to the maximum allowable limit. This also provides tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve met your 401(k) and IRA limits, consider putting excess funds into taxable accounts. This is useful for flexibility, as withdrawals are not penalized like retirement accounts.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of your tax situation. For instance, holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts can be more tax-efficient.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation stays aligned with your risk tolerance.
