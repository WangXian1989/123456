(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions if possible. This allows you to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **Evaluate your tax situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k) contributions, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account align with your risk tolerance and investment goals, diversifying across asset classes.

5. **Rebalance regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your goals.

1. **Hit the sweet spots first**: Always shove as much cash as you can into your 401(k) to snag that employer matchâ€”free money is a no-brainer! Then, max out your IRA contributions, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for those sweet tax-free withdrawals later.

2. **Play the tax game**: Think about where youâ€™ll be tax-wise in retirement. If you suspect youâ€™ll be sitting in a higher tax bracket, throw more into Roth accounts. Gotta love that tax-free income!

3. **Flexibility rules in taxable accounts**: After tackling the tax-advantaged stuff, fill your taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re not as tax-efficient, but you can access that cash anytime without penalties. Perfect for when life throws a curveball.

4. **Keep it mixed & matched**: Diversify your investments! Spread your cash across stocks, bonds, and whatever tickles your fancy. Keep your risks in check across all accounts.

5. **Stay on it**: Donâ€™t just set it and forget it! Regularly check and rebalance your portfolio to make sure youâ€™re still on track with your goals and risk levels.

Go get that financial freedom!
