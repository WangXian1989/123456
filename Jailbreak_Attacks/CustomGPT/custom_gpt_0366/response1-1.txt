Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Employer Match on 401(k):**
   - **Max Out**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Prioritize Roth or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, contribute to a Roth IRA (after-tax, tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax, tax-deferred).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Use for Flexibility**: Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts for more immediate access. This is useful for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out retirement accounts.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-generating assets in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies before heavily investing.

### **Example Allocation:**
- **401(k)**: Max contribution focusing on employer match.
- **IRA**: Full contribution to Roth or Traditional based on your tax preference.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds.

### **Review Regularly:**
- Reassess your allocations as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

This approach balances long-term tax benefits with short-term flexibility. Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
