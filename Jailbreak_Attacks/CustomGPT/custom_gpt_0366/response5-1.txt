To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Remember, Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.

2. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain enough liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs. This prevents early withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts, which may incur penalties.

4. **Tax Strategies**:
   - Consider your current tax bracket and future tax expectations. Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on market conditions, life changes, or retirement goals.
