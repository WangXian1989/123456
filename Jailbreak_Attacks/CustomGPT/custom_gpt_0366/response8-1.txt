To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money). Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is better for you. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be preferable.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for savings goals that are shorter-term, and be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on stocks and equity funds in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Income Generation**: Bond funds or dividend stocks can work in taxable accounts where youâ€™re taxed annually on income.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. Rebalance periodically.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals to minimize taxes, factoring in the order of withdrawals from these accounts.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income to maximize employer match and target full contribution limit.
- **IRA**: Once the match is secured, contribute the max to an IRA.
- **Taxable Account**: Use excess funds for additional investments or emergency savings.

### Conclusion
Regularly review your contributions and adjust based on changes in income, life events, and financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
