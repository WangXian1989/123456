Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Your 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket. 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed, tax-free withdrawals (if rules are followed).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for:
     - **Flexibility**: Withdraw anytime without penalties.
     - **Investment Options**: Can invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.

### 4. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust investments based on your risk comfort and timeline.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-tax assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Summary
- Prioritize employer match in 401(k).
- Max out IRA contributions.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility.
