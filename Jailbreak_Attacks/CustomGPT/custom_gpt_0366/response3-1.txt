Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit first. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket. 
   - **401(k)**: If you can, continue adding to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investments in taxable accounts may be beneficial for short-term goals or as an additional income source. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Annually**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in income, or life circumstances.

### Summary of a Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out up to employer match, then consider further contributions.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the max limit based on eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds needed in the near term or to diversify.

### Additional Tips
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
- Consider your liquidity needs and future tax implications in your strategy.

By tailoring these strategies to your needs, you can optimize your investment approach.
