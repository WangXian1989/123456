Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for short-term goals or if you expect to need the money before retirement. Interest from these accounts is taxed at ordinary income rates, but long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Higher Growth Investments**: Consider placing these in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., stocks, mutual funds) to maximize tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Bonds**: If investing in taxable accounts, consider municipal bonds, which may offer tax benefits.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced allocation across all accounts to minimize risk and optimize returns regardless of account type.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for the tax implications of withdrawals in retirement. Typically, draw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to maximize allowable limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds for short- to medium-term goals.

### 6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocation annually based on changing life circumstances, goals, and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific situation.
