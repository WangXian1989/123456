Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Tax-Deductible Traditional IRA:** If your income exceeds Roth IRA limits, this might be a better option for immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for flexibility and access to funds before retirement.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that are tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations yearly or when your financial situation changes.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.

This strategy balances growth potential with tax efficiency over the long term.
