To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before funding taxable accounts, as these offer tax benefits.
- **Roth IRA Benefits:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **401(k) Contributions:** Max out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching; take full advantage of this benefit.
- **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to an IRA. Be mindful of income limits for traditional or Roth IRAs.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where taxes aren't immediately due.
- **Income-Generating Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to utilize lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy
- **Order of Withdrawals:** In retirement, systematically withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to minimize taxes.

### Summary
- **Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first.**
- **Consider your withdrawal strategy for retirement.**

Adjust your strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation for optimal results. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice.
