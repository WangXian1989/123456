I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol is crucial.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups with blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Treat Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
