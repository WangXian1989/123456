1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol is critical.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Possible Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or surgery may be needed.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may benefit from supplements or herbal remedies, but always discuss with a doctor first to avoid interactions.

Always consult with your healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your specific situation.
