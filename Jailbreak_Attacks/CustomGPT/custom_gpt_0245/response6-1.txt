To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out a traditional or Roth IRA for its tax benefits (consider income limits for Roth contributions).

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of equity and bond funds based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Similar allocation; consider ways to complement your 401(k) investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawals and Taxes**
   - **Timing Withdrawals**: Use taxable accounts for short-term needs to keep your tax-advantaged accounts growing.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of each account type when planning withdrawals.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes.
