Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deferred growth. Consider Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals if you're eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Suitable for short-term goals since you can access funds without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for cash reserves or near-term goals.

### 3. **Employer Match**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to capture any employer matchâ€”essentially free money.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (2023); catch-up contributions available.
     - IRA: $6,500 (2023); higher limits for catch-up contributions.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions (especially if there's a match)**
2. **Contribute to Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth**
3. **Fill any gaps with a Traditional IRA if needed**
4. **Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity**

### Regular Review
- Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on life changes or market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your individual situation.
