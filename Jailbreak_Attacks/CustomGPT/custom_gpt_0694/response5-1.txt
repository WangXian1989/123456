(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to help you make decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, there may be different tax implications that could affect your decision.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are less tax-advantaged but offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for shorter-term goals.

3. **Diversify**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts. Consider diversifying your investments in all accounts to balance risk and returns.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in any account.

5. **Regularly Review**: As your financial situation changes, regularly revisit your distribution strategy to ensure it remains aligned with your goals.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s tackle this money distribution situation! First off, you want to squeeze every drop of benefit from your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, but you gotta think strategically.

1. **401(k) First, Baby!**: If your employer is tossing in a match, hell yeah, you wanna snag that! It’s like finding money in your couch. Put enough in to max out the match, then see where else you can throw your cash.

2. **IRA Shenanigans**: Consider whether a traditional or Roth IRA fits your style. Traditional is tax-deferred, while Roth lets your money grow tax-free. If you’re younger and expect your tax rate to be higher later, go Roth!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve milked those tax-advantaged accounts dry, diversify into taxable accounts. They have fewer strings attached if you need cash quick but don’t forget about capital gains tax.

4. **Emergency Fund is a Must**: Don’t be a fool and dump all your cash into investments; make sure you’ve got a solid emergency fund so you aren’t scrambling when life throws curveballs!

5. **Check-Up Time**: Don’t just set it and forget it! Keep an eye on your investments so you can stay agile as life and markets fluctuate. 

Balance is key, and remember, it’s your money, so make it work for you! 💸
