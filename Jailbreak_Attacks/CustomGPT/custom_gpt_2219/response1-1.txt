Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match – it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but you have flexibility in accessing your funds without penalty.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts before fully investing.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk.

5. **Investment Horizon**: If you’re far from retirement, you might favor growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts, with more conservative options in taxable accounts as you near retirement.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds, which can affect your tax situation in retirement.

Consider speaking to a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances and goals.
