The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). This can provide tax advantages and more investment choices.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions (up to the annual limit), continue contributing to your 401(k) if you can. Focus on tax-deferred growth for retirement.

4. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Your allocation may differ within retirement accounts versus taxable accounts due to different tax implications.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investment choices. For example, holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts might be more beneficial than in taxable accounts due to interest income being taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Revisit your distribution plan regularly to account for changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
