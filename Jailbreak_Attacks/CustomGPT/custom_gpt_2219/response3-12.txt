I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle modifications (such as diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms, or therapies for underlying conditions. In severe cases, liver transplantation may be considered. Please seek medical advice for your situation.
