Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before investing heavily.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA for additional tax benefits. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Health Savings Account (HSA):** If you qualify, contribute to an HSA for triple tax advantages (tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for medical expenses).

### 4. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable account. This can provide flexibility, as there are no withdrawal penalties, and you can access your money anytime.

### 5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

### 7. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts (capital gains tax) versus those in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
A well-thought-out distribution strategy considers your unique financial situation. It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
