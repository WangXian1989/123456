Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: Contribute regularly to take advantage of market fluctuations.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose based on your current versus expected future tax bracket. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Consider maximizing your contributions to take advantage of tax benefits, especially if youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments with lower turnover and qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.
   - **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you also have liquidity for short-term needs or emergencies.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation and risk tolerance. 

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.
