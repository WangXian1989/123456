1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, increased physical activity, and weight management can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver recovery.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and detect any changes early.
