The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts**: Pay off high-interest debts before investing heavily in your accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals, and in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that the investment mix in each account aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
