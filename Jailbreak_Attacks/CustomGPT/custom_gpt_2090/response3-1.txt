Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Contributions are often pre-tax, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Consider a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Similar to your 401(k), but you may have a wider range of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, like bonds or high-yield savings, to defer taxes in your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. It’s often beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally from Roth accounts if applicable (to minimize taxes).

### 6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts to avoid withdrawing from your retirement accounts prematurely.

### 7. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary (to the match limit)
- **IRA:** Max out annual contribution (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if 50+)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest remaining savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation. They can provide personalized advice that aligns with your financial goals.
