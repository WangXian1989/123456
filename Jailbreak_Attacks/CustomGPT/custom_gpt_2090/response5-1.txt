Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth IRA). Choose based on your current and expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax rates (like long-term capital gains) or for easier access to funds without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's best to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA), to minimize taxes.

5. **Adjust Based on Age & Goals**: If you’re younger, focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts. As you get closer to retirement, consider more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By balancing the benefits of each account type, you can optimize your savings for both growth and tax efficiency.
