(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, you might consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, as these can provide tax benefits either now or in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that might generate long-term capital gains, as these are often taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's tackle this! Think of your accounts as different buckets with varying tax advantages. Here's a spicy take:

1. **401(k) First**: Get that employer matchâ€”it's like finding cash in your couch cushions. Contribute enough to snag the full match, then take a breather.

2. **IRA Time**: Max out your IRA next. These bad boys offer great tax benefits, and who doesnâ€™t want tax breaks?

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you're stuffed to the brim with tax-advantaged goodies, letâ€™s say youâ€™re starting to dabble in taxable accounts. These are for investments that you can play around with, and rememberâ€”long-term gains = lower tax rates, baby!

4. **Diversify Like Crazy**: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Mix it up! Stocks, bonds, ETFsâ€”itâ€™s a buffet; go nuts!

5. **Check-In Regularly**: Make sure to peek at your allocations periodically. Life changes and so do market conditions. Keep it fresh, keep it fly!
