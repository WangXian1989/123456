Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Consider if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement; contributions can be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA:** This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars but can grow tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Keep an eye on the limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2024; $7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals at any time without penalties.
   - **Investment Choices:** You can invest in anything from stocks to bonds to real estate.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments for a profit.

### **Distribution Strategy:**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.
- **Diversification:** Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### **Sample Distribution:**
- **Short-term savings:** Keep in taxable accounts for easy access.
- **Medium-term (5â€“10 years):** Consider a balanced approach in both IRAs and taxable.
- **Long-term (10+ years):** Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA for compounding growth.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
Finally, consider discussing your situation with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
