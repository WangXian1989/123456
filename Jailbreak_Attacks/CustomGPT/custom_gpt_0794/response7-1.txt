Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy. A Roth IRA is generally preferred for younger investors or those expecting higher future tax rates.
   - **401(k)**: After taking advantage of the employer match, determine how much more to contribute to max out your 401(k) limit if you can. The tax deferral can be beneficial.

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged options, consider investing in taxable accounts. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals and can hold investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds and ETFs).

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Needs**: If you need access to funds in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Balance Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure a proper asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall portfolio strategy. Avoid over-concentration in one account type.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your contributions and the performance of each account type. Adjust your strategy as needed based on changes in income, financial goals, or life circumstances.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If uncertain about allocations or tax implications, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- 401(k): 15% of salary (maximize up to employer match)
- IRA: Up to the annual limit (Roth if eligible)
- Taxable accounts: Any additional savings after maxing out above

### Summary
Balancing contributions across these accounts effectively involves prioritizing tax efficiency while considering your immediate and long-term financial needs.
