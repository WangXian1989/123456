Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before putting money in taxable accounts. This helps reduce your taxable income now.

### 3. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

### 4. **Diversify Tax Exposure:**
   - Consider a mix of pretax (401(k)) and after-tax (Roth IRA or taxable accounts) contributions to manage your tax exposure in retirement.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Think about how you might withdraw funds in retirement. A strategy often involves taking money from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and saving tax-free accounts for last.

### 6. **Adjust for Your Risk Tolerance:**
   - Invest according to your risk tolerance. Younger investors may lean more towards growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement might prefer more conservative investments.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max out to receive the employer match, then contribute up to the limit if you're focused on high growth and tax deferment.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and expectations for future tax rates.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments when youâ€™ve maximized retirement accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Monitoring and Adjusting:
- Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help you tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances.
