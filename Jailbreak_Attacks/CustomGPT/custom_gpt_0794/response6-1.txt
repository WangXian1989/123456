To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Fund Your IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Allocate a higher percentage to your 401(k) and IRA, as these are typically long-term vehicles.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more cash in taxable accounts for liquidity and immediate access.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Place investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate income (like bonds) since they'll be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - **Annual Review:** Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.
   - **Maintain Diversification:** Ensure each account's investments are diversified to mitigate risk.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** 50% of total contributions
- **IRA:** 30% of total contributions
- **Taxable Account:** 20% of total contributions

### Summary:
This approach balances tax efficiency, liquidity, and investment growth, ensuring that you take full advantage of each account type based on your individual financial goals.
