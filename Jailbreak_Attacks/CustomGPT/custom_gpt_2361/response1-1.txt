Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax benefits, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you have flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 3. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - For retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - If saving for short-term goals (like a home), consider using a taxable account.

### 4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might lean more towards stocks in their 401(k) and IRA for growth.
   - Adjust investments based on your age, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Sample Strategy:
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.
2. Max out an IRA (Roth or Traditional based on eligibility).
3. Invest any additional savings into a taxable account for flexibility.

### Conclusion:
Tailor the distribution based on your unique financial situation, goals, and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can also help create a personalized plan.
