To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This gives you a risk-free return on your investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize maxing out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. The contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as youâ€™ll pay taxes on investment returns here. They provide liquidity and flexibility for emergencies or short-term goals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk level and take advantage of tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type later, as 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies that align with your specific financial situation and goals. 

This approach maximizes tax advantages and prepares you for both retirement and short-term financial needs.
