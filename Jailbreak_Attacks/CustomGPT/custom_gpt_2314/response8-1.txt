Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing any 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The tax advantages of these accounts can be beneficial.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If you can afford it, contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These are flexible and can be advantageous for short-term goals or if you want to access funds before retirement without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of your tax bracket. Taxable accounts may be better for investments that receive favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account type.

7. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**: As you approach retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts more heavily and ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
