Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high contribution limit and possible employer matching, prioritize this account.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your eligibility and tax situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Consider Your Taxable Account**: Use taxable accounts for investments with lower capital gains, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability. This account offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within your retirement accounts, consider your overall asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - More aggressive investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - More conservative investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to offset potential capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications, especially with withdrawals. Early withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.
