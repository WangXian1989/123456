Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Both offer tax benefits:
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or ETFs. This minimizes capital gains taxes. Consider keeping high-yielding investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax burdens.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Maintain a balanced portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Debt Considerations**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before focusing heavily on investments.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consulting a financial advisor can help optimize your strategy.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary (to max match)
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Max contributions based on your eligibility
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder of your investment funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

This approach can provide a strong foundation for building your wealth while managing tax implications effectively.
