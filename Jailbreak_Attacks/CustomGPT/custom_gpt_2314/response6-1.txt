Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider the tax implications. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

### 2. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - **Short-term needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need soon. These are more liquid and can easily be accessed without penalties.
   - **Long-term goals**: Prioritize retirement accounts for their tax advantages.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Ensure assets in each account are diversified across stocks, bonds, and other investments. This reduces risk and can enhance returns.

### 4. **Review Tax Implications:**
   - Funds in taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes. Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max out up to the employer match, then allocate more if you have additional funds.
- **IRA**: Fund next, especially a Roth if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for any remaining investments, focusing on lower-turnover strategies to minimize taxes.

### Conclusion:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing income and tax laws, ensuring they align with your retirement goals.
