Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, making this beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, such as dividends or short-term capital gains, which could be taxed at a higher rate.
   - They offer more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to reduce risk. Consider different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

### 6. **Investment Goals:**
   - Align your investments with your time horizon. If you are closer to retirement, consider more conservative investments.

### 7. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and life changes.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% annually (up to the employer match).
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Max out contributions annually ($6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any surplus after retirement accounts and emergency savings.

### Conclusion:
Tailor this strategy based on your unique financial situation and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
