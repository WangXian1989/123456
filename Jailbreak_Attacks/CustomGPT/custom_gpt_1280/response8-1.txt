To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Max out employer contributions to a 401(k) first, then consider the IRA, especially if it offers tax deductions or growth potential.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may generate taxable income, such as bonds or stocks likely to be sold for short-term gains.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon. Use 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth (e.g., stocks) and taxable accounts for short-term goals (e.g., cash or bonds).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify within each account type. Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains in taxable accounts. Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies if applicable.

6. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of contribution limits for each account to optimize tax benefits.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
