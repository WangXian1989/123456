Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund an IRA**
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax-advantaged growth. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise.

### 3. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maxing the match, focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you have a high-income tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, allocate funds to a taxable investment account. This offers more flexibility with withdrawals and can help with shorter-term financial goals.

### 5. **Consider Investment Types and Risk Tolerance**
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance, and consider your time horizon for each investment. Stocks are generally better for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**  
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of investments in taxable accounts, such as capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient investment options like index funds or ETFs.

### 7. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Review your allocation at least annually to adjust based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

Ultimately, it’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
