To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred. Focus on maximizing employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

2. **Investment Timeline**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments.
   - **Medium-Term Needs**: Allocate portions to taxable accounts if you plan to access funds before retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and growth across different asset classes.

4. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before investing in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Develop a strategy for when and how to withdraw funds in retirement, leveraging tax optimization.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, considering factors like your risk tolerance, retirement goals, and current income.

Adjust your approach based on your financial goals, age, and market conditions. Regularly review and rebalance your investments as needed.
