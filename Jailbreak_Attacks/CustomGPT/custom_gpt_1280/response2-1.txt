The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Beneficial if you expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, making them useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can help manage risk and enhance returns.
   - Use the same overall investment strategy across accounts, tailoring the mix of assets based on the tax implications of each account type.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing life circumstances.

### Final Consideration
Consult a financial advisor to customize your approach based on your specific situation, as personal circumstances can significantly influence the best strategy.
