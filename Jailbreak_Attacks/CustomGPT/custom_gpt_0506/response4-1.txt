The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy that can help:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing any 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maximized your retirement accounts.

2. **Consider Taxes**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on interest, dividends, and profits from selling investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance. Generally, stocks are more volatile but offer higher growth potential, while bonds provide stability.
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in IRAs) and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes more efficiently.

4. **Investment Timeline**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on how soon you plan to use the money. Longer timelines typically allow for more aggressive investments.

5. **Rebalance Often**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Work with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor strategies to your individual needs and provide insights into tax-efficient withdrawal strategies during retirement.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
