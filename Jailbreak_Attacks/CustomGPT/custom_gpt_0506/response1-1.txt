Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed if feasible, especially if you benefit from employer matching.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Roth IRA (if you qualify) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not benefit from tax advantages (like short-term trading or real estate). Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. This includes spreading investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

6. **Consider Your Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investment strategy may need to be.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Remember to assess your risk tolerance and investment objectives regularly!
