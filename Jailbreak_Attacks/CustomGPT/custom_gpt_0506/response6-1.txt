Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **Fund IRA Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation) for additional tax-advantaged growth.

### 2. Assess Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These accounts allow you to contribute pre-tax dollars, deferring taxes until withdrawal during retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you anticipate higher taxes in the future.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but they provide liquidity and the ability to withdraw funds without penalties. Consider investing in tax-efficient products, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 3. Diversification and Asset Allocation
- **Diversify Investments**: Distribute the investments among different asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to manage risk and achieve growth.
- **Adjust Allocation Based on Account Type**: For tax-advantaged accounts, lean towards growth-oriented investments (like stocks) since you won't pay taxes on growth until withdrawal. For taxable accounts, consider bonds or tax-managed funds to limit tax liabilities.

### Conclusion
- **Regularly Review**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions evolve.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice based on your specific circumstances ensures the best outcomes.

By following these steps, you can strategically structure your retirement savings for optimum growth and tax efficiency.
