To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes on capital gains.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about your long-term needs. Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals can be invaluable.

Adjust your contributions based on changes in income or expenses, and stay informed about tax laws that may impact your investments.
