   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed, such as:
   - Antivirals for hepatitis

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging can help monitor liver health.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding harmful substances is crucial.
