Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high match, prioritize this.
   - **IRA**: Consider how much you can contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like stocks held long-term.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with your changing goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional**: For personalized advice, consider talking to a financial advisor.

This strategy will help you leverage tax advantages while ensuring liquidity for your personal financial needs.
