To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they provide tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Investments**: Invest in assets that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account according to your risk tolerance and goals.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust holdings periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and take advantage of market fluctuations.

3. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - **Strategize for Retirement**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. 401(k) and IRAs typically have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts do not.

4. **Fees and Expenses**:
   - **Minimize Costs**: Choose low-fee investment options in your accounts to maximize returns over time.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions first (especially if employer matching is available).
- **IRA**: Fund with any additional retirement savings.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more liquid investments or short-term goals.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth while managing tax implications.
