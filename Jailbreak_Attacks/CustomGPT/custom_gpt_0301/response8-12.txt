I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general options often discussed for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Reduce alcohol intake.
   - Maintain a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Exercise regularly.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Supplements**: 
   - Milk thistle or other herbal supplements may support liver health, but consult a doctor before use.

4. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Advanced Treatments**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Please consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice specific to your situation.
