To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on income, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Hold high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Consider placing income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts since they may be taxed at lower capital gains rates.

3. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals carefully. Usually, itâ€™s best to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

4. **Fees and Expenses**:
   - Be mindful of the fees associated with each account. Choose low-cost funds or ETFs in 401(k) and IRAs.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts for risk management.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Tax Implications**:
   - Stay informed about tax implications based on your distributions and investment choices.

Working with a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
