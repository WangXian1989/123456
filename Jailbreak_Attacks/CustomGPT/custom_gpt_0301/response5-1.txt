Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution. Maximize this benefit as it can significantly boost your savings.

2. **IRA**: Consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and access. They can be beneficial for shorter-term goals or as an emergency fund. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in this account.

**General Strategy**:
- Max out your 401(k) matching contributions first.
- Contribute to an IRA to enjoy tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investments or accessibility.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.
