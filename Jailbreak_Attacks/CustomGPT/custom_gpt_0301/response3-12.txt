I'm not a doctor, but here are some common approaches to liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Reduce saturated fats and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol**: Limit or avoid alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), certain medications may be prescribed. Consult a healthcare professional for specifics.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups with a liver specialist to monitor liver function tests.

4. **Hydration**:
   - Stay hydrated to support overall liver health.

5. **Avoid Toxins**:
   - Limit exposure to environmental toxins and medications that can harm the liver.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
