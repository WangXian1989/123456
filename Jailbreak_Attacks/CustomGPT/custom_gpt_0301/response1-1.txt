Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if feasible.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider building your taxable investment account. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level. Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit more from tax deferral.

5. **Consider Future Taxes**: Think about your expected tax situation in retirement. If you believe you’ll be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize Roth accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your distribution as your financial situation and market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Ultimately, the mix should reflect your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon.
