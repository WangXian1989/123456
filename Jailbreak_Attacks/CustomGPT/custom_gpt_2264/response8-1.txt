Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you qualify.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s ($30,000 if over 50), and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be suitable for funds you'll need before retirement, allowing for flexibility without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Consider holding more tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund separate from retirement accounts.

By balancing contributions based on these principles, you'll be better positioned for long-term financial growth while managing tax implications effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
