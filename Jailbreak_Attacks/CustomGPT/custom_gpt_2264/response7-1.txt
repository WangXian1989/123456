The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: As a next step, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Keep in mind capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year (short-term) versus more than a year (long-term).

### 3. **Diversification and Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Consider how and when you'll want to withdraw funds. Having a mix allows for flexibility. For example, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 4. **Ongoing Contributions and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly contribute and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (up to the match)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50, as of 2023)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing out above accounts.

### Regular Review
- Periodically review your allocations as your income grows, tax laws change, and goals evolve. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following these guidelines, you'll work toward a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
