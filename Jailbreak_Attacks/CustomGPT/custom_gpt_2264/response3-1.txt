Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (based on your income and tax situation). The Roth is beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate the Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Generally better for aggressive investing since it has tax-deferred growth and higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA:** Offers tax benefits, but contribution limits are lower. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for flexibility and liquidity, but you’ll pay capital gains tax on profits. They can hold investments you may need access to before retirement.

### 3. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**
   - Use a diversified portfolio across all accounts, focusing on asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - ETFs and index funds are often recommended for their low fees and broad market exposure.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Tax implications on withdrawals can vary. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as income, while Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals. Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus more on growth (higher-risk assets).
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift towards safer investments to preserve capital.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

### Sample Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income (up to the match and maximum limit).
- **IRA:** $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) annually.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder of funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth and minimize taxes. Use taxable accounts for flexibility. Adjust as needed to maintain balance and align with changing financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
