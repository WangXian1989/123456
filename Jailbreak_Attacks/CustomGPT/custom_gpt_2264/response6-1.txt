To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to maximize employer matches first. Contribute enough to benefit from this "free" money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Your Immediate Needs**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals and liquidity. They provide flexibility for expenses or investments without penalties for early withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Consider stocks for growth in retirement accounts, while using bonds or cash in taxable accounts for stability.

### 4. **Review Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Invest in tax-efficient funds or hold investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing financial goals to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to 401(k) to get the maximum employer match.
- Use IRAs for long-term growth.
- Keep a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
- Regularly review your investment strategy for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
