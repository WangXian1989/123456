   - **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications might include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Ceasing alcohol consumption can significantly improve liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and a treatment plan is crucial.
