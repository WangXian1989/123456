The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxes over time, like long-term capital gains or tax-efficient mutual funds. This is also where you can hold non-retirement assets.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Distribute investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you might hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative ones in taxable accounts, considering tax implications on interest and dividends.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Maintain some cash or liquid investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as retirement accounts often have withdrawal penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions first to get the match.**
- **Allocate a portion of savings to an IRA (preferably Roth if eligible).**
- **Invest any remaining savings in a taxable account with a focus on tax-efficient funds.**

### Final Thoughts:
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation, as they can provide personalized insights and help optimize your overall investment plan.
