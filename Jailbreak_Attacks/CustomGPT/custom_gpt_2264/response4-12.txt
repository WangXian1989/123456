I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modification (low-fat, low-sugar)
   - Reducing alcohol consumption
   - Weight management

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis), antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications might be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests or imaging studies to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures may be necessary to remove damaged tissue or a liver transplant might be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
