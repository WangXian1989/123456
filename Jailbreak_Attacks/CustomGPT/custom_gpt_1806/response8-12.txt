It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice about liver issues. However, here are some general approaches commonly recommended for liver problems:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), certain medications may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A healthy diet low in saturated fats, sugar, and salt can help. Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight can improve liver function, especially in cases of fatty liver disease.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and improves overall liver health.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function tests and overall health.

5. **Viral Hepatitis Treatment**: For viral liver infections like hepatitis B and C, antiviral medications may be necessary.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases or end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be the only option.

Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action based on your specific condition.
