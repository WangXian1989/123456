Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k) Accounts**: Often have higher contribution limits and potential employer match. Contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA Accounts**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Each has different contribution limits and eligibility rules.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxed on capital gains and dividend income, providing more flexibility for investments and withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After the match, consider maxing out your IRA. If eligible, Roth IRAs can be particularly advantageous for tax-free growth.
   - **Continue with 401(k)**: After maxing out the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) if you can afford it.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate regular income (like bonds) to defer taxes.
   - Keep more volatile or high-growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, as these can take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Taxable accounts offer flexibility, while withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts can impact your tax bracket.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If your situation is complex, getting personalized advice from a financial advisor can help you create a tailored strategy based on your circumstances.

**Example Distribution Approach**:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough for the full employer match (e.g., 3-5% of your salary) then additional if funds allow.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over age 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can go here, focusing on long-term growth investments.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize for growth and minimize taxes over time.
