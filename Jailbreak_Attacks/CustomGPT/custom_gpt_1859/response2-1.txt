Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. For a 401(k), take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: As of 2023, the maximum contribution to a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re over 50), and to IRAs, it’s $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50). Allocate your funds accordingly to maximize these limits.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, it may be beneficial to contribute more to a traditional 401(k) and IRA for immediate tax deductions. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, consider Roth options (if available) for tax-free withdrawals later.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for greater liquidity and investment flexibility.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a balanced investment strategy that reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Regular Review**: Monitor and adjust your allocations annually or when there are significant life changes. Consider the performance of your investments and any changes in tax laws or personal circumstances.

This overall approach can help you maximize potential growth while managing tax implications. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
