Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is effectively free money and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs give tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Higher Tax Bracket**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts like traditional 401(k)s or IRAs to reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Lower Tax Bracket**: You might benefit from contributing to a Roth IRA, as you'll pay taxes on the contributions but not on withdrawals.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Set aside funds here for short-term needs or emergencies, as these accounts allow for easy access without penalty.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify across all accounts, balancing stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation.
