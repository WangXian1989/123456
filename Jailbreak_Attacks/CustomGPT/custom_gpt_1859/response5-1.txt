Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA:** Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. If your income allows, a Roth IRA is often beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Return to 401(k):** After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k). Consider increasing your contributions to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility. These accounts provide easier access to your money without penalties, which can be important for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Evaluate the tax implications of each account type. Contributions to traditional accounts reduce your taxable income now, while Roth accounts grow tax-free.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changing goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
