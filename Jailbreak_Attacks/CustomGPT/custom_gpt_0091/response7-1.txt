When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions if possible, particularly if it’s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds) and avoid high-turnover assets.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on the specific tax treatment and risk levels.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time frames can take advantage of tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts. Short-term needs may be better suited for taxable accounts.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%

### Additional Considerations:
- Keep the withdrawal strategy in mind as you approach retirement; certain accounts might be better to tap first based on tax efficiency.

It’s wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
