The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRAs) should hold investments that generate high ordinary income (like bonds) to minimize taxes.
   - **Taxable accounts** can hold investments like index funds or ETFs that are more tax-efficient and may benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, tax-advantaged accounts should be drawn upon last to allow for continued growth.

6. **Ongoing Assessment**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation or goals change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
