To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income now but taxes apply upon withdrawal. Good for high-income earners.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains each year. However, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (stocks) and consider bonds or more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a long time until retirement, prioritize higher-risk investments in 401(k) and IRA for growth. If nearing retirement, shift to safer assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep an eye on performance across all accounts. Regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Plan Withdrawals Strategically**:
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals: typically draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) last.

By following these strategies, you'll ensure a balanced approach that embraces tax efficiency and growth potential. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
