Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough for the match, then consider maxing out an IRA.
   - **IRA Types**: Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. They can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Recognize that different accounts have different tax impacts. For instance, holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts can minimize tax burdens.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly reassess your allocation based on market performance and personal circumstances.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs.
