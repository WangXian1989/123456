Sure! To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferrals. If you can, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds or high-yield funds) or short-term gains. Consider holding low-turnover index funds or ETFs here to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts can hold a mix of assets since capital gains wonâ€™t be taxed annually.

3. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If retirement is far away, focus on growth assets (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts. As retirement approaches, shift to more conservative investments to protect capital.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for which accounts to withdraw from first in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
