To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to both Traditional and Roth IRAs, depending on your current and expected future tax situation.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider future tax implications when planning withdrawals. Taxable accounts can often be accessed without penalties before retirement age, while 401(k) and IRAs come with restrictions.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired investment strategy, accounting for market fluctuations and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking advice based on your specific financial situation for tailored recommendations.

By strategically contributing and placing investments in the right accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and grow your wealth effectively.
