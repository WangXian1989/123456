To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, max contributions are $23,000 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up for those over 50).
   - **IRA**: Max contributions are $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: If using a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed as capital gains, so they can be more favorable for long-term growth.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term and long-term goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term savings (retirement) and taxable accounts for shorter-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for more aggressive investments (higher potential returns).
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to utilize lower capital gains rates.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, accessible account before maximizing contributions.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your allocations to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Suggested Prioritization:
1. **Max Out 401(k)** (especially if there's an employer match).
2. **Contribute to IRA** (prioritize Roth if eligible).
3. **Fill any gaps in the 401(k) contribution limit**.
4. **Invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts**.

Tailoring the strategy to your specific financial situation and goals is crucial. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
