Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Prioritize 401(k)**: After ensuring you get the full employer match, max out contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This can be useful for short-term goals or if you want to access retirement funds before age 59½ without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your asset allocation based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. For example, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to get personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Always consider your tax implications when withdrawing funds, and plan accordingly!
