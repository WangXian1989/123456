To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match if available; then consider maxing it out if you're able.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Place higher-taxed investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to delay taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as needed, considering tax implications and your financial goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how and when to withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize tax liabilities.
