Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments subject to capital gains taxes, suitable for short- to medium-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out 401(k) Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you have a Roth option and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds). 
   - Allocate high-growth investments (which may incur high taxes upon sale) in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s.

### 4. **Assess Time Horizon:**
   - Longer time horizons (20+ years): More aggressive investing in retirement accounts.
   - Shorter time horizons: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary to maintain your desired risk and investment strategy.

### 6. **Consult a Professional:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to investing across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
