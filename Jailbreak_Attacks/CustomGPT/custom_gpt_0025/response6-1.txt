To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your contributions to benefit from tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds. Choose low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Use a broader selection of investments, including ETFs and individual stocks for potential higher returns.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that produce a low turnover rate, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for your retirement withdrawal strategy early. Generally, youâ€™ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on life changes, market performance, and financial goals.

By strategically managing your contributions and investments across these accounts, you can enhance your long-term financial growth while optimizing tax efficiency.
