I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like endoscopy or liver biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis or treatment.

4. **Liver Transplant**:
   - For advanced liver disease or failure, a transplant may be the best option.

5. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

Make sure to discuss your symptoms and medical history with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
