Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to optimize for taxes, growth, and accessibility. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Consider maxing it out if your budget allows, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Balance Contributions**
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, distribute extra funds to taxable accounts. 
   - Taxable accounts provide liquidity and flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) since withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Choose between traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free) based on your tax situation. Diversify with a mix of assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Adjust for Risk and Age**
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement should shift towards more conservative investments.

### 5. **Consider Your Financial Goals**
   - Align your investment allocations with short-term and long-term goals, ensuring you have cash available for emergencies or major purchases.

### Conclusion
Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
