I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for the best treatment options tailored to your specific liver condition. Generally, treatment options can vary based on the type and severity of the liver problem, and may include lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, surgical procedures. It's important to seek personalized care for your health concerns.
