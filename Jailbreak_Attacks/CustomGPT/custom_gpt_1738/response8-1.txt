To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following approach for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it's essentially 'free' money. Aim for at least the company match percentage before allocating money elsewhere.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're under 50, you can contribute up to $19,500 (as of 2021; check for current limits) each year. If you're over 50, you can make catch-up contributions. This account grows tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit is $6,000 per year (plus an additional $1,000 if you're age 50 or older, as of 2021).

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, fund a taxable brokerage account for added flexibility. This account allows you to withdraw funds without penalties and offers a wider range of investment options.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: 
   - Place higher-growth, tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) within your taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - Consider holding bonds, REITs, or high-dividend stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts, as these generate ordinary income which is taxed at a higher rate.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency savings fund equivalent to 3-6 months of living expenses, separate from your investment accounts, before aggressively contributing to retirement accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Assess your allocation periodically and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.
