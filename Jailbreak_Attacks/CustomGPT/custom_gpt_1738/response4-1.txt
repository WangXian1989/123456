To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k): Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - IRA: Traditional IRAs also use pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable Accounts: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, so consider the tax efficiency of your investments.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term needs. For retirement savings, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA.
   - If you need liquidity (easy access to funds), contribute more to taxable accounts.

3. **Employer Matches**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere, as it’s essentially “free money.”

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax benefits (e.g., 401(k) limits for employee contributions, IRA limits).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation is diversified across accounts to spread risk and improve potential returns.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:

- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer matches, prioritize contributions up to the match limit.
  
- **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If not, consider a traditional IRA.

- **Taxable Account**: Once you’ve maximized employer match and IRA contributions, allocate additional funds here. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

### Example Breakdown:
- 401(k): 15-20% of your income to maximize employer contribution.
- IRA: 10-15% of your income, split between traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.
- Taxable Account: Remainder of your investment budget, focusing on a diversified portfolio.
