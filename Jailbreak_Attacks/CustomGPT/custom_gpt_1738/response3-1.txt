The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA. Traditional accounts can lower your taxable income, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're in a high tax bracket, traditional 401(k) contributions might be beneficial as they lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth 401(k).
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If not, focus on a Traditional IRA and take advantage of any tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you reach the contribution limits for your retirement accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. Here, you have more flexibility with withdrawals but will need to consider capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Flexibility**: Keep in mind that taxable accounts provide more access to your funds in case of emergency, as compared to retirement accounts which often have penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you continue contributing, periodically reassess your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure where to start or how to balance your investments based on your unique circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized plan.

Ultimately, the balance will vary based on individual priorities and financial goals, so it’s important to tailor your strategy accordingly.
