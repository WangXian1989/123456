Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Favor tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compound growth without yearly taxes.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Keep lower-growth or bond investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications effectively.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation and rebalance annually to maintain your desired risk profile and investment strategy.

By combining these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
