To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Options**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-income years, consider maxing out contributions to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your income.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments (stocks, ETFs).
   - Keep more conservative investments (bonds, cash) in taxable accounts to manage taxes on capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals across all accounts. 

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
