To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full benefit, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match, then consider contributing to an IRA.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may require more liquidity or flexibility.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Time Horizons**: Align investments with your time horizons; longer-term goals can take on more risk, while shorter-term needs should be more conservative.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market conditions or changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
