Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Fund to the employer match level first; it's essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions up to the annual limit if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are taxed upfront, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Fund a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-to-medium-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Tax Considerations**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. Use taxable accounts for liquidity needs.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment mix across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

### Review Regularly:
- Reassess your allocations annually or after significant life changes to stay aligned with your goals. 

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
