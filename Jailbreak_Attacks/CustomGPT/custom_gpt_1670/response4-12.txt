I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems based on general knowledge. It’s always best to consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function and reduce fat.

2. **Medication**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.
   - Anti-viral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Other medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases (like liver cancer or cirrhosis), surgical options such as liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may explore herbal supplements or alternative treatments, but it’s crucial to discuss these with a healthcare provider, as they can potentially interact with medications.

Always prioritize consulting with a healthcare professional for the best approach tailored to your specific situation.
