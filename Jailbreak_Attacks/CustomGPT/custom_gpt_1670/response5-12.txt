I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems vary based on the specific condition, but common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet improvements (low-fat, high-fiber)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications

3. **Monitoring and Support**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests
   - Nutritional support

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Please reach out to a healthcare provider for an assessment suited to your situation.
