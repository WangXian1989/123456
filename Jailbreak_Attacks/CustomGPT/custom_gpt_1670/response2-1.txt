To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Contributions are pre-tax or Roth (after-tax).
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (after meeting conditions).

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs due to their liquidity.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth. Consider the tax implications of capital gains from taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Use different account types to hold various asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment style.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired risk and return profile.

### Suggested Approach:
1. Max out employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to an IRA, focusing on a Roth if you qualify.
3. Use any remaining funds for a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 30%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 40%

Adjust based on your specific situation, risk profile, and investment horizon. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
