To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Max out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth), as they offer tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions now.
   - After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach its contribution limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or stocks that you plan to hold long-term for capital gains.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to minimize taxable gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized assessment of your financial situation can help tailor the best distribution for your specific goals.

Adjust as needed based on changing circumstances or tax laws.
