To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions, potential employer match, good for long-term growth.
   - **IRA:** Tax-advantaged growth, traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access, subject to capital gains tax but useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement (401(k) & IRA):** Maximize contributions in these tax-advantaged accounts first. Aim for at least 15% of your salary if possible.
   - **Short-Term Needs (Taxable Account):** Maintain liquidity for expenses or investments that you may want to access within a few years.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify within each account based on risk tolerance and time horizonâ€”stocks in retirement accounts for growth, bonds in taxable accounts for stability.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate less taxable income, like municipal bonds.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - **Regular Reviews:** Monitor performance and rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

By optimizing each account's strengths and aligning investments with your financial goals, you can enhance overall growth and manage tax implications effectively.
