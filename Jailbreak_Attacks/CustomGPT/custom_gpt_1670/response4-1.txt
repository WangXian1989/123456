To optimize your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals or to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate fewer taxable events. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Equities in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since these grow tax-deferred or tax-free, keep higher growth potential investments (like stocks) here.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Bonds generate regular income that can be taxed at ordinary income rates. Including them in your tax-advantaged accounts can reduce your tax burden.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.
