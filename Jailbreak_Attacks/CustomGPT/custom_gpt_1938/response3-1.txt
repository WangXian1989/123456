Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it offers tax deductions or tax-free growth (as with a Roth IRA).

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Balance Investments**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Assess Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes, so strategize your selling of assets carefully.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.

This balanced approach can help maximize your savings for retirement while minimizing taxes.
