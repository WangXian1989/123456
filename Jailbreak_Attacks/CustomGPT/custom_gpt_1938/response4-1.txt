To maximize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer matches contributions.

2. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like stocks or stock funds since growth will be tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Ideal for diversified investments; consider bonds or other fixed-income assets as withdrawals will be taxed as income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Investment Type**:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - Hold income-generating investments (like bonds) in your taxable account for more favorable tax treatment.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Adjust contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for strategically withdrawing funds from each account type in retirement for optimal tax efficiency.
