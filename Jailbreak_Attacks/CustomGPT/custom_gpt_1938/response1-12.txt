I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms and treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help track liver function and disease progression.

4. **Supplements**: Some people use supplements like milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice!
