Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Once you’ve maximized your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Contribute more to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) if you’re currently in a higher tax bracket, as it lowers your taxable income now. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might benefit from a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Evaluate Liquid Needs**
   - Keep enough cash in taxable accounts for short-term needs and emergencies. Taxable accounts offer liquidity without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments (like stocks) since they benefit most from tax-free growth.
   - Hold more stable or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as you'll want to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure you’re aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A personal advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation, especially concerning tax implications.

### General Rule of Thumb
- Prioritize contributions to your employer's 401(k) for any match, then fund an IRA, and finally, allocate funds to a taxable account based on your overall financial plan.

Consider your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and timelines when making these decisions!
