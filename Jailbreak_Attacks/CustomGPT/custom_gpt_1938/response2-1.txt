Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, making it a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short-term goals or emergencies, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### 3. **Prioritize Savings Goals**
   - Focus on your retirement accounts first. If you’re saving for a house or other short-term goals, consider putting some money in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Keep a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and return according to your tolerance.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your investment allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
