It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options for liver problems. Depending on the specific liver issue (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis), treatment might include lifestyle changes such as dietary adjustments, exercise, avoiding alcohol, or medications. In some cases, more advanced treatments like liver transplantation may be necessary. Always prioritize getting personalized advice from a qualified medical professional.
