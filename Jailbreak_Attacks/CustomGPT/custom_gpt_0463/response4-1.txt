It's generally advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice, but here are some considerations for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if there's an employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing enough to reach the maximum employer match before funding other accounts.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider the tax benefits when withdrawing in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth which can also be beneficial, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These offer the most flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - They can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies as they provide easier access to funds without the penalties associated with early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Think about your current and expected future tax rates. This can help you decide whether to prioritize pre-tax accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) or post-tax accounts (like a Roth IRA).
   - Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

A diversified approach may involve maxing out employer-sponsored plans, contributing to IRAs, and finally using taxable accounts for any excess savings. Balancing your investments according to your time horizon and risk tolerance is also crucial in this distribution strategy.
