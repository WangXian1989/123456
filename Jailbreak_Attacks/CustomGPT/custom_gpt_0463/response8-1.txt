When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be taken into account. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k), but has different contribution limits and eligibility rules. Consider whether you want to go with a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts have fewer restrictions and funds can be accessed without penalty at any time. Investments in taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes when you sell them. 

3. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the accounts, ensure that your investments are diversified. This could mean a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**: If you’re saving for retirement in the long term, you may choose to put more aggressive investments in your retirement accounts where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Taxable accounts might be used for funds you may need in the short to medium term.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for these accounts. As of 2023, the contribution limits are as follows:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older).
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).
   - Taxable accounts: No limit, but consider the overall investment strategy.

6. **Tax Efficiency Strategy**: It may be beneficial to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) inside tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
