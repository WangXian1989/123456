Managing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: The annual contribution limit for 401(k) accounts could influence how much you decide to contribute here.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial, as you pay taxes on contributions now rather than withdrawals later. Conversely, if you believe you'll be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be the way to go.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA, which can provide additional tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest Excess Funds Here**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional savings in a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility since there are no age restrictions or penalties for withdrawals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) and be mindful of capital gains taxes on profitable investments.

**General Tips**:
- Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.
- Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

It's essential to regularly review your strategy to adapt to any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
