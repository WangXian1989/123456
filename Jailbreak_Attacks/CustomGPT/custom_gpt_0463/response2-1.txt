The best strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, investment options, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). This can lead to significant tax savings. Consider your current and expected future tax bracket when deciding between traditional and Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so they might be better suited for investments you plan to hold long-term or for specific savings goals.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Place higher-growth assets (which may generate more capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to shield them from taxes while they grow.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts. Balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Having different types of accounts provides flexibility in managing taxes during retirement.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and retirement goals.
