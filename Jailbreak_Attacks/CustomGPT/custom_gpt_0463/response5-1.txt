(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to consider several factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and overall investment strategy. Generally, here are a few guidelines to follow:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) before putting significant amounts into taxable accounts. These accounts often offer tax benefits like tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in liquid assets outside of these investment accounts, typically three to six months' worth of expenses.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments to manage risk. This often involves a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Remember the tax implications; for instance, withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA and capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed differently.
