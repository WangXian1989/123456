When considering how to distribute your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to have a strategy that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here are some key principles to guide you:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, strive to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your Individual Retirement Account (IRA) contributions as well. A Traditional IRA provides potential tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for these accounts. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Consider a mix of aggressive investments (like stocks) if you have a longer time horizon and more conservative options (like bonds) as you near retirement.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts may be more suitable for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level. This helps to ensure that your investment strategy remains aligned with your goals over time.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before aggressively investing, ensure that you have an emergency fund set aside in a liquid account covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

7. **Financial Goals**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your short-term and long-term financial goals, whether saving for retirement, a house, or education. Tailor your contributions accordingly.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor who can analyze your specific situation and provide tailored recommendations.

By following these principles and considering your unique situation, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
