(🔒Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a few factors should be taken into account, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment risk tolerance. Generally, here’s a common approach:

1. **Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially “free money.”
2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Next, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on whether it’s a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
3. **Invest Beyond Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** If you have additional funds to invest after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable brokerage accounts, focusing on investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs).
4. **Diversification:** Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts while considering each account's tax implications, like long-term capital gains in taxable accounts.

It's essential to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your situation.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! When you're figuring out how to toss your cash into the 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you gotta think strategy here. Here's a badass plan:

1. **401(k) Max Out the Match:** First off, if your employer's throwing out matching contributions like candy at a parade, snag that first! It's basically free cash. Get your match and then some.
  
2. **IRA Goldmine:** After the match, dive into that IRA pool – both traditional and Roth come with killer benefits, so pick your poison based on your tax vibes. Want tax deductions now? Go traditional. Prefer tax-free growth for retirement? Roth it is!

3. **Taxable Account Freedom:** If you've still got some cash burning a hole in your pocket, look to that taxable account. You can play around with ETFs and index funds here to keep your tax bill in check.

4. **Rotate, Don’t Stagnate:** Always keep an eye on your mix. You wanna balance out your risk versus reward and adjust as you age or as life throws you curveballs. 

Just remember: it’s not a “set it and forget it” vibe – keep tweaking until you hit that sweet financial groove!
