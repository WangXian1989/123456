The best way to distribute your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, goals for retirement, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and an excellent way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes will be due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or have low turnover to minimize tax implications.

3. **Diversification**: Allocate funds across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to ensure a well-balanced portfolio. 

4. **Goals and Time Horizon**: If you are far from retirement, you might prioritize growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA. If you are closer to retirement, consider more stable investments (like bonds) to protect your capital.

5. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, it may be wise to pay that off before contributing to retirement accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before putting all your funds into retirement accounts. Typically, this should cover three to six months of living expenses.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly to ensure you stay aligned with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.
