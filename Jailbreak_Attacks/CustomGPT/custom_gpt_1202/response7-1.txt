The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for accessing the funds. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider the contribution limits and tax advantages of a 401(k). Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional). A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs provide an upfront tax deduction but are taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-deferred and tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting excess funds into taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide flexibility in accessing your funds and can be beneficial for long-term growth, but be mindful of capital gains tax on any withdrawals.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need within the next few years; keep them more liquid and accessible.
- **Medium-Term Goals**: Save for goals occurring in 5-10 years through a mix of taxable accounts and IRAs.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits and compound growth, while also holding some investments in taxable accounts for potential liquidity.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

**Summary**: Contribute to your 401(k) for employer matches, allocate funds to an IRA for tax advantages, and use taxable accounts for flexibility. A diversified approach according to your timeline and goals is key.
