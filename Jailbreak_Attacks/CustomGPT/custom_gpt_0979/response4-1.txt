To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, and growth is tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax). Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains and dividend taxes. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage before putting more in an IRA or taxable account.
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible (e.g., $6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. Use your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings to reduce taxable income in the present.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement, or for taxable bonds or funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a balanced and diversified portfolio across all accounts. This may include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. Short-term needs might be better suited to a taxable account, while long-term growth can be focused in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired investment mix.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure about the best strategy, a financial advisor can tailor recommendations based on your specific financial situation, needs, and goals.

By carefully considering your contributions and the purpose of each account, you can optimize your overall investment strategy and tax efficiency.
