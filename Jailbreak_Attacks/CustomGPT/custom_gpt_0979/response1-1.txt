Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k):**  
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Try to contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options:** Choose a diversified mix of funds (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**  
   - **Roth IRA:** If you qualify, consider it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. It’s great for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**  
   - Use this for short- to mid-term investments, where flexibility is key.
   - Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved before heavily investing.
- **Diversification:** Spread your investments across various asset classes to reduce risk.
- **Rebalance:** Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 20-30%
- **IRA:** 30-40%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30-50%
