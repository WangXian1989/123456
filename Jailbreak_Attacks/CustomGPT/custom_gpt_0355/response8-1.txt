To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high taxable income (like bonds) or those you might need access to before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Consider Fees**: Be mindful of fees associated with each account type; aim for low-cost investment options.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Prefer tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and consider tax implications of sales.

This holistic approach helps maximize growth while considering tax implications. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
