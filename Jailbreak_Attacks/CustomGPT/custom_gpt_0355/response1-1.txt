Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments, considering your timeline until retirement.

2. **IRA:**
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Diversify your investments to include a mix of stocks and bonds.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use for short- to medium-term goals (like buying a home or funding education).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- Max out the 401(k) match first.
- Then, contribute to your IRA (especially if it's a Roth).
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts if you have more savings.

### Considerations:
- **Time Horizon:** Longer-term goals can lean towards more aggressive investments.
- **Tax Implications:** Understand how withdrawals from each account are taxed.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.
