Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in assets that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds or tax-efficient ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced portfolio in each account type. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when allocating stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep track of your asset allocation and adjust your investments across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - As you approach retirement, strategize on how to withdraw from each account in a tax-efficient manner.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 20% – focus on employer match and then max contributions.
- **IRA:** 15% – contribute for long-term tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Account:** 10% – invest in low-turnover funds for tax efficiency.
