To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. Then consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Open a traditional or Roth IRA and contribute up to the annual limit. Choose Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments (stocks) to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - Hold more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.
   - Consider income needs in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first if you donâ€™t need to take from tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investments and tax efficiency over time.
