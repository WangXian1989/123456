I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit alcohol, sugar, and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or steroids for autoimmune diseases.

3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins (like vitamin E) or herbal supplements like milk thistle, but consult a healthcare provider first.

4. **Medical Procedures**: Severe cases might require procedures such as paracentesis or even liver transplantation.

5. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are important.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized assessment and treatment plan.
