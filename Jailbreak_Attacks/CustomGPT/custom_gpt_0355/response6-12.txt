I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet (low in fats and sugar).
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function.
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can worsen liver issues.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
