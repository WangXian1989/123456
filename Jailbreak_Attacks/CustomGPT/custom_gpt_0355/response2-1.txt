The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Both provide tax-deferred growth. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they’re realized. Use these for short-term goals or when you anticipate higher future tax rates.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place investments expected to grow the most (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks for taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, focus on preserving capital and stable income in all account types.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts, balancing risk and return according to your timeline and risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals.
