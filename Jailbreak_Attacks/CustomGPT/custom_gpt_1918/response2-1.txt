Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k), especially with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. This effectively gives you free money and is a great starting point for your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose one based on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and a variety of investment options, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, younger investors might focus more on stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer a more conservative mix.

5. **Rebalancing and Strategy**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing financial goals or market conditions. Having a withdrawal strategy for retirement is also essential to manage taxes effectively.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure about the best distribution strategy for your unique situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help maximize your retirement savings while minimizing taxes and ensuring flexibility.
