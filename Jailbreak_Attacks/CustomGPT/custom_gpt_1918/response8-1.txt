The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, such as your investment goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider directing additional funds to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). IRAs offer tax advantages that can enhance long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Allocate investments based on tax efficiency. For example, hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment objectives. A diversified portfolio typically includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Life circumstances change, so periodically reevaluate your investment strategy. Adjust contributions based on income changes, market conditions, or financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy for your retirement savings.
