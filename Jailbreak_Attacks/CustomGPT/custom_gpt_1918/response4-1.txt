Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Firstly, ensure that you are taking full advantage of any employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money. Contribute enough to receive the maximum match.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with additional flexibility in investment choices. If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. This is suitable for goals with a shorter time horizon (like buying a house) or when you need liquidity.

3. **Diversification of Assets**: Consider what types of investments to hold in each account. For example, you might place higher-growth assets in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth while holding more stable or income-generating investments in your taxable account to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Consider your tax bracket and which accounts to tap first based on your retirement income needs.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and goals.
