I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding liver problems. They can provide the best treatment options based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol, as well as medications or medical procedures depending on the severity of the liver issue. Please see a doctor for an accurate assessment and treatment plan.
