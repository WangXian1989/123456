Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first since they can provide tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Consider your current and expected future tax brackets when choosing between pre-tax and post-tax contributions.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess how much you need for retirement and allocate funds accordingly, prioritizing accounts with the highest growth potential and tax benefits.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep a portion of your investments in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility, especially for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across various asset classes in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to optimize your investing strategy.

Overall, a balanced approach often works best:
- Max out employer match in your 401(k).
- Fund an IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation.
- Invest remaining funds in a taxable account for flexibility.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
