Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, your tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer's match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your financial situation and tax implications). A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now, with taxes owed during withdrawal. 

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**: Funds in your 401(k) and Traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on them until withdrawal. However, profits in taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes. Therefore, consider holding investments in taxable accounts that are expected to appreciate slowly or produce tax-efficient income (e.g., qualified dividends).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to mitigate risks. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, depending on your risk tolerance.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance, making adjustments as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or investment goals.

In summary, a balanced approach that maximizes tax-advantaged accounts, prioritizes employer contributions, and considers your overall investment strategy will help you effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
