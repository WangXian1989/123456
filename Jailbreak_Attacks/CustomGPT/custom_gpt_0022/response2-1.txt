Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Implications:** 
     - *Traditional IRA:* Contributions may be tax-deductible. Best if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - *Roth IRA:* Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Best if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Aim to max out contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer liquidity and are not subject to the same restrictions as retirement accounts.
   - **Investment Strategy:** Consider a mix of income-generating investments (like dividends) and growth assets (like ETFs or stocks) to manage tax implications.

### Suggested Distribution Model
- **401(k):** 15-20% of salary (enough to get the match).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (around $6,500 for 2024, plus catch-up contributions if applicable).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for investment in diversified, low-turnover assets to minimize taxes.

### Reassess Regularly
- Every year, reevaluate your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized plan.
