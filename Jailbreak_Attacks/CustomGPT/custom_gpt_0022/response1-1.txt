Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Once you max out the match, prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions, as they offer tax advantages.

3. **Diversify Investments**: In all accounts, consider a mix of assets based on your risk tolerance. Stocks for growth, bonds for stability.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter gains from taxes. Use taxable accounts for income-producing investments that might be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about when you'll need the money. If you're aiming for retirement or a goal far off, you may take more risks.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
