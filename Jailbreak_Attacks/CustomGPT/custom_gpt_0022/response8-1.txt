To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher risk investments (like stocks) might be better suited for accounts where you expect to compound returns tax-deferred.
   - Consider holding bonds or conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on income.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income, deferring taxes until withdrawal during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates. Use tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax impact. For instance, withdrawals from taxable accounts might be taxed at a lower rate if you're in a lower income bracket.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly reassess your investment strategy as your financial situation and goals change.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
