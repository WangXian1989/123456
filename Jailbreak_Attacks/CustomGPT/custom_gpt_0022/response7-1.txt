Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### General Guidelines

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Contribute up to the employer match:** Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Higher contribution limits:** Max out if you can, especially if you're over 50 to take advantage of catch-up contributions.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Tax benefits:** Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.
   - **Diversification of tax treatment:** Consider investing in a mix of both IRAs to balance future tax liabilities.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Funds here are more accessible and can be used for any purpose without penalties.
   - **Capital gains management:** Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impact on withdrawals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start with the 401(k) to at least get the match.
   - Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - Finally, allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts.

2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Choose a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 20% of total investments (max out employer match)
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 10% (max out contributions)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 70% (for liquidity and investment flexibility)
