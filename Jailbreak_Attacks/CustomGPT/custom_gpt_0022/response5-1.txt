(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. A general strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matches, then fund your IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Finally, use taxable accounts for investments that may not fit within tax-advantaged accounts, such as certain types of funds or if you anticipate needing access to those funds before retirement. Diversification across these accounts can also help manage risk.
