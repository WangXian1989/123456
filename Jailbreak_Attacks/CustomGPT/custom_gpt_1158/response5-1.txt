Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money. Prioritize this account for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) to take advantage of tax benefits, depending on your eligibility and income level.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher short-term gains or for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This is beneficial for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Consider Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals, ensuring you maintain a balance in risk and return across all accounts.
