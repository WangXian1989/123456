Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and long-term goals. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

### 2. Diversify Investment Options
- **401(k)**: Often has a limited range of investment options. Choose a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and funds that align with your risk tolerance.
- **IRA**: Offers more flexibility. Consider broad market index funds or ETFs for diversification.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gains strategies.

### 3. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
- Plan withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial, as you can let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Monitor and adjust your portfolio allocation annually based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions and focusing on tax efficiency will help grow your wealth effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
