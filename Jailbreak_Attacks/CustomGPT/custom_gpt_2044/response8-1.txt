The optimal distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributing enough to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limit**: After securing the match, consider how much you can afford to contribute towards your limit (which can vary each year).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now and expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Opt for a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and eligibility requirements, especially for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement or for investments that may not qualify for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, which can mitigate risks.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing funds from your accounts, especially in retirement.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances. It's essential to remain adaptable, as life events and market conditions can alter your distribution plans.
