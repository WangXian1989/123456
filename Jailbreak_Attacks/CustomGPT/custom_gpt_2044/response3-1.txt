The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Begin by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits either at the time of contribution (traditional accounts) or during withdrawals (Roth accounts).

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (traditional or Roth), contributions may provide immediate tax benefits or tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider the tax efficiency of your investments.

4. **Investment Choices**: Use different accounts to hold various types of investments:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth without immediate tax implications.
   - Keep more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure you periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level. This may involve transferring funds between accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, start planning how you will withdraw funds from these accounts to minimize taxes. This might involve strategically withdrawing from different accounts based on tax implications and your income needs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Finally, consider seeking advice from a certified financial planner who can tailor a distribution strategy to your specific circumstances and goals. 

By following these strategies, you can effectively allocate your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while considering both growth potential and tax implications.
