To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if you can afford to.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket:**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or traditional IRA may be beneficial.
   - Conversely, if you expect your tax rate to decrease, prioritizing Roth IRA contributions could be advantageous.

3. **Balance Liquidity and Growth:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that are more likely to incur capital gains taxes, such as stocks that may appreciate significantly. Additionally, having liquid assets can provide flexibility for unexpected expenses.
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review the performance of your accounts and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

By strategically contributing to and distributing investments among these accounts, you can optimize your growth potential, manage tax implications, and ensure liquidity when needed.
