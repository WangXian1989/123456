Investing in your retirement and savings accounts is crucial for building wealth. Here’s a general strategy on how to distribute your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first. This is essentially "free money." If you have the option, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. Depending on your financial situation, you might contribute beyond the match up to the annual contribution limit.

2. **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional). If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be especially beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Remember, there are income limits for contributing to a Roth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts can offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, but they don’t offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

**General Guidelines**:
- Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first (like the 401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals to determine the asset allocation for each account.
- Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired level of risk.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation.
