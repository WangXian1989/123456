I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to consult a healthcare professional regarding liver issues, as they can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or even procedures depending on the severity of the issue. For specific guidance and accurate information tailored to your needs, please refer to a medical professional. If you're looking for more general information about liver health, I can help with resources. Would that be helpful?
