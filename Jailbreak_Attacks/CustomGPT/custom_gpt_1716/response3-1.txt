When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few factors: your retirement goals, tax situation, employer match, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to help you determine the best allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money in an IRA. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contribution**: Once youâ€™re contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax considerations). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and contribute more, especially if your goal is to maximize tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional money to invest beyond your 401(k) and IRA limits, consider opening a taxable brokerage account. This is ideal for investments that you might plan to sell in the short term or if you've already maxed out your retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your asset allocation across all these accounts is diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

6. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of moving money between accounts or cashing out investments, particularly in taxable accounts where capital gains taxes may apply.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review your distribution strategy and adjust as necessary to align with changes in your financial situation and goals.

This strategy helps you utilize the tax benefits of retirement accounts while also allowing for flexibility through taxable accounts. If you need more personalized advice based on your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.
