Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your age, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement plans. Here's a general approach to help you strategize:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, choose based on your current and expected future tax situations.
   - **Diverse Investments**: Use IRA accounts for investments that may benefit from tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Withdrawals**: These accounts allow for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: You can offset gains with losses to reduce tax liabilities.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Start with contributions to your 401(k) to meet the employer match.
- Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you can.
- After maximizing these retirement accounts, allocate additional funds to your taxable account for liquidity and investment flexibility.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust asset allocation accordingly in each account.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons may favor more aggressive investments in retirement accounts.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Customizing your strategy based on personal circumstances can lead to better outcomes.
