To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs work similarly to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. Contributions to Roth IRAs are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. If you sell assets at a profit, you'll pay taxes on the gains. Dividends and interest are also taxed annually.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) outside these accounts before making large contributions.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.

4. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off first before making large contributions.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type:
   - For 2023, the maximum 401(k) contribution is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - The IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

6. **Diversification**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed, especially as markets fluctuate and your life circumstances change.

8. **Long-Term Strategy**: Think about your goals—retirement, buying a home, education, etc. Align your investment strategies with these objectives.

Consider speaking to a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.
