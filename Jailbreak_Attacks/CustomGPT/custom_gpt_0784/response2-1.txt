Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This is beneficial if you're in a high tax bracket now but expect to be in a lower one during retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA Benefits**: If you qualify, consider maxing out a Roth IRA. Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. It's excellent for tax diversification.
   - **Traditional IRA**: This can provide immediate tax benefits if you need that deduction. Pay attention to income limits for deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for savings or investments that you might need before retirement age. They offer more flexibility without the penalties for early withdrawal.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Long-term investments (held for over a year) are taxed at a lower rate.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)**: Max out the employer match.
- **Next, fund a Roth IRA**: Aim for the maximum allowable contributions.
- **Then consider the Traditional IRA**: If eligible and not already maxed out on the Roth.
- **Finally, allocate remaining funds to Taxable Accounts**: This gives flexibility for short-term needs while keeping your retirement accounts optimized.

### Assess Your Situation:
Consider these elements:
- **Age**: Younger investors can afford more risk; older investors may want to shift to more conservative investments.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Your comfort level with market fluctuations should guide investment choices.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer timelines allow for more aggressive investing, while shorter ones necessitate a more conservative approach.

### Final Thoughts:
Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your objectives and changing market conditions. It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.
