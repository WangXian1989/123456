Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some considerations for each type of account and a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Contribution Limits:** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider the impact of future taxes when withdrawing.
   - **Investment Options:** Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) and their fees.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Types of IRAs:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you are aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility for tax deductions.
   - **Flexibility:** Roth IRAs offer more tax-free growth potential, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Investment Flexibility:** These accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but they also come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.
   - **Tax Strategy:** Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains and manage tax consequences. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### **General Strategy:**

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs:** After maximizing employer contributions, consider contributing to an IRA to take advantage of additional tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Account for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts to balance your overall investment strategy. This might be particularly advantageous for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investment choices across all accounts are well-diversified to mitigate risk and align with your investment goals.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:** Continuously monitor your investments and adjust your contributions and asset allocation as necessary based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, or tax situations.

### **Final Consideration:**
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and retirement planning.
