Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with lower contribution limits. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer flexibility with no contribution limits but incur capital gains taxes on profits. These can be useful for short-term goals or other investments outside retirement.

### 2. Determine Contribution Strategy:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: After securing the match, consider funding your IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth advantage.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, direct any additional savings to taxable accounts for flexibility or short-term goals.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k) and traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts can provide flexibility in retirement.
   - **Investment Type**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax liability.

### 4. Regularly Reassess:
   - **Adjust as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changing income, retirement goals, and tax laws.

#### Summary:
- **Maximize 401(k) to employer match**: Essential for getting the most from your contributions.
- **Fund your IRA**: Especially beneficial for tax advantages, choose Roth if eligible.
- **Allocate surplus to taxable accounts**: For flexibility and short-term needs.

By strategically distributing your funds across these accounts, you can optimize your savings for retirement and manage your tax obligations effectively.
