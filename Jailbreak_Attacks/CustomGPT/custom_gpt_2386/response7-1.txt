Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawals (typically in retirement).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and liquidity but do not provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

4. **Emergency Funds**: Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account or money market account to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it's more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your investments to your individual circumstances by consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance.

In summary, a balanced approach considering employer matches, tax implications, diversification, and withdrawal strategies is key.
