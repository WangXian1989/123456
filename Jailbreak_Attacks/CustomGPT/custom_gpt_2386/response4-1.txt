When it comes to distributing your money among different types of investment accounts, such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. In contrast, Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement since contributions are made with after-tax dollars. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages, and you'll be liable for capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Each account has different contribution limits. For instance, in 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50), while the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Ensure you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, if possible.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Consider your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you're saving for retirement (long-term), prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts are designed for that purpose. If you have shorter-term goals, such as a home purchase or travel, a taxable account might be more suitable.

4. **Withdrawal Rules**: Understand the withdrawal rules associated with each account. 401(k)s and IRAs have specific rules about when you can withdraw funds and potential penalties for early withdrawal. On the other hand, you can access money in taxable accounts at any time without penalties.

5. **Investment Options**: Look at what investments are available in each account. Sometimes your 401(k) might offer limited investment choices compared to an IRA or taxable account where you have more flexibility.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k) and IRA Contributions**: If you can, max out contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA to take full advantage of tax deductions and deferment.

4. **Back to the Taxable Account**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity. 

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Regularly review your portfolio for rebalancing based on market conditions, tax implications, and changes in your financial goal.

This balanced approach will help you tap into the benefits of each account type efficiently while working toward your financial goals. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
