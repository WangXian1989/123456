Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the benefits and tax implications of each type of account. Hereâ€™s a general guideline on how to approach this:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. IRAs offer tax advantages that can help your retirement savings grow.

3. **Increase Contributions to 401(k)**:
   - If you can afford it, continue to increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), helping reduce your taxable income or offering tax-free withdrawal benefits later.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any additional savings into a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexible access to your money without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation and Investment Choices**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. For instance, you might hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to reduce immediate tax liabilities.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts. Hold investments for more than one year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates. 

7. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and investment strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor your investment strategy to your personal financial situation and retirement goals.

Always consider your own financial situation and goals, and adjust your contribution strategy accordingly.
