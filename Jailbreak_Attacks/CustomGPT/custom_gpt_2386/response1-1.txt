Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before exploring other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can, ideally up to the annual contribution limit. If you're over 50, you can also take advantage of catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maximally funding your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are more flexible but come with different tax implications (capital gains taxes on investment profits).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your desired asset allocation across different accounts based on your investment strategy. Typically, you may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and hold less volatile investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep reviewing and adjusting your contributions and allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of individual financial situations, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.

Make sure you review this strategy periodically, especially as tax laws and personal financial situations change.
