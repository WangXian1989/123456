Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Matches
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Prioritize Retirement Accounts
- **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact. They are also ideal for short-term savings or for specific goals that you plan to achieve before retirement.

### 4. Allocate Investment Based on Time Horizon
- **Long-Term**: For your 401(k) and IRA, focus on growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) since these accounts are meant for the long haul.
- **Short-Term**: Keep a more conservative approach in taxable accounts if you might need that money soon.

### 5. Evaluate Your Overall Asset Allocation
- Ensure that your total investment aligns with your risk tolerance. Adjust your investments within each account type to maintain a consistent strategy across all accounts.

### 6. Be Mindful of Contribution Limits
- Each account type has specific contribution limits (e.g., 401(k) limit for 2023 is $22,500; IRA limit is $6,500), so plan your contributions accordingly.

### 7. Regularly Review and Rebalance
- Periodically revisit your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they meet your goals and adapt to any changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach leveraging tax-advantaged accounts first while maintaining some flexibility in taxable accounts often yields the best results. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
