Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, which is beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), but contribution limits are generally lower.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You can invest in anything, and while you don’t get immediate tax benefits, you’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits when sold.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Allocate investments among these accounts based on risk tolerance. Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) can hold riskier investments with a longer time horizon, whereas taxable accounts may be better suited for conservative investments to minimize annual tax liabilities on dividends and interest.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before fully committing to these investment accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given personal circumstances can vary significantly, consulting with a financial advisor can help create a tailored strategy.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your personal goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation.
