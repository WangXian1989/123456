Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions if you qualify for tax deductions. 

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to manage capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on 401(k) and IRAs, as they offer tax-deferred growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need within the next few years.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Keep a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account type to reduce overall risk.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations based on performance and market conditions.

### General Allocation Suggestion:
- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

### Final Notes:
- Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
- Be aware of contribution limits and potential penalties for early withdrawals.
