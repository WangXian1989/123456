For liver problems, treatment options depend on the specific condition affecting the liver. Here are some common liver conditions and their treatment options:

1. **Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD/NASH)**:
   - **Lifestyle Changes**: Weight loss through diet and exercise.
   - **Medications**: Insulin sensitizers (like pioglitazone), vitamin E, or other anti-inflammatory drugs.

2. **Hepatitis (A, B, C)**:
   - **Hepatitis A**: Generally resolves without treatment; vaccination is preventive.
   - **Hepatitis B**: Antiviral medications (like tenofovir, entecavir) may be necessary.
   - **Hepatitis C**: Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are highly effective.

3. **Cirrhosis**:
   - **Treat Underlying Causes**: Alcohol cessation, antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - **Manage Symptoms**: Diuretics for fluid retention, medications for itching, and blood pressure control.

4. **Liver Cancer**:
   - **Surgery**: Resection or liver transplantation may be indicated.
   - **Ablation**: Techniques like radiofrequency or microwave ablation.
   - **Medications**: Targeted therapies or immunotherapy.

5. **Liver Failure**:
   - **Supportive Care**: Hospitalization for monitoring and management.
   - **Transplantation**: May be necessary for end-stage liver disease.

6. **Avoidance**:
   - Reduce alcohol intake, avoid hepatotoxic drugs, and ensure vaccination against hepatitis.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
