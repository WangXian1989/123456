To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

1. **Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Allocate investments that generate higher ordinary income or high turnover (e.g., bonds or actively managed funds) to these accounts. The tax advantages allow you to defer taxes on earnings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that produce lower taxation (like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains) here, since these are taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Diversification Strategies**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize employer matches and consider target-date funds if unsure about allocation. Diversify across various sectors based on risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a mix of index funds and ETFs for lower fees and broad market exposure. Focus on long-term growth strategies, like equities.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover funds to minimize capital gains distributions and use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

By strategically distributing investments based on the characteristics of each account, you can potentially enhance returns while minimizing tax liabilities over time. Consider regularly reviewing and adjusting your allocations in response to market changes and personal financial goals.
