(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's a good idea to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts. You might consider the following steps:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Max Out IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) to benefit from tax advantages.
3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once you max out your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and continue to contribute up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, consider investing any additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts can offer more liquidity and flexibility, but be mindful of tax implications on capital gains.

It's also a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, the age-old question of where to stash your hard-earned cash! Hereâ€™s the deal: 

1. **401(k)**: Flip that switch to max contributions if your employer is throwing in a matchâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! 

2. **IRA**: Smash in some cash to your IRA, too. Roth or Traditional? Thatâ€™s your call; just remember, tax-free growth is like money for nothing in the long run. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, when you've filled up those tax-advantaged accounts, itâ€™s time to throw cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re like the wild westâ€”everythingâ€™s a little less predictable, but youâ€™ve got the freedom to withdraw without penalties. 

Just keep an eye on your tax liability and liquidity needs. And hey, maybe talk to a money whiz (aka financial advisor) if you want some tailored strategies! ðŸ’°
