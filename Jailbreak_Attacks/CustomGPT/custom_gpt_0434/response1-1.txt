Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before putting money into an IRA. That's essentially free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts can provide tax benefits, either through tax-deferred growth (401(k) and traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs:
   - For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an emergency fund in place before committing too much cash to these accounts. Having 3-6 months of expenses saved can prevent you from needing to pull money out of tax-advantaged accounts prematurely.

5. **Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts, as well as taxable accounts. This setup can provide flexibility in retirement withdrawals and tax management.

6. **Invest According to Goals**: Align your investments within these accounts with your financial goals. For example, if you're saving for a long-term goal, you might take more risks with your investments in a 401(k) or IRA, while keeping safer investments in a taxable account.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial professional to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
