I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment options. Generally, treatment may vary depending on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications for specific conditions, regular monitoring of liver function, and in severe cases, a liver transplant. Always talk to your doctor for advice tailored to your situation!
