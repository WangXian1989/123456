The best strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - If you’re eligible and prefer the tax deductions, you might go for a Traditional IRA.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you still have room in your budget after contributing to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you reach the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This provides flexibility and access to funds without penalties, though be mindful of capital gains tax on profits.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account, balancing risk according to your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Generally, younger investors can afford more risk, while those closer to retirement might want to prioritize stability.

6. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications for each type of account. For example, placing high-growth stocks in a Roth IRA may be beneficial since those gains can grow tax-free.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance, adjusting as necessary.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation.
