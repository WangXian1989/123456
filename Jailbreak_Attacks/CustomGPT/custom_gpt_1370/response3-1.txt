To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantage Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here first. Consider increasing contributions to max out if you can.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet the criteria.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate excess funds to a taxable account. This allows for greater flexibility in terms of withdrawal without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Long-term investments (held over a year) are typically taxed at a lower rate than short-term investments.
   - **401(k) and IRA Withdrawals**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, so consider your current and expected future tax rates.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to balance risk and return.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and strategic distribution of your investments that aligns with your retirement goals and tax situation. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
