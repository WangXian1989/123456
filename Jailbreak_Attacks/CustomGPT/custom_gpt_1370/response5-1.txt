(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out an IRA (Roth or traditional based on your tax situation). Finally, use taxable accounts for additional savings after you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Diversifying investments across these accounts can help balance growth and tax efficiency.
