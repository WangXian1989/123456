Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which helps reduce current taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. It’s beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these for flexibility and to access funds without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing here.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Balance your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your short-term cash needs. Taxable accounts provide easier access to funds if needed.

5. **Revisit Periodically**:
   - Review your allocation annually to adjust for changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
