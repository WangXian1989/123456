Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribution:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRAs**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Determine if a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA is better based on your current and expected future tax brackets. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.
   - **Limitations:** Be aware of contribution limits and income restrictions for Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts or for short-term goals. 
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Order of Withdrawals:** Plan your retirement withdrawals carefully, typically starting with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred (like your 401(k)), and finally tax-free (like a Roth IRA).

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - **Adjust Investments:** Regularly assess your asset allocation based on market conditions and your risk tolerance. Rebalance as needed.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation.

These steps can help you balance growth potential and tax efficiency across your accounts.
