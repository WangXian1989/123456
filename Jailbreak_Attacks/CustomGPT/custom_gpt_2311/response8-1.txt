Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if you have a high income and want to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you can, open a Traditional or Roth IRA. With Traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into a taxable account. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals since funds can be accessed without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) might be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor might also provide personalized strategies based on your circumstances.
