Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if you can get the match. These contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These are flexible but subject to capital gains tax on earnings. 

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield funds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k)/IRA).
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies tailored to your situations, such as income needs and tax implications.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy.
