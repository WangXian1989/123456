Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider focusing on this if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also provide tax advantages, allowing tax-deductible contributions based on your income.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you qualify, consider maxing this out as contributions grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are often taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Young and high-risk tolerance individuals might invest more aggressively in stocks within the 401(k) and IRA, while more conservative investors may prefer bonds and cash in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

### 4. **Retirement Timeline:**
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift more funds into stable investments to preserve capital as retirement approaches.
   - **Young Investors:** Focus on growth-oriented investments for higher potential returns.

### 5. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies due to their liquidity compared to retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawal.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on performance, age, and changes in financial goals or market conditions.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income (enough to maximize the match)
- **IRA:** $6,500 per year (if under 50; $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Account:** Remaining income after maximizing retirement accounts

### Conclusion:
Adjust these suggestions based on personal circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
