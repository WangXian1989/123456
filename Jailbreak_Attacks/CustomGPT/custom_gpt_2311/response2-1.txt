Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA:** A traditional IRA also offers tax-deferred growth. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement (contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are taxed on capital gains and dividends, providing more flexibility but less tax sheltering compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient cash in an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification:** Allocate investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Think long-term about how and when you'll access these funds. Generally, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### Suggested Steps:

1. **Contribute Enough to 401(k) for Match**
2. **Consider Maxing Out IRA Contributions**
3. **Invest Any Additional Funds in Taxable Accounts**

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation, especially considering tax implications and your retirement timeline.
