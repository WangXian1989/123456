Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Evaluate Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Aim to maximize employer contributions if available.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth; traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages, but you can utilize capital gains and dividends strategically.

### 2. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals (Retirement)**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Funds needed in the near term should go into taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Distribute across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Contribution Limits and Rules**
   - Ensure youâ€™re aware of and adhere to contribution limits for each account type to optimize tax benefits.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize 401(k)** up to employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA** until reaching contribution limits.
- **Allocate remaining funds** to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Final Note
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
