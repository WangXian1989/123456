Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some steps to strategize your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, providing immediate tax benefits. Good for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet the criteria.

3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a high tax bracket now, leaning towards 401(k) and traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you anticipate being in a lower bracket in retirement, Roth options could be more attractive.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate based on risk tolerance:
   - Growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Bonds or stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep a portion in taxable accounts for emergencies, since these funds are more easily accessible.

6. **Yearly Review**: Reassess contributions and allocations annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

It can be helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
