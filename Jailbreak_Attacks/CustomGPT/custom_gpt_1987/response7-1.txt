To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Then, consider increasing your contributions towards the maximum limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRAs or Roth IRA. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Prioritize Taxability**:
   - Put higher-growth investments (like stocks) into tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to potentially reduce taxable events.

3. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re many years away from retirement, lean more into equities in your 401(k) and IRA for growth. As you approach retirement, shift to more bonds and stable assets to protect gains.

4. **Review Withdrawals and Contributions**:
   - Understand the withdrawal rules for each account type. For example, 401(k) distributions are taxed as income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can help customize a strategy based on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.

Consistent monitoring and adjustments based on market conditions and personal circumstances are key for long-term success.
