When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out the IRA**: If you can, contribute the maximum to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). This provides tax benefits and flexibility.
   - **Continue with Your 401(k)**: After your IRA, allocate funds to your 401(k) up to its limit.

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like index funds or municipal bonds).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments that minimize capital gains taxes, such as ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to get personalized advice from a financial planner to tailor your strategy appropriately.

Balancing growth potential with your tax situation is crucial for long-term financial health.
