Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." The contribution limits for a 401(k) are higher than for IRAs, allowing you to save more for retirement.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals are tax-free. A traditional IRA may be better if you want to reduce your taxable income now and pay taxes later at potentially a lower rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement without penalties. These accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to minimize risk. This can help you strategically manage your taxes when it comes time to withdraw funds.

5. **Consider Investment Types**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA), while holding more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk levels.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances and goals.
