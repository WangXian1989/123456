I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver issues. Generally, treatment options for liver problems might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.
4. **Surgery**: In extreme cases, such as liver cancer or severe cirrhosis, surgical interventions might be considered, including liver transplantation.

Please see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
