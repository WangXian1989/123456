When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's best to evaluate several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to get you started:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to secure the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match on your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Return to the 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions (up to the annual limit), if you still have funds to invest, return to your 401(k) to maximize your contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you are maximally invested in retirement accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable brokerage accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and greater access to your money without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Balance Asset Allocation**: Within each account, ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and overall investment strategy. Diversification is key to managing risk.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each type of account. For example, investments in taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, so you may want to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in these accounts.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: As your financial situation changes or market conditions shift, revisit your distribution strategy to ensure it still aligns with your goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances. They can help create a tailored investment strategy that optimizes your tax situation and aligns with your retirement goals.
