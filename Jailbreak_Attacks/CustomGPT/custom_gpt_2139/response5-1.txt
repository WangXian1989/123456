Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Retirement Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) for tax advantages, like tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Fill Up the 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you expect your income to increase in the future.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility for short- to medium-term goals. These accounts may be useful if you have other investments or emergencies before retirement.

5. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**: Consider current and expected future tax brackets. Tax-efficient investing strategies and asset placement can help minimize taxes.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess your allocation based on your evolving needs and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
