Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred. Ideal for higher earnings in your prime working years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or when you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider the tax implications on capital gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investment choices match your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally:
   - **Younger Investors**: May lean more towards equities in 401(k) and IRAs to take advantage of growth potential.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Focus on preserving capital, possibly favoring bonds or stable income in these accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation annually or after significant market changes to maintain your desired risk profile.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts for unexpected expenses to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially with complex situations or significant assets.

By assessing your unique situation and goals, you can create a balanced approach to fund distribution.
