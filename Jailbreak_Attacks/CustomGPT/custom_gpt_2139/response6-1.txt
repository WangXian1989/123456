Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments; they grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: For money you'll need sooner (within five years), consider keeping funds in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments** (stocks) for retirement accounts where you won't need to pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Income Investments** (bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Be Mindful of Taxes**
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Utilize the Roth accounts if eligible, for potential tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax implications.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of income, at least enough to avail full match.
- **IRA**: Up to the contribution limit, considering your eligibility for Roth vs. Traditional.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-15% for flexibility and short-term goals.

### Final Tips
- **Review Annually**: Reassess your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can optimize your strategy based on your specific circumstances. 

By following these principles, you can ensure a balanced and effective allocation that aligns with your future needs.
