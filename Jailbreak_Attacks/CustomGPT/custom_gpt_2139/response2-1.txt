Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax bracket, and financial goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your annual contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are usually less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Diverse Investment Strategy**:
   - Balance your investments in each account according to your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments (like stocks) might be better in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan ahead for withdrawals. Minimizing taxes on withdrawals is key, often starting with taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
