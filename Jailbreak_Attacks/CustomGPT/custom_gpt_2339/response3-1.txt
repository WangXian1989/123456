Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Type:** Choose between a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates.
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible. Taxes are paid when you withdraw in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing the IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement or for specific financial goals (like buying a house).
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and growth based on your timeline and risk tolerance.
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

### Conclusion
By strategically distributing your investments, you can minimize taxes while maximizing growth potential over time. This approach helps in building a solid foundation for a financially secure retirement.
