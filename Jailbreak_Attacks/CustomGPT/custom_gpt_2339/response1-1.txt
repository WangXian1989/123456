Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Workplace 401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider maxing out an IRA (either traditional or Roth) for tax advantages. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Taxation:** Allocate investments based on tax efficiency. For example, place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize taxes over time.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance, goals, and changes in financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation is always a good idea.
