Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in lower-yield investments to minimize capital gains taxes, or consider tax-efficient funds. Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or when you anticipate needing the funds within a few years.

### 3. **Diversification and Allocation**
   - **Diversify Investments**: Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternatives across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan withdrawals based on tax implications; typically, itâ€™s best to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure that you have sufficient liquid funds in a savings account for emergencies before heavily investing in long-term accounts.

### Assessment
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy based on your specific circumstances and to stay updated on tax laws and regulations.
