To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts may be beneficial for short-term goals or when you want flexibility without penalties. These accounts are taxed annually on gains, so consider holding investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds).

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is appropriate and consider tax implications. For example, holding high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts can defer taxes on gains.

4. **Account Purpose**:
   - Think about your financial goals. Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement savings, while using taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds, as this will impact taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to let retirement accounts continue to grow.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
