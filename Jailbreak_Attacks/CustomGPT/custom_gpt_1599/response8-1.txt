To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits.

3. **Diversify Account Types**: Split contributions to both a Traditional and Roth IRA if eligible, to benefit from tax diversification.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about your retirement income strategy. Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investments across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation based on risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies based on your personal financial situation and long-term goals.

This approach provides a balanced and tax-efficient distribution of your investments.
