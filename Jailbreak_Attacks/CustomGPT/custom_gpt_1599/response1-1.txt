Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After the match, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) before going back to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for short-term goals or for funds you may need access to before retirement. 

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your portfolio's performance and adjust allocations as needed to align with your investment strategy.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
