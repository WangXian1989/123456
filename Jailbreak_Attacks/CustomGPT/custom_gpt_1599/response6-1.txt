To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Contribute to 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Max out your IRA contributions if you qualify. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Asset Allocation**
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes and place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Risk Tolerance Consideration:** Adjust the mix of stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance and time horizon in each account type.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Optimize asset allocation based on account type to minimize taxes.
