To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if there's an employer match. This account offers tax advantages for retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Depending on your income, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Aim to maximize contributions here as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement or for goals outside of retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to manage capital gains.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts aligning with your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
