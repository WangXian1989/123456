(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you may want to prioritize contributions based on the following:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. The contributions are tax-deferred, making it a good option for retirement savings.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as they also offer tax advantages. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it could be beneficial for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may offer more flexibility or for additional savings after you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of the tax implications of investing in taxable accounts, especially regarding capital gains.

Developing a personalized strategy and consulting with a financial advisor can also ensure that your distribution aligns with your overall financial plan.
