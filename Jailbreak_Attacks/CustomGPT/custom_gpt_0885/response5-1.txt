(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between them depends on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds needed in the short term or after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts.

Balancing contributions among these accounts should align with your overall retirement strategy and financial circumstances. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

1. **401(k):** Start by cramming your face with as much as you can here—especially if your employer is throwing in a match—it's like a bonus topping! Max that baby out if you can!

2. **IRA:** After you've loaded up on your 401(k), jump into the IRA world. If you like having tax-free withdrawals later, go for the Roth. If the current tax savings are more appealing, hit up the Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, sprinkle some dough into your taxable accounts for short-term needs. Just keep an eye on those pesky capital gains—nobody likes a surprise tax bill!

So, distribute your funds like you're curating a fancy cheese board—make sure every flavor is represented according to your financial taste buds, future goals, and what kind of risk you're comfy with. And don’t forget, a financial advisor is like a pizza chef… they can help you whip up a perfect pie tailored just for you! 🍕💰
