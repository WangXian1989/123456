To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are advantageous for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you can still invest more, continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, to minimize tax burden. Also, consider using these accounts for short-term goals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep tax implications in mind, especially with withdrawals in retirement. 

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor strategies to your specific situation.

This approach balances tax advantages and liquidity needs, optimizing your overall investment strategy.
