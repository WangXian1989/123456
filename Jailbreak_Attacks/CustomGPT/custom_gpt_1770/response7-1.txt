To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (up to $6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use traditional accounts for tax-deferred growth and taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like qualified dividends). Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when making decisions.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth, riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency over the long term. Use income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable tax treatment.

4. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Savings**:
   - Maintain accessible cash in taxable accounts for emergencies before aggressively investing.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals, adjusting contributions accordingly.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your strategy for growth and tax efficiency. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
