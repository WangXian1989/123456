To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If eligible, contribute to lower your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider this for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of funds (stocks, bonds); typically better for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Similar approach as the 401(k), focusing on a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that might generate long-term capital gains (like stocks) to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Regular Contributions**
   - Set up automatic contributions to all accounts. Prioritize accounts as per tax efficiency and match benefits.
   - Reassess periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Use taxable accounts first if in a lower income bracket, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for later.

By consistently contributing to these accounts while considering tax implications and your long-term goals, you can optimize your financial growth and retirement savings.
