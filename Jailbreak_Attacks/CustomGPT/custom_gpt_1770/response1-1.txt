Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributions here first, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.
   - Invest in low-turnover funds or tax-efficient investments to minimize taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks are generally better suited for long-term growth, while bonds provide stability.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs), and consider holding higher yielding or less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.
