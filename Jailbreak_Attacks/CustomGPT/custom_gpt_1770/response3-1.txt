Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**
   - If you have any high-interest debt, consider paying that off before maximizing retirement contributions.

### 3. **Contribute to IRA**
   - After the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you can afford it, increase your contributions to your 401(k) after funding your IRA. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

### 6. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Depending on your risk tolerance and investment timeline, allocate your investments across different accounts. Generally, it's best to hold higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to potentially minimize taxes on growth.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and contributions as your financial situation changes or retirement approaches.
