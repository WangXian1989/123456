   - Avoiding alcohol and substances that can harm the liver.
   - Maintaining a healthy weight through exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, various medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular monitoring of liver function and potential complications through blood tests and imaging studies.

4. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In some cases, procedures might be necessary to address complications, such as procedures to reduce pressure in the veins of the liver or surgery for liver tumors.

5. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - For severe liver disease or failure, a liver transplant may be considered.

It's critical to follow the guidance of a healthcare professional who can provide a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
