Investing and distributing money across your retirement accounts and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. This is a good option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k) but with different contribution limits and flexibility. If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA if you believe you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later on.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t offer tax benefits upfront but allow you to withdraw funds without penalties. They can be advantageous for short-term savings and investments.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio in each account type. Consider your risk tolerance when choosing investments—stocks for growth, bonds for stability, etc.—to balance your overall asset allocation.

4. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting as needed based on market performance and changes to your financial goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider the order of withdrawals. Generally, it may make sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs), and lastly from Roth accounts, to minimize your tax burden throughout retirement.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy depends on your unique situation and financial goals.
