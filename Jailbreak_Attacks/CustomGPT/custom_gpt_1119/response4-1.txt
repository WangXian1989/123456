When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key factors: 

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax for traditional 401(k) plans, lowering your taxable income, and funds grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Consider your current tax bracket and expected taxes in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates, depending on how long you've held the investments.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you understand the annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, in 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 if you are age 50 or older), while the limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 for those age 50 and older).

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you need liquidity in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts for easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Employer Match**:
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, it's typically a good strategy to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating additional funds elsewhere, as this is essentially "free money."

5. **Consider Personal Financial Needs**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment preferences. A well-diversified portfolio is crucial, regardless of account type.

6. **Roth vs. Traditional Decisions**:
   - Depending on your situation, you may want to consider whether to prioritize a Roth account (for tax-free growth) or traditional accounts (for immediate tax benefits). 

7. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations among the accounts based on performance and market conditions to maintain your desired risk level.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- **Contribute to Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends for liquidity or short-term needs.
- **Traditional IRA Considerations**: If you're maxed out on employer contributions and the Roth IRA, consider the traditional IRA.

### Example Distribution:
1. 401(k): Contribute enough to get the maximum match. 
2. Roth IRA: Max out contributions if eligible.
3. Taxable Account: Allocate any remaining funds here for flexibility and diversification.

Be sure to adjust this strategy as your personal circumstances and tax laws change over time. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation.
