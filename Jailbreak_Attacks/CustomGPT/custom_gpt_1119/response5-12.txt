Common issues include fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), lifestyle changes such as weight loss, exercise, and a healthy diet are often recommended. Viral hepatitis may require antiviral medications, while cirrhosis management focuses on treating complications and preventing further liver damage. In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
