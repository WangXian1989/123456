Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching contributions. Consider maximizing any employer match as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be either Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (taxed now, tax-free in retirement). Evaluate which type suits your tax situation best.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Establish Financial Goals**: 
   - Define short-term (within 5 years), medium-term (5-10 years), and long-term (10+ years) goals. This influences how much to allocate to each account type.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)** should generally hold investments that generate ordinary income or short-term capital gains (like bonds or active funds) to minimize tax burden.
   - **Taxable accounts** can hold investments such as index funds or stocks with beneficial long-term capital gains tax treatment.

4. **Determine Allocation**:
   - Strive for a balanced approach. For example, you could consider:
     - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA if applicable.
     - **IRA**: If you are eligible, consider contributing the maximum limit annually (for 2024: $6,500 or $7,500 if you are 50 or older).
     - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, invest any additional savings here for liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors often take more risks in their investments. However, as you approach retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically check the performance of your accounts. Rebalance your portfolios to maintain your targeted allocation as market conditions and your circumstances change.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances, investment options, and tax implications.

By following these steps, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and retirement plans.
