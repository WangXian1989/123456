Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Aim to maximize contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for goals that are shorter-term or if you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Focus on a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, that generate less taxable income.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If your situation is complex, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

Always consider your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals when deciding how to allocate your investments.
