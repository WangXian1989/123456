Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum limit, especially if you can benefit from the tax deductions. Consider the investment options available and fees associated with your plan.
   - **IRA**: Make contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After fully funding your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings in taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties and potentially realize capital gains at favorable tax rates.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re saving for specific goals (e.g., buying a house, retirement), align your investment strategy accordingly. Longer-term needs typically benefit from more aggressive investments, while short-term needs should be more conservative.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your financial situation and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.

The right strategy may vary based on your personal financial landscape, so consider your options carefully.
