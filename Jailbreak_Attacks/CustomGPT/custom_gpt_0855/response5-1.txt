Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contribution if possible (limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50.

2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. These accounts offer flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes on investment profits.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. You can hold different asset classes in each account to optimize tax efficiency (e.g., hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable ones).

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement carefully. Generally, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for as long as possible to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Reassess your distribution strategy periodically to reflect changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
