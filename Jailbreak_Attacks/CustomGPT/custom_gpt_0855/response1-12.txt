I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information. Treatment for liver problems depends on the specific condition. Here are some common options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, weight management, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol or drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, like antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function tests and imaging studies to monitor disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical options may be necessary, like for tumors or severe liver damage.

5. **Liver Transplant**: This may be considered for advanced liver failure or cirrhosis.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
