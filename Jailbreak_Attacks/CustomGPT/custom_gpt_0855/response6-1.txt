Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for tax efficiency and maximizing growth. Here are several key considerations:

1. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize maxing out contributions to capture the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA allows tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings or investments, particularly if you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial due to tax deductions on contributions.
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be advantageous, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth; these accounts are designed for retirement, allowing you to invest in a diversified portfolio.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications when you retire. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help manage your tax bracket and delay withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for tax efficiency and growth.
