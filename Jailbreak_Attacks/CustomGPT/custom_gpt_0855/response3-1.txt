Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and how soon you plan to access the funds. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: 
   - If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible)**:
   - If you qualify based on income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, and you can access contributions (not earnings) tax-free before retirement.

3. **Fund a Traditional IRA**:
   - If you have additional funds to invest, contribute to a traditional IRA. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and the money can grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After contributing to your IRA, direct any additional savings into your 401(k) up to the contribution limit. The tax-deferred growth is beneficial, especially if your employer matches.

5. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement or for short-term goals. These accounts are also suitable for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

6. **Review Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in Roth IRAs) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Rethink Withdrawals**: 
   - When you retire, strategically withdraw from these accounts to manage your taxable income and minimize taxes. 

It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
