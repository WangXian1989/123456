To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Retirement Goals**: Identify your retirement savings goals and timeline. How much do you need to save and by when?

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out employer matching contributions first if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. Use these for short to medium-term investments or for money needed before retirement.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2024, limits are subject to change, so check the current guidelines.

4. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available in each account. 401(k) plans may have limited options, while IRAs and taxable accounts typically offer a broader range.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider your need for liquidity. Taxable accounts provide immediate access to funds, while retirement accounts have penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes and account types to mitigate risk.

A general strategy might include:

- Maxing out your 401(k) contributions up to any employer match.
- Funding your IRA, prioritizing Roth if you're eligible and anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
- Finally, allocate any additional savings to your taxable account for flexibility and other investment opportunities.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances and long-term financial goals.
