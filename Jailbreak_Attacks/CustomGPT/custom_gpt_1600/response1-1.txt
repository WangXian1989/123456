Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, you can consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Contributions Limits:**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2024, the limits are:
     - 401(k): $23,000 (under 50) or $30,000 (50 and older).
     - IRA: $6,500 (under 50) or $7,500 (50 and older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds that you may need before retirement age or for investment strategies that benefit from lower capital gains rates, such as long-term investments.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Generally, focus on long-term growth. Consider a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Younger investors may lean towards more equities for growth, while older investors may shift towards bonds for stability.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of tax implications when buying and selling investments. Favor long-term investments and tax-efficient funds.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help you devise a strategy that aligns with your financial goals.

This approach combines maximizing tax advantages and developing an investment strategy that suits your needs while keeping an eye on tax implications.
