Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach you can follow:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Determine how soon you need access to your money. Short-term goals may require keeping funds in taxable accounts, while long-term goals can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are often preferable for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for investments that might generate high taxable income. They can also serve as emergency funds since they don’t have withdrawal penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Consider holding investments that generate capital gains in taxable accounts for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. This applies across all account types.

### 5. **Periodic Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and make adjustments as necessary to keep your asset allocation aligned with your goals.

### Example Strategy
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions**: Up to the company match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Prioritize a Roth IRA if eligible.
3. **Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts**: For investment opportunities and liquidity.

This approach provides a balanced strategy to optimize your investments, maximize tax benefits, and maintain flexibility. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
