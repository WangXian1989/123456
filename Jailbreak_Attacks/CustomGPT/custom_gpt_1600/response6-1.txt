To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains or income, as these can be less tax-efficient in tax-deferred accounts.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth investments since you wonâ€™t need to access these funds for years. Higher-risk options might be more suitable here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more liquid assets or those that generate dividends or interest income, which can be strategically utilized without penalties for early withdrawal.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: For 2024, try to contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRA ($23,000 for 401(k) if under 50; $6,500 for IRA) to take advantage of employer matches and tax benefits.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: Once you max out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan Your Withdrawals**: When preparing for retirement, develop a strategy for which accounts to withdraw from first, considering tax implications to minimize taxable income during retirement.

### Conclusion
By balancing tax efficiency with your investment goals and maximizing contributions, you can create a robust portfolio that supports both your short-term needs and long-term retirement planning. Regularly reassessing your strategy in light of changing life circumstances and tax laws is also vital to stay on track.
