Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher later on.

2. **Focus on Taxable Accounts Last:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility but don't offer the same tax benefits.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Generally suitable for long-term investments. Choose a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-managed funds if you’re investing significant amounts.

4. **Be Mindful of Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes. Typically, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

5. **Review and Adjust Annually:**
   - Reassess your investment allocations each year based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Ultimately, tailoring this strategy to your unique circumstances and consulting with a financial advisor can help you make the best decisions.
