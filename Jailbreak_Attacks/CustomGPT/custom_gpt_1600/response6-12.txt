I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about treatment options for liver problems. The best treatment will depend on the specific liver condition you're facing (like hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, etc.) and its severity. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol, unhealthy fats, and excessive sugars.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the strain on your liver.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Medications**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral drugs can help manage the infection.
   - **Antioxidants and Supplements**: Some supplements, like Vitamin E, have been studied for fatty liver disease.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Biopsy**: This can provide a clear picture of liver health and determine the best course of action.
   - **Transplantation**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary if the liver is significantly damaged.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and adjust treatments as necessary.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to get a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment options.
