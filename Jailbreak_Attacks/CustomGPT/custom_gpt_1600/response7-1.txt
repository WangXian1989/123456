Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**  
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**  
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If you still have funds to invest after maxing out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**  
   - If you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider directing additional savings into a taxable account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals but comes with capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 4. **Investment Selection**  
   - **401(k):** Focus on funds with lower fees and a diverse set of options. Often, target-date funds are good for retirement planning.
   - **IRA & Taxable:** Diversify with a mix of stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds, depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**  
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on market conditions and changes in your financial status.

### Considerations:
- **Liquidity Needs:** Think about when you'll need access to the funds. Taxable accounts allow for easier access compared to retirement accounts with penalties.
- **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of withdrawal rules and tax implications for each account type.

Adjust this strategy based on your personal situation and consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
