Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs can reduce taxable income now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you can invest any additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure you're diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and specific investments. Consider a mix of growth and income-generating assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Plan for Liquidity Needs**:
   - Maintain enough cash or liquid assets in taxable accounts for short-term needs. This can help avoid penalties from early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and rebalance your portfolio as needed. Changes in market conditions or personal circumstances may require adjustments.

6. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - If unsure, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

This strategy will help you balance growth potential and tax efficiency while ensuring liquidity when needed.
