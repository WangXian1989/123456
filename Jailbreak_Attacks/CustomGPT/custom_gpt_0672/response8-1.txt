To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - For 401(k): In 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older).
   - For IRAs: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs reduce taxable income now; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow without tax benefits but dividends and capital gains are taxable as realized.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments across different accounts based on your risk tolerance:
   - Higher-risk investments can be placed in taxable accounts to defer taxes.
   - More stable investments could go in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: In retirement, strategically withdraw from these accounts:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Be mindful of tax brackets when withdrawing from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Reassess your asset allocation and contributions periodically based on market conditions, tax considerations, and personal financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your specific situation.

Balancing your contributions this way can help you maximize growth while managing taxes effectively.
