I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:  
   - Healthy diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoid alcohol: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can significantly help liver health.
   - Weight management: Maintaining a healthy weight can decrease liver disease risks.

2. **Medications**:  
   - Antivirals: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can reduce inflammation and viral load.
   - Corticosteroids: Used in autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.
   - Other specific medications depending on the underlying cause (e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid for cholestatic liver diseases).

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**:  
   - Regular blood tests: To monitor liver function and detect any worsening conditions.
   - Imaging studies: Such as ultrasounds or MRIs to assess liver structure.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**:  
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver biopsy, or even liver transplantation, may be necessary.

5. **Supportive Care**:  
   - Nutritional support: Working with a dietitian to ensure proper nutrition.
   - Managing symptoms: Treating associated symptoms like itching, fatigue, or pain.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan based on your specific condition.
