Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After capturing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax preferences).
   - Traditional IRAs can reduce taxable income in the year of contribution, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, focus more on Roth accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)).
   - If you anticipate a lower tax rate, contributions to Traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds needed before retirement or for short-term goals, as they don’t have the same tax advantages.
   - Consider using these accounts for investments that produce lower taxable income, like municipal bonds or index funds.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that you have a diverse asset allocation across all accounts. Stocks can be held in tax-advantaged accounts for growth, while bonds may be better suited for taxable accounts due to their income nature.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your investments across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k) and IRA), and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRA) to optimize taxes.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual circumstances can greatly differ; working with an advisor can help tailor strategies to your specific needs and goals.

Evaluating these aspects will help you make informed decisions about where to allocate your money effectively.
