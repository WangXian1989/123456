To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Current vs. Future Tax Rates:** If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. If lower, traditional accounts might be better.
   - **Withdrawals:** Plan for how and when you will withdraw from these accounts, especially since tax implications vary.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure each account holds a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your target risk profile.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Order of Withdrawals:** In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Needs:** Use these for expenses in the near term to avoid penalties and taxes on early withdrawals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distributions for both growth and tax efficiency. Always consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
