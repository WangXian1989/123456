Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, such as index funds.
   - **Hold Bonds or High-Yield Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Bonds often generate interest that is taxed as ordinary income, so they are better suited for tax-deferred accounts.

### 3. Investment Strategy
   - **Growth Assets (Stocks):** Allocate more towards stocks in tax-advantaged accounts where growth won't be taxed until withdrawal.
   - **Income-Producing Assets:** Place these in taxable accounts if they're lower-yield investments, while keeping higher-yield investments in tax-deferred accounts.

### 4. Regular Rebalancing
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, contributions, and changing financial goals.

### Personalized Approach
Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
