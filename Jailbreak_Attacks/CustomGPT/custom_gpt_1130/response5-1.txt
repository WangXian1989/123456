Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Contribute Enough to Get the Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: The IRS sets annual contribution limits, so maximize your contributions if possible.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Prioritize Roth IRAs for Tax-Free Growth**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRAs for Tax Deductions**: If your income is high and you need tax deductions, a traditional IRA might be beneficial.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: These accounts can be useful for investments you might need to access before retirement. Keep in mind the capital gains tax.
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Consider using index funds or ETFs that are more tax-efficient.

### General Tips:
- **Diversify Your Investments**: Regardless of the account type, diversification helps manage risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: As market conditions change, rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Both account types have different fee structures, impacting your overall returns.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation is also a wise choice.
