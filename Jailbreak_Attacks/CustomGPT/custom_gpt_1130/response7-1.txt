To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.
3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Generally, it's wise to prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and Traditional IRA) for the tax benefits they provide now.

### Taxable Accounts
1. **Invest in Growth-Heavy Assets**: In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that have a lower turnover rate or are likely to generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
2. **Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting**: This strategy involves selling losing investments to offset gains, helping to reduce your overall tax liability.

### General Recommendations
1. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover at least 3-6 months of expenses.
2. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk and reward based on your investment timeline and financial goals.
3. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changing circumstances, market conditions, and tax laws.
