Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the limit is $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Consider a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. A Roth IRA may be better if you expect your tax rate to increase since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit is $6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2024.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use this for money you might need before retirement, as it provides more access without penalties.
   - **Investment Options**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Step 1**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- **Step 2**: Max out your IRA contributions (consider Roth vs. Traditional based on your tax situation).
- **Step 3**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit.
- **Step 4**: Invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency.

### Other Considerations:
- **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across accounts.
- **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes, often withdrawing from taxable accounts first.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.
