Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits:** If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, using a pre-tax 401(k) can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional:** 
     - **Roth IRA**: Great for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Useful for tax-deferred growth if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits:** Keep in mind the contribution limits for IRAs ($6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Ideal for funds you may need before retirement, as they don't have withdrawal penalties.
   - **Investment Strategy:** Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Summary of Strategies
- **Prioritize contributions** to your 401(k) up to the match, then route funds to an IRA, and lastly to taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance regularly** based on age, risk tolerance, and changes in income to optimize growth and tax efficiency.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your circumstances.
