Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but you can access funds without penalties. Consider these for investments that you plan to hold long-term to benefit from capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

4. **Adjust for Time Horizon**: If retirement is decades away, you might favor stocks for higher growth potential. As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments.

5. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**: Regularly review your portfolio to adjust for any changes in your risk tolerance or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a professional can help tailor your distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation.

Ultimately, a balance between these accounts, maximizing tax advantages, and aligning with your financial goals will provide a sustainable investment strategy.
