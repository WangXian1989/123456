   - Regular blood tests to check liver function and monitor disease progression.
   - Imaging tests may be required to assess liver condition.

4. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy, or endoscopy may be necessary.
   - In advanced liver disease, liver transplantation might be considered.
