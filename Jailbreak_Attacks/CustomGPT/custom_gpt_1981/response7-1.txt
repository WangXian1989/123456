Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your investment goals, time horizon, tax situation, and current financial circumstances. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Start with your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Next, consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and goals. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them attractive if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use tax-efficient funds for your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Index funds and ETFs tend to be more tax-efficient than actively managed funds.
   - Consider placing higher-yield investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield that income from taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure you diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. 
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments while keeping more liquid and conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts, especially after market fluctuations.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If retirement is far away, you may want to be aggressive in your 401(k) and IRA. As you approach retirement, shift some assets into safer investments to preserve capital.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals smartly to minimize tax impacts, often favoring taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this approach to your specific situation.
