Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to receive the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. Consider increasing your contributions if you’re not at the maximum limit (2023 limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over age 50).
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA (2023 contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if over age 50). A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** 
   - Money in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grows tax-deferred but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility and easier access to funds, but you will pay capital gains tax on any profits.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** 
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives. 
   - You can use tax-efficient funds in your taxable account, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax implications.

5. **Stay Flexible:** As your financial situation changes, revisit your strategy periodically and adjust contributions to reflect any changes in income, goals, or financial circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you’re unsure about the best approach for your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial landscape.

By following these guidelines and considering your personal situation, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
