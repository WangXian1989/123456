Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

2. **IRA Accounts**: After you've secured the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts to invest any additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts. This is also a good option if you want more flexibility with withdrawals before retirement age without penalties. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, growth-oriented investments (like stocks) could be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments or those generating regular income could be held in taxable accounts.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, a financial advisor can help you create a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.

Remember, everyone’s situation is different, so it’s critical to assess your financial goals and needs when distributing your funds.
