To optimize your distribution of money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, benefiting from tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax implications, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.
   - **Hold Bonds or REITs in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: These generate ordinary income, which is typically taxed at a higher rate.

3. **Monitor Your Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA) and bond funds or interest-generating investments in taxable accounts to reduce your overall tax burden.

4. **Balance for Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess your retirement timeline, ensuring that you have a balanced approach to both growth and stability based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in tax laws and personal financial circumstances to ensure optimal growth and tax efficiency over time.
