The distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a general guide to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider the fees and investment options in your 401(k). If they're high, you might want to limit contributions after capturing the match.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: 
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions now, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these accounts for savings goals that are shorter-term than retirement.
   - These can be beneficial for managing capital gains, as long-term investments are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to capture the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, max out your IRA contributions next (especially if it’s a Roth).
3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have any, prioritize paying this off. 
4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use any additional funds to invest in taxable accounts.

### Considerations:

- **Tax Bracket**: Assess your current and expected future tax brackets.
- **Withdrawal Timeline**: Retirement accounts generally have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts offer more flexibility.
- **Investment Horizon**: The longer you have until you need the funds, the more aggressive you can afford to be with investments.

It's best to tailor this strategy to your specific financial circumstances, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
