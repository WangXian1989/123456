To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a **401(k)** may reduce your taxable income, giving you an immediate tax benefit.
   - **IRAs** (Traditional or Roth) also have different tax implications, where Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions upfront, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts** do not have tax advantages but allow for flexible access to funds without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you're investing for long-term growth and retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.
   - For shorter-term goals or immediate access, utilize taxable accounts since they allow for more liquidity.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits:
     - **401(k)**: Typically up to $19,500 (with a $6,500 catch-up for those over 50).
     - **IRA**: Generally $6,000 (with a $1,000 catch-up).
   - Distributing contributions across these accounts will maximize your tax advantages.

4. **Employer Match**:
   - Take full advantage of any employer matching contributions to your 401(k); this is effectively "free money" that can significantly enhance your total retirement savings.

**Recommended Strategy**:
- **Max out employer match** in your **401(k)** first.
- **Contribute to your IRA** next, focusing on a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement or a Traditional IRA if you anticipate being in a lower bracket.
- Once both are maxed out or contribution limits are met, allocate additional funds to a **taxable account** for greater flexibility.

Ultimately, your specific circumstances, including current income, retirement timeline, and investment objectives, should guide your asset distribution strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual financial situation is also recommended.
