The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax advantages, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide which type aligns with your tax strategy.
   
3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a taxable account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Options**: 401(k) plans may have limited investment options compared to IRAs or taxable accounts. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, consider prioritizing contributions to an IRA.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you want flexibility in accessing funds. Taxable accounts also allow for the use of tax-loss harvesting strategies.

6. **Overall Asset Allocation**: Assess your overall portfolio allocation and risk tolerance. Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) and place more aggressively taxed investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

7. **Retirement Timeline**: If you’re closer to retirement, you may want to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts that offer more stability and less volatility.

Ultimately, it’s wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor the best strategy to your personal situation.
