To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contributions Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket. However, you will pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Consider this option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement (including earnings) are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize funding a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these do not offer tax benefits, they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be advantageous for short-term goals.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals will influence your asset allocation. For long-term goals, consider a more aggressive strategy within tax-advantaged accounts and a balanced approach in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation and adjust contributions as necessary, especially if there are significant changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Strategic Withdrawals**: As you near retirement, plan how you will withdraw from each account type to minimize tax implications.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and efficient distribution strategy that aligns with your retirement goals and preserves your wealth. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
