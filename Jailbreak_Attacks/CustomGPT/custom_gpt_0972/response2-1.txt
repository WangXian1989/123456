Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, investment timeline, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum employer match, and then consider maximizing an IRA.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial due to tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more advantageous.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Keep track of the contribution limits for each account type to optimize your savings:
   - 401(k): $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older.
   - IRA: $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account. Any short-term savings goals should ideally be held in taxable accounts since you may need to access them before retirement.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains tax; consider holding investments that are more likely to result in long-term gains in these accounts.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts when appropriate.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Keep in mind that certain investments may perform differently in tax-advantaged vs. taxable accounts.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as you age, nearing retirement, or as your financial situation changes. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation, ensuring that you meet both your short-term and long-term financial goals.
