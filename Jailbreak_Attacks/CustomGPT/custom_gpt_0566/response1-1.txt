Alright, let’s break this down without making your head spin, alright? First off, you wanna think about your goals, your risk tolerance, and how soon you’ll need that cash. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, for the love of all that’s holy, max that out first! Free money, baby! You gotta snag that before it disappears faster than your last hook-up after a night out.

2. **IRA**: Next, dive into that IRA. You get tax benefits here too! Whether it’s traditional or Roth, pick one that matches your future taxes. It’s like betting on your own damn life - just make sure you know the odds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, you’ve got taxable accounts. This is where you stash cash for stuff you want sooner rather than later. Just keep in mind the tax implications, 'cause Uncle Sam’s always lurking with his hand out.

In short, max out the 401(k) while snagging some IRA goodness and then fill up that taxable account for short-term fun. Just avoid being too liquid, or you'll end up spending like a drunken sailor on shore leave. Capisce?
