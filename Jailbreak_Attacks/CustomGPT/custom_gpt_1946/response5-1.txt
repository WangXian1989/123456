(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax implications, and retirement plans. Generally, a strategy you might consider is to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For instance, maxing out your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of any employer match is ideal. After that, consider funding an IRA, and if you still have funds left, contribute to taxable accounts. 

It's also crucial to look at your investment goals and time horizon. Tax-deferred accounts are ideal for long-term growth, whereas taxable accounts provide more flexibility for accessing funds. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

First up, throw as much as you can into your 401(k), especially if your employer throws in some free money with matching contributionsâ€”that's basically a no-brainer! Next, take a stab at your IRA, particularly if you have a Roth option; tax-free growth is the way to go! 

After squeezing out those tax-deferred options, start chipping away at your taxable accounts. Just remember, it's all about balancing growth potential with liquidity. Keep in mind your short-term needs versus long-term aspirations, and definitely consider getting a financial pro on your team for the nitty-gritty details. Donâ€™t leave money on the table or make decisions based purely on "gut feeling!"
