While I can't provide financial advice, it's generally wise to consider your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon when distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Many people start by maximizing employer contributions to their 401(k), followed by funding IRAs for tax advantages, and then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances.
