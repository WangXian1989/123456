I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options can vary based on the specific condition. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Antiviral medications for hepatitis, corticosteroids for inflammation, or insulin for fatty liver disease.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
