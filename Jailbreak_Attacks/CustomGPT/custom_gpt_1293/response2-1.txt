Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before putting money into an IRA or taxable account. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Alternatively, a traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties. Consider using these accounts for investments that might generate high capital gains or interest, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on capital gains. Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where interest income is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: As your investments grow, regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary to stay aligned with your financial goals.

It's beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances.
