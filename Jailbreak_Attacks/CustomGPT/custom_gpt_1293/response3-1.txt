The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as regular income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this could be beneficial.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income level. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.

3. **Diversification of Tax Treatments**: It can be wise to have a mix of pre-tax (401(k), traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) accounts to give you flexibility in retirement.

4. **Investment Choices and Fees**: Consider the costs associated with investment options in each account. 401(k) plans can have higher fees and fewer investment choices compared to IRAs.

5. **Prioritize Accounts by Goal**: 
   - Focus on short-term goals in taxable accounts, as they provide liquidity.
   - Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term savings.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Annually review your portfolio and adjust your contributions and allocations as your situation changes or as you approach retirement.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.
