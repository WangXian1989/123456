Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize your 401(k) contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It's a great option if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement age, as they donâ€™t have the same withdrawal restrictions as retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification and asset allocation**: Regardless of the accounts, ensure your investments are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consult a financial advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, it may be beneficial to consult a financial professional.

It's important to regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.
