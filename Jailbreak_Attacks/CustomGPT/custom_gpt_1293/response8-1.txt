Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider keeping investments with lower turnover or tax-efficient funds here.

3. **Diversify Between Accounts**: 
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for high-growth or higher-risk investments due to the tax benefits.
   - Use your taxable account for investments that produce income or are less tax efficient.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: Younger investors might focus more on growth in their retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to shift toward safer, income-producing investments.

5. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure that your allocations align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored to your specific circumstances.
