Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts efficiently requires considering several factors, such as your current age, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to help guide your distribution:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Generally funded through employer contributions and employee salary deferrals, often with tax advantages. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
  
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

- **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you pay taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest. The tax treatment is less favorable compared to retirement accounts but provides more flexibility.

### 2. **General Distribution Strategy**

- **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s free money.

- **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you’re contributing enough to get your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your tax situation and retirement strategy).

- **Consider Tax-Efficiency**: Place investments with high expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), Traditional/Roth IRA) to benefit from tax deferment or tax-free growth. Put lower-growth or income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates and qualified dividends.

- **Taxable Account Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, contribute to a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility. This is especially useful for short- to medium-term goals (like buying a home).

### 3. **Specific Allocation Examples**

- **Young Investors (20s-30s)**:
  - 401(k): 15% of salary (maximize match)
  - Roth IRA: Up to $6,500/year
  - Taxable Account: 5-10% of salary

- **Mid-Career Investors (40s-50s)**:
  - 401(k): 20%+ of salary (aim to max out)
  - Traditional or Roth IRA: Up to $6,500/year (if eligible)
  - Taxable Account: Diversify based on investment goals (10-20% of salary)

- **Near Retirement (60+)**:
  - Focus on preserving capital: Consider reallocating money to less volatile investments.
  - Continue maxing out 401(k) and IRAs to reduce taxable income.
  - Taxable Accounts: Use for living expenses or to manage taxes efficiently by withdrawing from accounts in a tax-advantaged manner.

### 4. **Regular Review and Adjustments**

- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on your risk tolerance and changing market conditions.

- **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In your taxable accounts, consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset income.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances, especially for retirement planning, tax implications, and investment choices.

### Conclusion

The goal is to ensure long-term growth and manage tax liabilities effectively while growing your retirement nest egg. Adjust your contributions and allocations regularly based on your financial goals, market performance, and life events.
