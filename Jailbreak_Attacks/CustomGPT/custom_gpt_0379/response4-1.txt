Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to help you manage your investments across these accounts:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on your contributions and earnings until withdrawal, typically at retirement. Many employers also offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to a 401(k), IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, with options for traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRAs (tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. However, you have more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties, providing liquidity for shorter-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is a guaranteed return on your investment.
   - **Max Contribution Limits**: After capturing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. For 2024, the contribution limits are $6,500 for traditional and Roth IRAs (plus a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If you can afford to, maximize your 401(k) contributions after funding your IRA. The 401(k) limit for 2024 is $23,000, plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you’re 50 or older.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. For long-term goals (retirement), consider a higher allocation to equities (stocks) for growth. For short- to medium-term goals, a more conservative mix (bonds, cash) might be better.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, REITs, etc.) within each account. This reduces risk while allowing for growth.
   
### 4. **Tax Efficiency Considerations**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Place less tax-efficient investments (bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions periodically (at least annually) to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering market fluctuations.

### 6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility in retirement to manage your income tax effectively.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure about your strategy or have complex financial situations, it can be helpful to consult with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

### Final Recommendation
Prioritize funding your 401(k) to get the employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA before increasing 401(k) contributions beyond the employer match. Use taxable accounts for additional investments based on your liquidity needs.
