Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires a strategy that balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and your individual financial goals. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA as well. Both offer tax advantages, but Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Bracket and Tax Implications**:
   - In a traditional 401(k) and IRA, contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. If you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, these accounts may be more beneficial.
   - Roth accounts are funded with after-tax dollars, which can be ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate assets across different account types to balance tax exposure. For example, keep investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to allow for tax-free growth.
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

4. **Account Type Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on employer stock, if you have any, and diversified funds.
   - **IRA**: Consider a mix of equities, bonds, and perhaps alternative investments for growth while deferring tax.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate long-term capital gains and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions. 

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw money in retirement. Typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, to minimize taxes on social security and other income in retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For a personalized strategy considering your unique financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

This strategy should evolve as you progress through different life stages, so regular reviews are essential.
