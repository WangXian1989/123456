When considering the optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be taken into account, such as your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable if it fits within your budget.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 

2. **Assess Tax Implications for Each Account Type:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can provide flexibility with withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes. Prioritize using this account for funds you'll need in the short term or for investments that generate capital gains, such as stocks.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to minimize risk.
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to optimize your overall tax situation.

4. **Periodic Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

This distribution strategy seeks to optimize your tax situation while ensuring that you are well-prepared for retirement. Always consider seeking specific financial advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
