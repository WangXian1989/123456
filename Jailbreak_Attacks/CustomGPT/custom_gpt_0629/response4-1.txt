To distribute your investments effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Focus on growing this tax-deferred asset, particularly if you receive employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess your current and expected future tax rates when choosing between them.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes. Prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Define your retirement goals and time frame. For longer time horizons, you might opt for more aggressive investments, while closer timeframes may require conservative strategies.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on risk tolerance. Adjust the mix between accounts based on the tax implications of each.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This can prevent overexposure to certain investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds from each account for retirement. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

By using these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
