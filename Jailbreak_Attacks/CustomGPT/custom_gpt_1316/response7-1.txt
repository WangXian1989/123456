The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Once you meet that match, consider how much you want to allocate based on your overall retirement savings strategy.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA can provide tax advantages. The choice between them depends on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). Max out contributions if feasible, as IRAs often have lower fees and more investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be useful for goals outside of retirement, as they offer more flexibility without penalties for withdrawal. They may not provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but can be beneficial for short-term goals or investment strategies that involve frequent trading.

**Allocation Strategy**: Start by filling up your 401(k) to get the match, then move on to the IRA contributions. Once those are maximized, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. Ensure that you consider the specific investment options available in each account and adjust your asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Finally, regularly review your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and market conditions. It's also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized assistance based on your financial situation.
