Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money and an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Funding the 401(k):** If you still have the capacity to save, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you have maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider opening or contributing to a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds before retirement without penalties.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments within these accounts are diversified across asset classes to manage risks effectively. Consider a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.
