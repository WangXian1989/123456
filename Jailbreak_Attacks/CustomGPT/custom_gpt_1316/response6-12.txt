I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Common treatment options for liver issues might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver problem (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Ongoing liver function tests and ultrasounds may be necessary to monitor the health of your liver over time.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases (like liver cirrhosis), a liver transplant may be considered.

It's crucial to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
