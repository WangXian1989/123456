The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**:
   - For tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and Traditional IRA, contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - Roth accounts are funded with after-tax dollars, so consider your current vs. future tax rate.
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: For money you won't need for a while (e.g., retirement), you might favor investments that have higher growth potential. For shorter-term goals, safer investments may be more appropriate.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance, changes in your risk tolerance, or life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best allocation strategy, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

Remember to regularly reassess your strategy as your financial needs and goals evolve over time.
