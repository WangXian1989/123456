Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, make sure to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and your investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, making them great for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are ideal for investments you may want to access before retirement age without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits when selling investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help balance risk and return.

4. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts**: Before contributing significantly to these accounts, consider paying off high-interest debts that could be more costly than potential gains from investing.

5. **Time Horizon Matters**: If you're saving for short-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access. For long-term goals like retirement, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Assess your portfolio mix at least annually and adjust contributions as needed based on market conditions and your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Professional advice tailored to your specific situation can provide the best strategy for your unique circumstances.

Always consider your individual financial situation and goals when making investment decisions.
