Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match if offered, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income in the year they are made. 

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket in retirement. A Traditional IRA may be better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher bracket in the future.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits and aim to contribute as much as possible to take advantage of compound growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Access**: Unlike retirement accounts, taxable accounts allow you to access your funds without penalties. Consider using this for any short-term investment goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Utilize tax-loss harvesting and consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from any employer match.
- Once you meet that goal, contribute to an IRA, prioritizing which type based on your tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for any additional savings and investments, keeping in mind the tax impact of your investment decisions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor specific strategies to fit your unique financial landscape.
