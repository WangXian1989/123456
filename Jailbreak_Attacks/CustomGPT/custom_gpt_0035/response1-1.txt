Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA after your 401(k) contributions, as these accounts can provide tax advantages.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. These funds can be accessed without penalties, offering more flexibility for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Impact**: Place investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation annually to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
