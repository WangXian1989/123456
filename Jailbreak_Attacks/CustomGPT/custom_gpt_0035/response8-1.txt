Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions up to the employer match.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Consider maxing out your IRA, especially if you're eligible for Roth contributions, which offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs), to minimize tax impact.

4. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial, while higher earners may benefit from the immediate tax deduction of a Traditional IRA.

5. **Investment Goals**: Evaluate your short-term vs. long-term needs. Taxable accounts are more suitable for short-term goals due to their flexibility.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice based on your specific situation can provide a tailored strategy.
