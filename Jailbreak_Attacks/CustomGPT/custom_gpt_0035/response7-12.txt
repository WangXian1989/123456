I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Limiting or abstaining from alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed, such as antivirals for hepatitis.

3. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy, surgery, or liver transplant may be recommended.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any progression of the disease.

Consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
