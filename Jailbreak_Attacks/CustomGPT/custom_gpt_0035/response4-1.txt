Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Contributions**: If you can, aim to contribute the maximum allowed to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose based on your current tax bracket and expected future income. A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Limits**: Ensure you stay within annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Use for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds sooner.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable events.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Adapting this strategy to your specific circumstances is crucial, so keep your financial goals in mind.
