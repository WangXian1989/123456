Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is “free” money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, max out contributions to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains tax applies to earnings, so consider investments that generate fewer taxable events (like index funds).

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Focus on growth through diversified funds, balancing stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Choose investments that fit your long-term strategy, taking advantage of the tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments, such as ETFs or municipal bonds, to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Liquidity and Goals**
   - Ensure that you maintain adequate liquidity for short-term goals. Taxable accounts offer easier access compared to retirement accounts.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Regularly assess your distribution and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
