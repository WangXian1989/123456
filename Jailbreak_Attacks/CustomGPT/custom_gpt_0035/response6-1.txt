To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand the Tax Implications
- **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now; withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
  - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxed on withdrawal.
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. Maximize Employer Contributions
- **401(k):** Always contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** up to the limit, then focus on IRAs.
- **Roth IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth after maximizing your 401(k) to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 4. Balance Based on Your Goals
- **Long-term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged options (401(k), IRA).
- **Liquidity Needs:** Keep some funds in taxable accounts for easy access.

### 5. Review and Adjust Annually
- Assess performance and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, or tax laws.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to your investment distribution.
