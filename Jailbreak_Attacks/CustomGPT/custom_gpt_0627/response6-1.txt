Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize annual contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider both Traditional and Roth IRAs. If you’re eligible for a Roth, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
### 2. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
   - **Taxable Investments**: Use these for investments or savings you may need access to before retirement age or for specific short-term goals. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 3. Diversification of Investments
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and timeline. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be distributed according to your age and risk profile.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Considerations
- **Current Tax Bracket**: High-income years may warrant maximizing contributions to pre-tax accounts (like a 401(k)), whereas lower-income years might make a Roth IRA contribution more advantageous.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement; withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts earlier may lead to higher taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
