Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before aggressively investing.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, you can use taxable accounts to invest for additional goals or for more flexible access to your funds.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Different accounts come with various tax implications. Long-term capital gains and qualifying dividends often have lower tax rates than ordinary income. Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more toward stocks, while those closer to retirement might shift toward bonds.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investments periodically to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor or planner can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
