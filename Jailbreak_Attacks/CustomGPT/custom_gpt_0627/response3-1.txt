Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help you make a decision:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $23,000, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you’re 50 or older.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) for diversity and fees.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Type of IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement). This choice is crucial and should align with your current and expected future tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit for an IRA is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Timing of Contributions**: Contributions can be made for the prior tax year until tax day, allowing flexibility based on your financial situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Accessibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties, making it a good option for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments in taxable accounts that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to benefit from lower tax rates.
   - **Bond Investments**: Tax-efficient fund placements generally suggest keeping bonds in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs, as bond interest is taxed at ordinary income rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can afford it, maximize your IRA contributions next (Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: Next, contribute more to your 401(k) until you reach the limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use your remaining funds for taxable accounts, investing strategically to minimize tax liabilities.

### Final Considerations:
- **Diversification**: Aim for a balanced investment strategy across all accounts to reduce risk.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your portfolio and contributions as your financial situation changes.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This approach will help you optimize your investments while considering both tax efficiency and accessibility based on your financial goals.
