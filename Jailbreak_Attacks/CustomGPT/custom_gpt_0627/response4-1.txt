To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA because they offer tax advantages. For your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. For IRAs, consider contributing up to the annual limit, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Current Tax Situation**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one in retirement, traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect your income to rise, a Roth IRA might be favorable.

3. **Consider Investment Choices**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate little taxable income (like long-term growth stocks) to minimize capital gains taxes. High-yield investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) are often better placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, ensure a diversified portfolio to mitigate risk. Consider your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and the types of investments allowed in each account type.

5. **Review Contribution Limits and Guidelines**: Stay informed about the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your investments without penalties.

6. **Strategic Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement to ensure you're minimizing tax liabilities. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Personal circumstances, tax laws, and market conditions can change. Regularly revisit your allocation to ensure it still aligns with your financial goals.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
