1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms of cirrhosis might be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial.

4. **Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like liver biopsies or even surgeries might be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe cases, such as end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be the only option.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
