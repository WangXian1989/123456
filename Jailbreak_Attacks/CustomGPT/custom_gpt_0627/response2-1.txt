When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, allowing you to lower your taxable income. However, you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are taxed at capital gains rates. Consider using these accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds in retirement accounts for long-term growth with tax advantages.
   - **Shorter-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to sooner or for specific financial goals within the next few years.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - As your accounts grow, periodically rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. 

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Factors like tax rates and your income sources will influence where to withdraw from first.

### Sample Distribution:
- **401(k):** 40%
- **IRA (Roth/Traditional):** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30%

This distribution can be adjusted based on your specific situation and goals.
