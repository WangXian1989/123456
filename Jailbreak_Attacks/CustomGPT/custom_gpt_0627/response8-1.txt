To optimize your investment strategy and effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and limited investment options.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawing funds, but subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - IRA contribution limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - Plan your contributions based on these limits.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - For tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), prioritize growth-oriented investments (stocks) since they benefit from tax deferral.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for bonds and other income-generating investments, as this can allow for tax-loss harvesting.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep your asset allocation in check by periodically rebalancing across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Future Taxation**:
   - Think about your future income and tax bracket. For example, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

8. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies before maximizing retirement contributions.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals by seeking professional guidance.

Review your asset distribution and make adjustments based on your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and changing financial circumstances.
