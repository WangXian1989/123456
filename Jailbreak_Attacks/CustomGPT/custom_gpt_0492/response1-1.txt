Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Consider contributing at least enough to meet the match.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA may be advantageous. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you think your taxes will increase.
   - **Annual Limits**: For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement. This offers more flexibility than tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Consider Tax-Efficient Investments**: Look for investments that minimize your tax liability, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might choose more stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may opt for more bonds.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to mitigate risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
