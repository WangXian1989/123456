Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match since it’s effectively “free money.” Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
- **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax situation.

### 2. Consider Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Deferred Accounts**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
- **Roth Accounts**: If you anticipate higher taxes in retirement, prioritize Roth IRAs for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. Use Taxable Accounts Strategically
- **Investment Selection**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains and minimize taxes.

### General Distribution Strategy
- **60% in Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) + IRA)**
- **40% in Taxable Accounts**
  
Adjust percentages based on your specific situation, such as upcoming retirement age or expected changes in income.

### Regularly Reassess Your Strategy
- Review your allocations annually or when significant life changes occur (e.g., marriage, job change).

This balanced approach enables optimal growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
