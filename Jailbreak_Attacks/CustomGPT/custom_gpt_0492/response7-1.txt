Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals since they are more flexible. However, they may be subject to capital gains tax.
   - **IRA vs. 401(k):** Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible depending on your income level, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize contributions to retirement accounts for long-term growth through compound interest and tax advantages.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds you might need sooner, as these offer more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive the employer match (e.g., 5-10% of your salary).
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed limit, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any remaining funds for liquidity and flexibility while considering your overall investment strategy.

### Final Tips:
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
- Keep an eye on fees and investment options within each account to optimize your returns.
