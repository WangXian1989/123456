Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Therefore, placing investments expected to grow significantly within tax-advantaged accounts can minimize tax liability.
   - For investments that generate income (like bonds), consider holding them in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid interest income taxes in your taxable account.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Make sure your investment allocation across different accounts aligns with your overall portfolio strategy. Maintain a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, think about your withdrawal strategy. Generally, funds should be withdrawn starting from taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs), and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize tax exposure.

5. **Regular Review:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Economic changes or life events might require adjustments to your distribution strategy.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances.
