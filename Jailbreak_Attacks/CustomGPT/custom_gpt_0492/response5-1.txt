Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions here, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for investments that may generate taxable income, like bonds or actively managed funds. Consider holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains tax.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Generally suited for growth-oriented investments. Consider dividing investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Opt for more conservative or tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) or traditional IRA) will be taxed as ordinary income, whereas qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation!
