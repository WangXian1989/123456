Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages can be significant. A Roth IRA is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Contribute to the 401(k)**: If you still have funds available after maxing out the IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) to its annual contribution limit.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for goals outside retirement or for liquidity. Choose tax-efficient investments, like index funds or long-term holdings, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Plan your withdrawals and rebalancing with taxes in mind. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes, while IRAs and 401(k)s may be taxed upon withdrawal.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on market changes, your evolving financial situation, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.
