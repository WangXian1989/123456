Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After ensuring you're getting the full employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax or Roth options. Consider maxing out if you can.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Use tax-efficient strategies, such as holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs may be taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate if held long-term.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be invaluable, especially if your financial situation is complex.

By following these guidelines, you can create a tailored strategy for distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
