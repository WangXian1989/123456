The ideal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to at least contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) if contributions are tax-deductible. Taxes are due on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are taxed in the year they are realized. Consider using taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower taxes, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

3. **Build a Diversified Portfolio**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts. Each account type can serve different investment strategies.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before fully investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in place. Typically, this should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**: Evaluate your short-term and long-term financial goals. Adjust your contributions based on upcoming expenses (buying a home, education, etc.) and your retirement timeline.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor who can create a tailored strategy based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
