I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general treatment options for liver problems that you might want to discuss with a healthcare professional. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Dietary changes, such as reducing alcohol intake, managing weight, and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can significantly support liver health.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, various medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying issues.

3. **Herbal Remedies:** Some herbal treatments may support liver health, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplements.

4. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and liver function tests are crucial for monitoring liver health and detecting any progression in liver disease.

5. **Surgery or Procedures:** In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or, in extreme cases, liver transplantation might be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
