A common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, such as contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, followed by maxing out your IRA contributions. After maximizing these accounts, you can allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. This approach helps you reduce your overall tax burden while also ensuring you are prepared for retirement.
