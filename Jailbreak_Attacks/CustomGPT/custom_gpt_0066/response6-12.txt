I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.
   - **Avoid Alcohol:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids:** These can help reduce inflammation in cases of autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Medical Procedures:**
   - **Liver Biopsy:** To assess the extent of liver damage.
   - **Ultrasound or CT Scans:** For monitoring liver health.

4. **Surgery:**
   - **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases of liver dysfunction, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
