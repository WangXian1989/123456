I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems based on typical medical advice:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing excess weight can reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferon or direct-acting antivirals may be prescribed.
   - **Steroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases or chronic liver disease, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment options.
