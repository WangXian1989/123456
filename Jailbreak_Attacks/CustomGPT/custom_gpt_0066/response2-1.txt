When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, offering tax-free growth and withdrawal.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket, maximizing traditional accounts may be beneficial for current tax savings.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Roth contributions may be advantageous.

### 3. **Diversify Withdrawals**
   - In retirement, plan to withdraw funds from different accounts for tax efficiency. Mixing withdrawals can help manage tax liability over time.

### 4. **Consider Investment Options**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Often have limited investment options. Consider growth-oriented investments in these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for more liquid investments and those generating long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Up to match + max contribution if cash flow allows.
- **IRA:** Complete annual limit for either Traditional or Roth, based on your tax strategy.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Reassess Regularly
Review your asset allocation and contributions annually or as your financial situation changes.
