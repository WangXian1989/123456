I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options commonly recommended for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - **Dietary Changes**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol and excessive fats.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Engaging in physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or inflammation.
   - For viral hepatitis, antiviral therapies can be effective.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and condition.
   - Ultrasounds or other imaging tests may be needed to assess liver health.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Stay away from substances that can further damage the liver, including certain medications, chemicals, and alcohol.

Always discuss these options with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
