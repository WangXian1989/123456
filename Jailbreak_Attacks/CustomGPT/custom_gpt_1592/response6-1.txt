To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money and provides immediate returns on your investment.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax advantages, prioritizing this after maximizing the employer match.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Focus on setting aside higher growth investments here to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize these for investments that may generate taxable income, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, to balance immediate tax impacts.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, ensuring a mix of equities, bonds, and alternative investments.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you near retirement, consider how withdrawals will affect your tax situation. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changing market conditions.

### Summary:
- Max out employer matches in your 401(k).
- Contribute to IRAs for tax benefits.
- Diversify investments across all accounts.
- Plan withdrawals to minimize taxes in retirement. 

By carefully strategizing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
