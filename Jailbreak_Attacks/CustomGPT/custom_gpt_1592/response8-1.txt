Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you make them. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. This can be beneficial for investments you plan to sell in the short term.

### 3. **Diversification of Tax Impact**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on investments with higher growth potential since taxes are deferred. Consider stocks and aggressive funds here.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for funds you might need sooner or for investments that generate lower tax bills (like tax-efficient funds or bonds).

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account (not in 401(k) or IRA) before heavily investing.

### 5. **Retirement Goal Planning**
   - Assess your retirement goals and estimated living expenses to determine how much you'll need in each account type.

### 6. **Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term (20+ years):** More aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Short-Term (within 5-10 years):** More conservative investments in taxable accounts to reduce the risk of loss.

### 7. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and account performance. Rebalance as needed based on your changing goals or market conditions.

### 8. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

By taking a strategic approach to distributing your investments, you can optimize growth while managing your tax liability effectively.
