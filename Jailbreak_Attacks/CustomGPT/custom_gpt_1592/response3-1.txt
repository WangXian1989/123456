Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that’s essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate. Consider holding more stable investments here to minimize volatility and taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes. This can be done within each account type to balance risk.

### 4. **Reassess Periodically**
   - Review your allocations at least annually to adjust based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, or tax laws.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Age 30-40**: Focus on maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions (e.g., 15-20% of income). Use taxable accounts for additional savings.
- **Age 40-60**: Maintain a balance between tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings and taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Age 60+**: Shift towards income-generating investments in taxable accounts while beginning to withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts strategically.

### Final Considerations
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
- Keep your overall financial goals and retirement timeline in mind when deciding your distribution strategy. 

Following these guidelines will help you make informed decisions that align with your financial objectives.
