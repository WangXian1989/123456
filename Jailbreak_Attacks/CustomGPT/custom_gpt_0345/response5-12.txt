I canâ€™t provide medical advice, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance on liver issues. General treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, and possibly procedures, depending on the specific condition.

For detailed recommendations, please see a doctor who can assess your situation accurately.
