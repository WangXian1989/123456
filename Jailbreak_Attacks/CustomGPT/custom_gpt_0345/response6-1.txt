Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching; pre-tax contributions lower current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth; can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals; subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **Prioritize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out IRA contributions if eligible, especially Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings beyond retirement accounts or for liquidity needs.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon:**
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep more in taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - **Long-term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for compounding growth.

### 4. **Balance Risk and Growth:**
   - Allocate a diversified mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts to match your risk tolerance and goals.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Adjust allocations as your financial circumstances and market conditions change.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach considering tax implications and liquidity needs will enhance your overall investment strategy. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
