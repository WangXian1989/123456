To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Prioritize Based on Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce lower tax burdens (like index funds) or hold investments for long-term growth to benefit from lower capital gains tax.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA): Use these for investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds) since they grow tax-deferred.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategies**
   - **Equities**: Generally better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher returns over time.
   - **Bonds**: Can be more tax-efficient in tax-deferred accounts since interest income is taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 4. **Reevaluate Frequently**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust based on performance, changes in market conditions, or shifts in your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - In retirement, strategically withdraw from accounts based on your tax bracket to minimize taxes.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

By focusing on tax efficiency and maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, you can optimize your investments for growth and tax benefits over time.
