Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. The growth is tax-deferred but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes upon selling investments and earned interest, which is taxed as ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Each account has specific contribution limits (e.g., for 2023, $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions possible for individuals over 50). Maximize contributions to retirement accounts first.

3. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Consider your timeline and risk tolerance. Longer-term investments may be suitable for retirement accounts, while shorter-term needs might be better served by taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing heavily. This fund should be kept in easily accessible accounts.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to manage risk while aiming for growth. Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, fund an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible).
3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is funded, increase contributions to maximize your 401(k).
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility and access.

### Example Allocation:
- **First 15% of income**: 401(k) contributions (up to the employer match).
- **Next 10%**: IRA contributions.
- **Remaining savings**: Allocate to taxable accounts.

Make sure to regularly review and adjust allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insight.
