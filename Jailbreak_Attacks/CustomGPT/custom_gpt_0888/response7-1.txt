Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be especially beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Options**: Look into the available investment options and fees associated with your plan.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types of IRAs**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you understand the contribution limits ($6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and over as of 2023).
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often offer a broader range of investment choices than a typical 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties, making them a good option for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Holding investments for over a year can lead to lower tax rates on gains.
   - **Emergency Funds**: Consider using taxable accounts for emergency savings to avoid early withdrawal penalties from retirement accounts.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid funds in a savings account or a taxable account for emergencies (typically 3-6 months of expenses).
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts, especially if you have a high tax rate.
- **Diversify Investments**: Diversify your portfolio within each account type to mitigate risks. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
