To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### Tax Efficiency
1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Invest in more tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Asset Allocation
1. **Risk Tolerance and Goals**:
   - Tailor your investment choices based on how much risk you can tolerate and your investment timeline.

2. **Diverse Holdings**: 
   - Keep a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, considering their tax implications.

### Regular Review
- **Rebalance Occasionally**: Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your financial goals.

Make these adjustments based on your personal financial situation and consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
