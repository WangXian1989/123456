I'm sorry to hear you're facing liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. That said, common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and losing weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat specific diseases, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progress of your condition.

4. **Nutritional Support**: A dietitian can suggest a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to support liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Always seek medical advice for a tailored treatment plan.
