Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is important for tax efficiency and retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you can, contribute the maximum to your Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deferral.

3. **Contribute Beyond Matches**: If you still have funds available, continue to contribute to your 401(k) beyond the match. This can help reduce your current taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short-term or if you want more flexibility. Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Tax-efficient investing can help minimize your tax burden when you withdraw funds.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the type of account, ensure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
