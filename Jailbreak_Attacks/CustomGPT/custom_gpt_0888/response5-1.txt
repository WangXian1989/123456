(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA contributions are maxed out, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you want more liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this plan to your specific situation.

1. **401(k) First**: If your jobâ€™s tossing in free cash for your 401(k) match, jump on that! Itâ€™s like getting a bonus just for showing up. Max it out to snag that freebie.

2. **IRA Time**: Next, think about throwing some cash into an IRA. Go Roth if you want to dodge taxes later; go traditional if you need that sweet, sweet tax break now. 

3. **Go Hard on the 401(k)**: After youâ€™re done with the IRA, crank up those 401(k) contributions. You're trying to juice that retirement fund like youâ€™re prepping for a marathonâ€”no half-measures!

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve milked those sweet tax-advantaged accounts dry, dip into taxable ones. Theyâ€™re handy for stuff you want to get at before retirementâ€”like, say, a rad vacation or a new car!

5. **Spice Up with Diversification**: No one wants to put all their eggs in one basket. Mix up investments across all accounts based on what risks you can handle.
