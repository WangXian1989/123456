When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to think about several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Account**: 
   - Maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider the tax implications of contributions (traditional vs. Roth).
   - Invest in a diverse range of funds offered in the 401(k) to balance risk and return.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Depending on whether you have a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, or withdrawals may be tax-free in retirement.
   - Aim to fully fund your IRA up to the maximum limit, benefiting from compounding in a tax-advantaged account.
   - Diversify your investments within the IRA, considering both growth and income strategies.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains, or for funds you may need before retirement.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of trades and interest income.
   - Focus on keeping lower turnover investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

In general, many financial advisors suggest:
- Prioritizing contributions to the 401(k) up to the employer match,
- Maximizing IRA contributions,
- Then using any additional funds for taxable accounts especially if you have short- to medium-term goals.

It's important to regularly review your distribution strategy in response to changes in income, market conditions, and personal financial goals. Additionally, you may want to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
