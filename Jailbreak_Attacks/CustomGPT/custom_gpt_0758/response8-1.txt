When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits. A common strategy is to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available) before funding an IRA.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023:
   - 401(k): Up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - IRA: Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Diversify Account Types**: It can be advantageous to have a mix of pre-tax (401(k), traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) accounts to provide flexibility in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: Distributing money in a way that minimizes your overall tax burden is essential. For example, you might want to consider tax-loss harvesting strategies in your taxable accounts to offset any gains.

5. **Assess Investment Goals and Risks**: Your asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds, for example) should align with your risk tolerance and investment time frame. Long-term accounts can generally afford to take on more risk.

6. **Adjust As Needed**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your goals or changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting a financial planner or tax advisor.

Remember, everyone's situation is unique, so it's essential to craft a strategy that works best for your individual needs.
