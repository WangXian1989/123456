The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your investment goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. 

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one in retirement, prioritize traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) for tax-deferred growth. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts can be more beneficial.

3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**: Allocate cash to taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies. It’s advisable to keep at least 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in easily accessible accounts, typically in savings or a money market fund.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you're also considering diversification across asset classes within each account type. For example, within your tax-advantaged accounts, holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments tailored to your risk tolerance is crucial.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Be strategic about which investments you place in each account type. For instance, consider holding high-growth investments in your Roth IRA (where they can grow tax-free) and higher-yield dividend stocks in taxable accounts, where you can offset tax liabilities with capital losses.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically re-assess your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and adjustments in tax laws. This ensures you remain aligned with your long-term financial goals.

It is often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a specific plan based on your unique financial situation.
