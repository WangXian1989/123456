(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is often the best first step because of the tax benefits and potential for free money through matches.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have maximized contributions to your retirement accounts and have additional funds, you can invest in taxable accounts. Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider using tax-efficient investment strategies, such as prioritizing index funds or ETFs.

Balancing contributions among these accounts can help you achieve long-term growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! To distribute your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts smartly, think about a few key factors: Your tax situation, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here's a no-nonsense approach:

1. **401(k)**: Go hard on this, especially if your employer matches contributions. Think of it as free money! Crank that up to at least the match limit. Itâ€™s tax-deferred growth, which is a major win.

2. **IRA**: After you've milked the 401(k) for all itâ€™s worth, look at an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth, go for it! Tax-free growth? Yes, please! If youâ€™re eyeing the Traditional model, remember youâ€™ll get the tax break now but pay later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've hit the max for the above, the rest can go into taxable accounts. They give you flexibility but are a tax trap if youâ€™re not careful. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds, to keep those taxes in check.

Play around with the proportions based on your goals, and adjust each year! That balance is where the magic happens.
