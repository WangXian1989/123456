Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions might be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider contributing to a Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Diversify Account Types**: If you foresee being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize funding a Roth IRA or after-tax accounts to exploit tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These should be funded after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility and can be utilized for short-term goals without penalties, but you’ll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**: If retirement is far off, you might favor growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts for potential higher returns. As you near retirement, shift to more conservative investments, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities, a personalized plan considering your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement horizon can be beneficial.

A common strategy is to first contribute to the 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund an IRA (maxing out if possible), and finally allocate additional savings to a taxable account. Adjust percentages based on your long-term goals and current tax implications.
