Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, as this reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce capital gains or dividends. Taxable accounts are more suitable for assets you may need to access before retirement.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Ideally, hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize your tax burden. Growth-oriented investments, like stocks, can be held in taxable accounts since capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across your accounts. Different accounts may have different investment strategies based on their tax treatment.

5. **Rebalance and Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess the performance of your investments and make necessary adjustments based on changes in market conditions or your personal situation.

6. **Future Tax Impact**:
   - Consider your expected tax rate in retirement. If you anticipate a lower tax rate, Traditional accounts may be more beneficial. If you expect it to be higher or the same, Roth accounts may be preferable.

7. **Professional Advice**:
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation and goals.

Balancing your contributions and investment types effectively can enhance your overall returns while managing risk and tax implications.
