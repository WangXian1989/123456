Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize this if your employer offers a match. Consider traditional vs. Roth options based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, this can offer tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged options, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This is beneficial for flexibility, as these funds aren't subject to withdrawal penalties like retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when you might need to access these funds:
   - Long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - More liquidity from taxable accounts if needed sooner.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically to align with changes in goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific circumstances.
