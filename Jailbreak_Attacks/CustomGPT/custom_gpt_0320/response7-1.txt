To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Benefits include tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Further contributions can enhance tax benefits depending on your eligibility and goals.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with low turnover or for funds needed in the near term, as they are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Think about how withdrawals from these accounts will impact you in retirement based on your expected income.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
