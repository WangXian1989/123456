Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth (in the case of Roth IRAs). Prioritize these for higher returns on investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate short-term gains or dividends, which can be taxed at a higher rate.

3. **Diversification**: Allocate investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Long-term Strategy**: Focus on long-term growth, especially in tax-advantaged accounts, to maximize compounding benefits.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unforeseen expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your financial objectives.
