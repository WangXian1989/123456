I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy, balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in certain conditions.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Blood Tests**: To monitor liver function.
   - **Imaging Tests**: Like ultrasound or CT scans to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: If the liver is severely damaged and other treatments arenâ€™t effective.

Consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
