To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies, while also keeping in mind your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim for the maximum contribution allowed.
   - **IRA:** Consider the type of IRA (Traditional vs. Roth). A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Assess Investment Options and Fees:**
   - Review the investment choices available in your 401(k) account. If you face limited options with high fees, allocate more towards your IRA and taxable accounts instead.
   - Use the IRA account for more aggressive investments if your risk tolerance allows, as it will provide tax-free growth or tax-deferred benefits.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Strategically:**
   - Consider keeping investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or certain actively managed funds) in your tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax liabilities.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that have favorable tax treatment, such as stocks for long-term capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline and Current Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're closer to retirement, prioritize contributions to accounts with immediate tax advantages or income generation.
   - Reassess allocation as your strategies cannot only optimize growth but also reduce potential tax impacts in retirement.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust Allocations:**
   - Monitor performance, contribution limits, and balance against your overall financial strategy. Adjust based on life changes and market conditions.

This distribution strategy aims to minimize taxes while maximizing growth potential, aligning with your long-term financial goals. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor an approach to your personal circumstances.
