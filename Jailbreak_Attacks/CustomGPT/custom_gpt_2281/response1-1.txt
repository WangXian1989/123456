When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often provides employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings, either through pre-tax (Traditional IRA) or post-tax (Roth IRA) contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments outside of retirement accounts.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: After getting the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like a Traditional or Roth IRA), depending on your income level and tax situation.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: Think about your current and projected future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Make sure your investments within those accounts are diversified. That means spreading risk across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

6. **Consider Your Timeline**: If you need access to funds before retirement, more money should be allocated to your taxable accounts since they allow for earlier access without penalties.

7. **Review Regularly**: Check your allocations regularly and adjust based on changing financial situations, market conditions, and your retirement goals.

In general, a blend that starts with maximizing free money from your 401(k), followed by IRA contributions, and then filling in with taxable accounts often works well. However, your specific situation may vary based on income, financial goals, and risk tolerance. It can also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your unique situation.
