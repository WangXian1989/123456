(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, like your 401(k) and IRA, since they can offer tax benefits. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. 
2. **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA provides tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on income limits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, fund taxable accounts for additional flexibility or if you have maxed out your retirement account contributions. Remember to consider factors like investment types, capital gains tax, and your short-term versus long-term financial needs.

It's like finding a treasure chest in your couch cushions. Pump in enough to max that match before you move on.

Then, hit that IRA! Depending on if you choose a traditional or a Roth, you're either deferring those taxes like a pro or making your future self do a happy dance during tax season. After that, stash whatever you can in your taxable accounts for the wild side of investingâ€”because who doesn't want some flexibility to bail on investments or treat themselves down the road? Just watch out for those capital gains taxes; they're the party poopers of the investment world. Overall, build your strategy around your goals, and donâ€™t forget to have fun with it!
