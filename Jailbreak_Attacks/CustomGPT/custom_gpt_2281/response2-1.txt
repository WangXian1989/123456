Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment needs. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as that’s essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA if you're eligible. These accounts provide tax advantages that can help your investments grow more efficiently over time.

2. **Diversify Your Investments**: Allocate your investments to balance risk and potential return. You might choose different asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, and real estate) in each account based on investment timelines and tax considerations.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning taxes aren’t paid until withdrawal in retirement. These are good for higher-income years.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider prioritizing this account if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These may expose you to capital gains taxes, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Consider keeping bonds or other income-generating investments here to mitigate taxes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance periodically based on market performance and your financial objectives. 

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts, as this provides financial security and liquidity.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and personal financial situations, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice to your circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.
