Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a guide to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often includes employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Good for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible without contribution limits, but earnings are subject to capital gains tax. Good for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available—this is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k), traditional IRA): Best for reducing taxable income now; save for higher income years.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Consider if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility; optimal for short-term goals and investments that generate lower capital gains.

### 4. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Step 1**: Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
   - **Step 2**: Contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional based on your tax situation).
   - **Step 3**: Return to max out your 401(k) contributions (up to the limit).
   - **Step 4**: Fund your taxable accounts if there is non-retirement money to invest.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review and adjust contributions and allocations annually or with significant life changes (job change, marriage, etc.).

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider professional financial advice for personalized strategies to suit your specific needs and circumstances.

This structured approach helps ensure you’re making the most of each account type while working towards your financial goals.
