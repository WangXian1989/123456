To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account's Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which defers taxes until withdrawal. Ideal for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible (for Traditional IRAs) or made with after-tax dollars for Roth IRAs, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes on earnings and dividends. Best for short-term savings or investments you may need access to before retirement.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions Based on Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Aim for the maximum allowable contribution if possible.
   - **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for any additional savings once retirement accounts are maxed out.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on equities within retirement accounts, where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid, safer investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Spread asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on each accountâ€™s tax efficiency.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep your investment allocation aligned with your goals and risk tolerance, adjusting as necessary across all accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized strategies can help optimize your investments according to your financial situation and goals.

This diversified approach should help you maximize your retirement savings while considering tax implications.
