When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. 

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA):** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account (like a high-yield savings account) before heavily investing in other accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Allocate more aggressive investments in accounts where your gains will be tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that you might want to access without penalties. Also, consider holding tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

### 6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

By focusing on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first and strategically managing your taxable investments, you can enhance your overall investment potential.
