Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Income Taxes**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These accounts grow tax-deferred, but you’ll pay taxes when you withdraw funds. Prioritize these accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for short-term goals or for investments you plan to sell. They yield capital gains taxes, so keep tax-efficient investments here.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**
   - Longer investment horizons may prioritize growth (stocks) in tax-deferred accounts. Shorter horizons may favor more conservative investments (bonds) where you might need the income sooner.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Diversify within and across accounts to manage risk. Spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) helps mitigate potential losses.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance. Adjust as necessary based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while considering your individual financial situation is optimal. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized strategies to best suit your needs.
