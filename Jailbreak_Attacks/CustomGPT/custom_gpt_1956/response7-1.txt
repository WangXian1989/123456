Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income level, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k) for tax deductions, but can have different income limits.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax on profits, but can provide more liquidity.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Use each account type to diversify investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) while considering their tax efficiencies.

### 5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting more funds to less volatile investments, especially in your 401(k) and IRA.

### 6. **Long-Term Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Prioritize high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changing goals, or life circumstances.

### Suggested Distribution Approach
1. **Contribute enough to 401(k) to get the employer match.**
2. **Max out IRA or Roth IRA contributions if your income allows.**
3. **Invest in taxable accounts for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.**
4. **Adjust allocations based on life changes and market conditions.**
