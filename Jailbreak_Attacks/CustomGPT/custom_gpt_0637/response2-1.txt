When determining how to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, and the funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions). Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Having both a Roth and a Traditional IRA can help manage taxes in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that incur less tax liability, like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Consider allocating some funds for liquidity, as taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance and age to determine the appropriate asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds).
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, while holding bonds or less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Withdrawal Order**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement, typically starting with taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also recommended to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
