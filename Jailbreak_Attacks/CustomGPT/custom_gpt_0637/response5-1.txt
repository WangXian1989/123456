(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out your IRA (Roth or traditional, depending on your circumstances) and any additional contributions to your 401(k) beyond the match.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that benefit from favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains, or for funds you might need before retirement.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! The best way to juggle your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is about maximizing your gains while keeping Uncle Sam at bay. Hereâ€™s a straightforward strategy:

1. **Get That Match**: First off, donâ€™t leave free money on the table. Max out your contributions to your 401(k) at least to the point where your employer matchesâ€”itâ€™s like a bonus that you just canâ€™t ignore!
2. **Go Heavy on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After snagging that match, throw your next bucks at your IRA (pick a Roth if you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later). The tax benefits here are killer in the long run.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've filled those tax-advantaged spots, anything extra can go to taxable accounts. These are handy in case you want to dip into your savings before retirement or just want that liquidity.

Keep an eye on your risk and goals. And if you can, hit up a financial advisorâ€”they can give you some killer personalized advice!
