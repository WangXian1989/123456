Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize it. This is essentially “free money.”
- **IRA Contributions**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may offer upfront tax benefits.

### 2. Assess Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for higher-income investments to defer taxes.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains, or to maintain liquidity.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your allocation based on how much risk you’re willing to take. Younger investors might favor equities, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account for risk management.

### 4. Regular Review
- Periodically reevaluate your allocations based on performance, life changes, or economic shifts.

This strategy will help you balance growth and liquidity while considering tax efficiency.
