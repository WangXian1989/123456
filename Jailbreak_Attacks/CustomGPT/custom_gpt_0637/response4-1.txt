To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income since they are pre-tax. However, withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth). Consider your current vs. expected future tax rate when choosing.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t provide tax advantages during contributions. Keep in mind capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before committing large amounts to long-term accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Define your goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.). Long-term investments can often tolerate more risk.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets considering your risk tolerance. Typically, higher-risk investments are better suited for Roth IRAs and taxable accounts, where you could benefit more from long-term growth.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Aim to contribute consistently across all accounts rather than trying to time the market.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation still aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be beneficial to address your specific financial situation.

This diversified approach can help optimize your retirement savings while considering tax implications.
