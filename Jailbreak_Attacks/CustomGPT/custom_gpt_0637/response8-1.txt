Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high contribution limit and your employer offers matching, put more here until you hit the match.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA or traditional IRA for potential tax benefits, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, start investing in a taxable account. This provides flexibility and access to funds if needed without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Generally, stock investments grow best in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds and cash may be better suited for taxable accounts due to their income generation and tax implications.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Invest tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts and keep less tax-efficient investments (like high-yield bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on market changes and your investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting a professional to tailor a plan specifically to your situation.

Ensure you evaluate your personal circumstances—risk tolerance, time horizon, and retirement goals—when making these decisions.
