1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet improvements (low-fat, high-fiber foods).
   - Regular exercise.
   - Avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures may be necessary, such as ultrasound-guided drainage for complications or surgeries.

5. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In cases of severe liver damage or failure.

Always follow the advice of your healthcare provider and discuss any concerns or symptoms you may have.
