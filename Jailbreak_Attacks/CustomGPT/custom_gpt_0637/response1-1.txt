To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might not yield immediate returns. This can include stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds. Taxable accounts are also useful for goals with shorter time frames, since funds in retirement accounts can incur penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your distribution strategy with your financial goals and timeline. Long-term goals can be more aggressive in growth assets, while short-term goals might focus on safer, more liquid investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced investment across all accounts. This means diversifying by asset class and geographic region to mitigate risks.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and performance. Adjust as necessary based on market conditions and life changes (like nearing retirement).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, engaging a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

Consider your overall tax situation and investment goals when making these decisions.
