Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement account contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age, and they may benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Generally, consider placing higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a Roth IRA) and more stable investments in taxable accounts (like bonds).

5. **Continuous Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and optimize your distribution to meet your long-term financial goals.
