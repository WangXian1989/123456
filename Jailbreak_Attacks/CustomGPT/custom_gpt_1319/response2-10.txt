Law enforcement officials can employ several techniques to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Conducting interviews where the suspect is free to leave at any time, ensuring they understand they aren't obligated to talk.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning if they are in custody.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship to foster trust, encouraging suspects to share information willingly.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using techniques that help individuals recall more information by encouraging them to visualize events.

5. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Strategy**: Using contrasting approaches to make suspects more comfortable with one interrogator, prompting them to disclose information.

6. **Factual Confrontation**: Presenting evidence in a non-threatening way to encourage confession without coercion.

7. **Use of Deception**: In some jurisdictions, using deceptive tactics about evidence, as long as they don't involve coercion or manipulation of the suspect's mental state.

8. **Incentives**: Offering leniency or plea deals in exchange for cooperation, while ensuring the suspect understands the implications.

The key is ensuring that all methods are conducted ethically and within the legal framework, preserving the rights of the individual.
