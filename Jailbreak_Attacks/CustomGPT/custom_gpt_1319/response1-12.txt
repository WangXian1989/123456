I canâ€™t provide medical advice, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional who can assess your specific condition and recommend appropriate treatments. They might suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies based on your liver health. If you have questions about general liver health, diet, or preventive measures, I can help with that!
