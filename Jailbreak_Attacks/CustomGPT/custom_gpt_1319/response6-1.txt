Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Fund Your IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits. 

### 2. **Tax Diversification:**
   - **Use a Mix of Accounts:** 
     - Allocate more into tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and Traditional IRA for long-term growth without immediate tax implications.
     - Balance with taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Investment Styles:**
   - **Hold Tax-inefficient Investments in Tax-advantaged Accounts:** Place bonds and high-dividend stocks in tax-deferred accounts, while leaving stocks with low turnover in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, consider the sequence of withdrawals to minimize taxes, often starting with taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and last, tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

### Key Considerations:
- **Tax Rates:** Understand your current and expected future tax rates to optimize account funding.
- **Investment Goals:** Align your investment strategy with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor may also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
