Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before looking elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. These accounts offer tax benefits, which can enhance your savings growth.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes on investments when sold.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account (not tied up in retirement accounts) to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. For longer-term retirement accounts, you can typically take on more risk, whereas for shorter-term goals, a more conservative approach may be best.

6. **Review Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on any changes in financial situation, retirement goals, or tax laws.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
