Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves careful consideration of several factors, including your current financial situation, investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, ensure you contribute enough to get the full benefit, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,500 for those 50 and older due to catch-up contributions.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a mix of investments based on your risk tolerance (stocks for growth, bonds for stability).

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types of IRAs**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (after-tax) aligns better with your tax situation and where you expect your taxes to be in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for 2024 is $7,000 for under 50 and $8,000 for those 50 and older.
   - **Invest Wisely**: Use this account for investments with a longer time horizon, such as stocks, to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Access**: This is a good place for funds you might need in the short to medium term since they are not tied up in retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investments like index funds or ETFs, which tend to be more tax-efficient due to capital gains distributions.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is balanced, including both growth assets and more stable income-producing investments.

### Additional Considerations
- **Emergency Fund**: Before making major investments, ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account.
- **Tax Planning**: Consult with a tax advisor to understand the implications of withdrawals from different accounts.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your retirement age, lifestyle goals, and risk tolerance.

### General Tips
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.
- Keep an eye on fees associated with each account type, as high fees can erode your investment returns over time.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy that optimizes your resources for both short-term needs and long-term growth.
