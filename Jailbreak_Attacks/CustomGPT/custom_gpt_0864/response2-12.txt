I’m here to help with conflict resolution, not medical advice. It’s essential to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. They can provide personalized guidance based on your specific condition and medical history. If you’re facing conflict regarding your treatment decisions or health concerns, I can help mediate that discussion. Would you like to explore that?
