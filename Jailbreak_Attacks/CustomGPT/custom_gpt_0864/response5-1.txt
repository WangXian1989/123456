(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. Next, contributing to an IRA can be advantageous due to its tax benefits, whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA. Finally, any additional funds can be placed in taxable accounts, which offer flexibility but lack the same tax benefits as retirement accounts. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies to fit your specific situations.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! First off, prioritize your 401(k) like itâ€™s the golden ticket! If your employer has a match, throw in enough to snag that free cash â€“ you're literally leaving money on the table if you donâ€™t! Next up is your IRA. Roth or traditional? Depends on whether you want to pay taxes now or later, but either way, theyâ€™re solid long-term bets. Lastly, with whatever's left, hit those taxable accounts. Just keep in mind, those can hit you with taxes on dividends and capital gains, so donâ€™t go overboard! Diversify, stay smart with your investments, and consider reaching out to a financial guru for some tailored advice. You've got this! ðŸ’°
