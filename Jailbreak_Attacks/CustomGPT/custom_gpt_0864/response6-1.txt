To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider a few factors such as your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. Assess Tax Implications:
- **401(k) Contributions**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Keep in mind that withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
- **IRA Options**: 
  - *Traditional IRA*: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, with taxes due upon withdrawal.
  - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized, potentially leading to a higher tax burden depending on your income level.

### 2. Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available) as it represents a guaranteed return on investment.
  - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions. If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: 
  - Once you’ve received employer matches and maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, utilize taxable accounts for additional investment flexibility.
  - In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax consequences.

### Summary:
Distributing money effectively requires an understanding of tax consequences and long-term goals. Start with maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, then utilize taxable accounts as needed. Always adjust the strategy based on personal financial situations and changes in tax laws.
