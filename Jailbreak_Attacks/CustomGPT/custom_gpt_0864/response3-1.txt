Understanding the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax status, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here's a structured approach to help you decide:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you investing for retirement, a major purchase, or an emergency fund?

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, allows pre-tax contributions which lower your taxable income. Some employers match contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free on withdrawals) depending on your eligibility. Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits or tax benefits like retirement accounts. Suitable for shorter-term goals due to flexibility.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deductible, deferring taxes until withdrawal.
   - Roth accounts are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals, useful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes based on your income level.

4. **Consider Your Age and Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement age, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of retirement tax benefits. Younger investors may prioritize taxable accounts for more flexible access.

5. **Diversification and Risk**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset types (stocks, bonds) regardless of account type to mitigate risks.

6. **Recommendation**:
   - Max out your 401(k), especially if there's an employer match.
   - Contribute to an IRA if you can (consider a Roth if you qualify and want tax-free growth).
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments if you've maxed out your retirement accounts and have short-term financial goals.

7. **Review Regularly**: Annually assess your allocations and adjust as necessary based on life changes and market conditions.

In conclusion, the ideal distribution of funds between your accounts should align with your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
