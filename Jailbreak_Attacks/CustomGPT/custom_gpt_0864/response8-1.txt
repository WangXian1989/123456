To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, making this a good place to hold assets that may generate high taxable income, like bonds. 
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals), consider where you expect to be in terms of your tax bracket at retirement. In general, growth investments like stocks can be good for a Roth IRA due to tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends (which are taxed at a lower rate) or for holding cash or bonds that may be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. Younger investors might lean towards aggressive investments, while those nearing retirement may prefer more conservative allocations.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes regardless of account type. This can help manage risk.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations based on performance and changing goals. Ensure that you are not over-exposed to any asset class.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about your projected retirement income and tax situation. Planning for tax efficiency during retirement can be crucial for preserving your wealth.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
