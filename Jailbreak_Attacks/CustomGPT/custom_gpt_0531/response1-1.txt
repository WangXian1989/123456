Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Max out contributions to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Investment Choices:** Review the available investment options and fees.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Types of IRAs:** Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Maximize contributions if you can. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+).
   - **Tax Diversification:** Consider a mix of traditional and Roth IRAs to balance future tax liabilities.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Favor investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term gains for tax efficiency.
   - **Investment Choices:** You can invest in a broader range of assets than in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **General Strategy:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
   - **Diversification:** Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changing goals.
   - **Consult a Professional:** Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution is one that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
