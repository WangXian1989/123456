To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax or Roth (after-tax), depending on the plan.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds are subject to capital gains tax but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantage**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket, consider a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Shorter time horizons might lean more toward conservative investments, while longer horizons can take on more risk for potential growth.

7. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Plan for potential tax implications in retirement based on how and when you’ll withdraw from each account type.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.
