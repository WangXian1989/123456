Balancing your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy that can help you make informed decisions:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matches and tax benefits. Focus on maximizing contributions to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages, typically with broader investment options. Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is better for your situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but subject to capital gains taxes. 

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with **401(k)** contributions, especially to get any employer match. Aim for at least 15% of your salary if possible.
   - Next, consider fully funding your **IRA** (up to the contribution limit), choosing between Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Equity (stocks) can be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to higher growth potential and tax efficiency.
   - Fixed-income (bonds) may be better in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends or interest.

4. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Regularly assess your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. 
   - Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personalized advice can be invaluable, especially considering your specific circumstances.

By distributing your money thoughtfully across these accounts, you can take full advantage of tax benefits while building a diversified investment portfolio.
