To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax; taxes are due upon withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on capital gains and dividends. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match (free money!).
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, focusing on a Roth if you qualify, for its tax-free growth benefits.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

4. **Emergency Fund and Accessibility**:
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid form (like savings accounts) before heavily investing in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - Consider your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and adjust your contributions accordingly.
   - Rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across different account types, taking full advantage of tax benefits while ensuring sufficient liquidity for your needs.
