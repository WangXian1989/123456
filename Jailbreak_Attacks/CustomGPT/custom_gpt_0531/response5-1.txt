(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on several factors, including your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Generally, the best approach is:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match and contributing to an IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts for goals outside of retirement. These accounts offer flexibility and can be useful for accessing funds before retirement age.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place investments with higher tax burdens (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and those with lower tax burdens (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
