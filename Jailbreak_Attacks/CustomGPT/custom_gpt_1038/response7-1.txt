To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. Consider putting higher-risk investments here since you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals (if you follow the rules). If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are best for shorter-term goals since they donâ€™t offer tax advantages, but you can control when you take gains or losses. Invest in tax-efficient vehicles like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these investments, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Balance your investments based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals across all accounts. For example, place more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

By combining these strategies, you can optimize your investment across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
