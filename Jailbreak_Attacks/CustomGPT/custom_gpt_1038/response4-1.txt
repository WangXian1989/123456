Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This can be beneficial in higher income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, but contributions may not be deductible based on income levels. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. 

3. **Balance Contributions**: After getting the employer match:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing your Traditional 401(k) or Traditional IRA.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, focus on Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)).
   - Use taxable accounts for investing in more accessible, short-term goals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider asset location strategies; keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts, while placing tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Re-evaluation**: If your income changes or tax laws adjust, re-evaluate the distribution strategy. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and changing laws, working with a financial advisor can help tailor an approach that suits your unique situation.

This strategy helps balance the advantages of each account type while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
