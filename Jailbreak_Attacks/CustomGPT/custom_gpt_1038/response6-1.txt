Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximizing Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductibility.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize taxable events.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns across all accounts to avoid concentration in any one area. 

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider your anticipated retirement tax bracket. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s) to manage tax liabilities efficiently.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly rebalance the portfolio across accounts based on performance and changing risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy (by priority):
- **401(k):** 15-20% of income until match maximized, then shift focus to IRA.
- **IRA:** Max out contribution (currently $6,500; $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
Tailor this strategy to your personal financial situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
