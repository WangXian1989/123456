Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often includes matching contributions. Typically, contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement but require after-tax contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Offers flexibility for withdrawals and investments, but capital gains taxes apply on earnings.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **High-Interest Debt:** Pay off any high-interest debts before investing heavily.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After securing the employer match, focus on maximizing contributions to your IRA (either type depending on your income and tax situation).
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Consider your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate during retirement. This can inform whether to prioritize traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) accounts.

### 5. **Invest for Growth:**
   - Typically, it’s advisable to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as they grow tax-free. Reserve bonds or conservative investments for taxable accounts, where they generate interest income that is taxed annually.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Life Stage:**
   - Younger individuals might prioritize growth (more in stocks), while those nearing retirement may shift to more stable investments.

### 7. **Periodic Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market changes.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you’re unsure or your financial situation is complex, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any extra savings, focusing on long-term growth and holding for at least a year to minimize taxes.

This balanced approach allows for tax efficiency while working toward your financial goals.
