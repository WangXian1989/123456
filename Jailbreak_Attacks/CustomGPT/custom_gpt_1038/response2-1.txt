Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here's a general strategy you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** Contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) after maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you qualify. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits (for 2023: $22,500 for 401(k), $6,500 for IRAs, and additional catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - For higher earners, it may be beneficial to prioritize making contributions to a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA to reduce taxable income today.
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket, contributing to a Roth IRA can be advantageous.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon (stocks, bonds, ETFs).

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Understand the rules for withdrawals from each account type, especially when nearing retirement. Tax implications differ significantly.

### 6. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income. Tax-efficient ETFs or index funds can be good options.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation, especially regarding tax implications and long-term goals.

### Sample Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your salary (to get the match).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible (Roth or traditional based on tax strategy).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings after maxing the first two.

Adjust this framework as your financial situation evolves, considering changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.
