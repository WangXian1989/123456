Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-income years or expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, contribute as much as you can to your 401(k).
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends. Consider holding assets with high churn (high turnover) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 4. **Balance Growth and Stability**:
   - Allocate more to growth-oriented assets in tax-advantaged accounts where you can benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage short-term cash needs and minimize taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investment allocations at least annually and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level based on your changing circumstances.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get the match and further contribute based on your retirement timeline.
2. **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit, focusing on the type that yields tax benefits that align with your retirement goals.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds here, focusing on investments that align with your cash flow needs and tax strategy.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Urgency of Need**: Funds in taxable accounts can typically be accessed without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
- **Fees**: Be aware of fees in your 401(k) plan and other accounts, as these can erode returns.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
