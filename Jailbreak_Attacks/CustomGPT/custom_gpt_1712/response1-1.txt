However, your question about distributing money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts pertains more to financial planning than ecommerce law. It’s essential to consider factors like your current financial situation, tax implications, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to understand the distribution:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

### 2. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits to maximize your benefits.

### 3. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Decide if a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) aligns better with your financial goals.
   - **Annual Limits:** Adhere to the annual contribution limits.

### 4. **Taxable Brokerage Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might need to be accessed before retirement or for flexibility in investment strategies.
   - Consider tax efficiency; for example, holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to balance risk and reward.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given that investment strategies can be complex, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
