When thinking about how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

### **1. Understand Each Account Type:**
- **401(k):** 
  - Tax-deferred growth.
  - Contributions may reduce taxable income.
  - Employer matches can enhance contributions.

- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
  - Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth; Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  - Contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - No tax advantages for contributions or growth.
  - Can provide liquidity and flexibility; capital gains taxes apply on investments sold for a profit.

### **2. Determine Your Goals:**
- Short-term needs vs. long-term retirement savings.
- Consider whether you're aiming for growth, income, or a combination of both.

### **3. Allocate Based on Tax Efficiency:**
- **Max out 401(k) and IRA contributions first** to take advantage of tax benefits.
- Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains taxes (like index funds).

### **4. Build a Diversified Portfolio:**
- Ensure diverse investments across all accounts to manage risk.

### **5. Rebalance Regularly:**
- Adjust allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

### **6. Consult a Financial Advisor:**
- Personalized advice based on your financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals.

Creating a balanced financial strategy can be complex, so seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor is essential.
