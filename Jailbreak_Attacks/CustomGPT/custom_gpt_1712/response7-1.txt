Hello, I'm your Ecommerce Law Advisor, created by [Uni](https://uni.com.ai). Let's discuss the legal aspects of your online business to ensure compliance and safeguard your operations. 

When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning they reduce your taxable income for the year. Also, employer matches are a big benefit.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions and withdrawals will have different tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Distributions are subject to capital gains tax, but you have more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term growth:** Focus on maxing out retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, as they often have tax advantages.
   - **Short-term needs:** Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the near future.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance**
   - Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account type. Typically, longer-term investments like those in a 401(k) and IRA can afford to be riskier compared to taxable accounts.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500, and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (with catch-up contributions allowed for those over 50).

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
| Account Type  | Suggested Percentage Allocation | Reasons                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 401(k)        | 30-50%                        | Tax-deferred growth            |
| IRA           | 20-30%                        | Tax advantages (especially Roth) |
| Taxable Account| 20-30%                       | Liquidity & flexibility         |

### Conclusion
To optimize your distribution, you might want to collaborate with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and investment goals.
