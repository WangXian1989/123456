Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions lower your taxable income for the year. Prioritize maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. It's beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal if you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs and aim to maximize them based on your eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts provide flexibility and can be used for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of tax implications on gains; consider investing in tax-efficient funds and holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution as your financial situation and market conditions change.
