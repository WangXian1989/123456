(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a good strategy includes maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For instance, if your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), itâ€™s wise to contribute enough to get the full match first. After that, consider fully funding your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, where withdrawals can be tax-free in retirement. Lastly, any additional savings can be directed to your taxable accounts. Make sure to also assess the investment options and associated fees in each account, as well as the tax implications of withdrawals as you near retirement.
