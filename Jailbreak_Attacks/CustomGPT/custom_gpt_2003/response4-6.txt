To provide a nuanced and comprehensive response, I have a few questions:

1. **What is your very specific research topic?** Be as specific as possible.

2. **What journal do you want to publish in?**

3. **What Methods did you use in your study? Number them.**

4. **What are your main results?** List them.

5. **Which section would you like to write first (e.g., Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion)?**
