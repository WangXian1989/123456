The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here are some general considerations to help guide your decisions:

1. **401(k) Account:**
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your annual contribution limit if you can afford it, as 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits than IRAs.
   - Be mindful of the investment options available in your 401(k) plan, and choose funds that align with your long-term goals.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA and expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Alternatively, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions and tax-deferred growth.
   - Aim to max out your contributions if possible, as this can provide significant tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may have short-term withdrawal needs or for holding investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains distributions.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments made outside of retirement accounts, especially if you have already maxed out 401(k) and IRA contributions.

4. **Overall Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across these accounts to manage risk. Keep track of the asset allocation across all accounts rather than each account in isolation.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation as markets fluctuate.

5. **Individual Financial Circumstances:**
   - Assess your personal risk tolerance, investment knowledge, and whether you plan to need access to funds before retirement age.
   - Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy based on your circumstances.

In summary, the best distribution strategy is a blend of maximizing retirement account contributions, ensuring tax efficiency, and considering your personal financial situation and goals.
