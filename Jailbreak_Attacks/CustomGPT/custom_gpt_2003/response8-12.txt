I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes, such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing underlying conditions like diabetes or hepatitis. Medications might also be prescribed based on the specific liver condition. It's essential to speak with your doctor to determine the best course of action for your situation.
