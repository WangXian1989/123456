Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if thereâ€™s a match. Traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows for pre-tax contributions, deferring taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If you are in a lower tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial due to the upfront tax deduction.

4. **Allocate Funds to Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This flexibility allows you to access funds if needed and invest in a wider range of assets. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments in these accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. Regular rebalancing helps maintain your desired investment strategy.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: Your age and proximity to retirement will influence how aggressively you should invest. Younger investors might favor growth-oriented investments, while those nearing retirement may shift towards more conservative holdings.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
