The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match. It’s effectively “free money” and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible)**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as it allows your investments to grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Traditional IRA Contributions**: If you are eligible, consider funding a traditional IRA as well. Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income level and whether you participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider funding taxable accounts. These provide greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains tax on profits and dividend tax each year.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Assess the tax implications of each account type:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA: Tax-deferred growth, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA: Tax-free growth and withdrawals; contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - Taxable Accounts: No tax advantages, but flexibility on withdrawals; capital gains and dividends are taxed.

6. **Distribution Strategy**: For retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. However, balance your withdrawal strategy by also considering tax implications.

7. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation. Each account type may have different investment opportunities and tax implications.

8. **Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that takes into account your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

9. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you maintain an adequate emergency fund, ideally in a high-yield savings account, before focusing exclusively on investing.

By thoughtfully distributing your savings across these accounts, you can build a robust retirement plan while taking advantage of the tax benefits each account offers.
