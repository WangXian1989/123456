The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Generally, it is beneficial to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth over time.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Decide whether a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is better for you. A traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth may be beneficial.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts do not offer tax benefits, and capital gains may be taxed each year.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider the types of investments you hold in each account. For example, you might want to hold stocks in your taxable account (which benefits from lower capital gains tax rates) and bonds or high-yield investments in your tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals. Adjust your contributions as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will align with your long-term financial goals, risk tolerance, and other individual factors.
