The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match before diverting funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money and a great way to enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can provide immediate tax benefits. If you have a high-income year and expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing this account may be wise.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether you have access to a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Consider the Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices available within your 401(k). If they are limited or have high fees, you may want to prioritize funding an IRA or taxable account where you have more control over investments.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing in these accounts. 

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This offers more flexible withdrawal options and no penalties for early withdrawal, unlike retirement accounts.

6. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, it might be better to pay that down before fully funding retirement accounts.

7. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Tailor your distribution based on your financial goals and time horizon. If retirement is many years away, prioritize accounts with better growth potential.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals and optimizes tax benefits.
