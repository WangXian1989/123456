The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: 
   - For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). The IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50). Ensure you maximize employer matches in your 401(k) first.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes until withdrawal. This is advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but you have both traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (after-tax) options. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow without tax deferral. Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes. Tax-efficient investing strategies, such as holding index funds or ETFs, can optimize returns in this account.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re investing for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), particularly if you're far from retirement age. If you're investing for a shorter-term goal, a taxable account may be more appropriate.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and the time horizon for each goal. Longer time horizons can afford more risk, so you might allocate more into equity within tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts may serve different asset allocations based on their tax treatment and your spending timeline.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Different accounts may grow at different rates, leading to potential imbalances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal financial situations vary greatly. A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances, goals, and tax situation.

In summary, start by maximizing contributions in tax-deferred accounts, consider future tax implications for withdrawals, and tailor your investment strategy based on your goals and timelines.
