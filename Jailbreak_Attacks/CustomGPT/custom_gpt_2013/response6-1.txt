Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Determine if you need the funds in the short term (around a few years) or if they are intended for long-term growth (retirement, for example).
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Understand your comfort level with risk which will inform your asset allocation.

### 2. **Utilize Tax Advantages**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full benefit of this "free money" before allocating funds elsewhere.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. Consider whether a Roth IRA is beneficial based on your current and expected future tax rate.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Generally, this should comprise a mix of stocks and bonds depending on your risk tolerance. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds for diversification.
   - **IRA**: Use an IRA to further diversify your investments with options that may not be available in your 401(k), such as real estate or individual stocks.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments with higher expected returns or that generate capital gains in IRAs or 401(k)s to avoid immediate tax implications. Use taxable accounts for investments generating qualified dividends or for holding cash.

### 4. **Practical Allocation Tips**
   - **Percentage Allocation**: A common framework is to allocate a significant portion (e.g., 15-20% of your income) toward retirement accounts first, then allocate any savings that exceed that amount into taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure the allocation aligns with your original risk tolerance and goals.

### 5. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**
   - **Personalized Strategy**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your unique circumstances and optimize tax efficiency.

By evaluating these factors and creating a structured plan, you can effectively manage and grow your investments across your different accounts.
