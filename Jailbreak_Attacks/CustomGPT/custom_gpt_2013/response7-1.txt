Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful planning and consideration of various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing at least to the level of your employer's match. If you have more to invest, evaluate whether your 401(k) offers low-cost investment options. Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, max out your IRA contributions. A Traditional IRA may allow you to reduce your taxable income, while a Roth IRA enables tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it a good option for younger individuals who anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you want flexibility with withdrawals. Use these accounts for investments that generate capital gains (like stocks), as long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Bonds or income-generating investments may be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts due to higher tax rates on interest income.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments that align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Regularly review your allocation strategy—at least annually or when significant financial events occur (like a job change or market shifts).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you need personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider working with a financial advisor. They can assess your goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial health to help you create a strategic plan.

### Example Distribution Strategy

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match (e.g., if your employer matches 50% up to 6% of your salary, contribute at least 6%).
2. **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions if eligible ($6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023; catch-up contributions available for those over 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining money to taxable accounts, focusing on investment strategies that provide tax efficiency.

By carefully considering these elements, you can optimize the distribution of your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work toward your financial goals effectively.
