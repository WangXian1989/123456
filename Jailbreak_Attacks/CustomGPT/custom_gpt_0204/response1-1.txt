Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Investment Choices**: If possible, choose low-cost index funds or ETFs.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Prioritize these if you have additional funds after 401(k) contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use these for goals outside retirement, such as a house or education.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Advice**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes to reduce risk.
- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they align with your goals.

### Conclusion
Start with maximizing your 401(k) contributions, then fund your IRA(s), and use taxable accounts for flexibility. Adjust based on your unique financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor could also provide personalized insights.
