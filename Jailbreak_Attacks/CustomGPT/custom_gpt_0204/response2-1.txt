Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - Prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts:
     - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income.
     - **IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your situation:
       - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions; pay taxes upon withdrawal.
       - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategies**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Stocks can be suitable for long-term growth, while bonds may be appropriate for stability.
   - **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts for Growth**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of tax implications:
     - Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts are taxed as income.
     - Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate.

### 7. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income until match is met.
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Max out contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining savings after maximizing the above.

### Conclusion
Evaluate your individual situation, possibly with the help of a financial advisor, to tailor a strategy that fits your needs.
