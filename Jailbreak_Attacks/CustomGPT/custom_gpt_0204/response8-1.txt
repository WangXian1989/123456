To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are taxed now; withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed.

4. **Fill Up Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a good mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If you're unsure, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Following this strategy can help optimize your assets while considering taxes and growth potential.
