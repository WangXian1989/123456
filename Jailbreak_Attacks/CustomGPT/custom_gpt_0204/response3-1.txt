Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions if your employer offers a match, and then target the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your strategy (pre-tax vs. post-tax). Annual limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This is especially useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation Considerations**:
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.
   - Place interest-earning assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Review your allocations and contributions annually or after major life changes to ensure they align with your goals.
