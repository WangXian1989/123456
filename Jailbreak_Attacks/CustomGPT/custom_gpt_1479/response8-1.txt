Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Max Out IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. The tax advantages of IRAs can be significant.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using a taxable brokerage account for additional investing. This can provide flexibility since you can access your funds without penalties after a certain age.

4. **Tax-Placement Strategy**: Consider asset allocation strategically:
   - Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize tax impact.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Align your distribution strategy based on your retirement timeline and financial goals. If you're nearing retirement, you might want to focus more on stability, while if you're younger, growth investments may be more appropriate.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: As your investment grows, ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Reassess regularly and adjust contributions accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

These strategies can help you create a balanced approach to your investment distributions, maximizing your long-term financial health. Always consider your individual situation and tax implications.
