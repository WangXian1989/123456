Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize funding your 401(k) to at least the match limit. It's essentially free money!
   - Look into the investment options available in your 401(k) and consider the fees. Some plans have limited choices, which may not be ideal.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.
   - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which could be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - The contribution limits for IRAs are typically lower than for 401(k) plans, so balancing your contributions here is necessary.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If youâ€™ve maxed out your retirement accounts and can afford to save more, taxable accounts are a great way to invest for additional growth.
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of investing in a taxable account, especially regarding capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to manage risk. This can involve a mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs.

5. **Consider Your Timeline**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, you might want to be more conservative with your investments, while younger investors can typically afford to take on more risk.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your circumstances. Balancing these accounts effectively can help you maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
