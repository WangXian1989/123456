When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the optimal strategy often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are a few key considerations and strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Maximize Contributions to 401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions:** Depending on your income eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to sooner or for investment strategies that may not align with tax-advantaged accounts (like certain kinds of bonds that may generate high taxable income).
   - **Investment Focus:** Place high-growth investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth, while placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Age-Based Allocation:** Younger individuals may lean towards higher risk in their 401(k) and IRA accounts while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your allocation based on market conditions and your risk tolerance.

By strategically distributing your investments among these accounts, you can optimize for both growth and tax efficiency over time. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your personal situation.
