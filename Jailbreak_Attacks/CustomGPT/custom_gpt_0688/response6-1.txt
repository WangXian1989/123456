When considering how to effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors, such as tax implications, contribution limits, and your overall financial goals. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This effectively increases your investment without additional cost.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible for a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. Diversify Across Account Types:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are likely to generate capital gains since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Place higher-taxed investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and lower-taxed investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 3. Regularly Review and Adjust:
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly assess the performance and allocation across your accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals, adjusting contributions based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged savings and diversifying effectively, you can create a robust strategy that maximizes growth potential and minimizes tax liabilities over time.
