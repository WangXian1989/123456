Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some best practices to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Consider maxing out employer-matching contributions first.  
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but consider income limits for deductibility.  
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free. This can be beneficial for younger investors expecting higher future tax rates.  
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for contributions you may need access to in the short term. They are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for long-term growth.  
   - **Short-term Goals**: Allocate funds in taxable accounts for more immediate needs.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Higher Risk Assets**: Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.  
   - **Fixed Income**: Bonds may be more suitable for taxable accounts to minimize tax burden on interest income.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize growth potential while adhering to regulations.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio across these accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

### Conclusion
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation. Each individualâ€™s circumstances are unique, and a professional can help optimize your approach.
