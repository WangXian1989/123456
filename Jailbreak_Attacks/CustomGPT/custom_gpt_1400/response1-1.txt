Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Before maximizing retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) and tackle high-interest debt.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you’re 50+). Consider pre-tax contributions for tax deduction benefits, or Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on income limits, consider maxing out contributions ($6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if you’re 50+).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to funds if needed.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Stocks may be better suited for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds and conservative investments can be held in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically reassess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your detailed financial situation.
