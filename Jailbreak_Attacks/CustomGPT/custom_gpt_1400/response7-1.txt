Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Emergency Fund First**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses before heavily investing.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions, especially if offers good investment options.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roths are typically better for younger investors expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay within contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) limit for 2023 is $22,500; IRA limit is $6,500).

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged account contributions, consider taxable accounts for investments you may want to access sooner without penalties.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Think about asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

### 7. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Monitor the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type in retirement (e.g., income tax on 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals vs. tax-free Roth withdrawals).

### 8. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### Example Allocation (Hypothetical):
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA (Roth/Traditional)**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

This can vary based on personal circumstances, so itâ€™s wise to consult a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation.
