Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (if offered). This is essentially free money and important for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you can contribute more, consider maxing out your IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Funds needed within the next 5 years should go into taxable accounts or a high-yield savings account to ensure liquidity and avoid penalties.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: For retirement, prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions. The tax advantages can significantly impact growth.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while holding less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals. Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as income, while Roth IRA withdrawals (under certain conditions) are tax-free.
   - Consult a tax advisor for personalized strategies to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, prioritizing based on your specific needs and goals. Balancing across accounts can help you leverage the tax advantages they offer while still maintaining liquidity for immediate needs.
