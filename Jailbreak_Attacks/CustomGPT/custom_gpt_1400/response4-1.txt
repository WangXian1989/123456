Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, also contribute to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure you're aware of the annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, it's $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Roth accounts are taxed upfront but grow tax-free.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals. Youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes, so these accounts are often best for investments you might need access to before retirement.

5. **Diversification and Asset Location**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts. Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance, your changing goals, and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation.
