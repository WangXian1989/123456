The distribution of your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions if possible, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Consider using a Traditional IRA if you want tax-deduction benefits now and are okay with paying taxes later during withdrawals in retirement.
   - A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as you pay taxes on contributions now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These are useful for funds that you might need before retirement, as they do not have early withdrawal penalties like the other accounts.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, which may lead to lower capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- Prioritize maxing out any employer match in your 401(k).
- Focus on maxing out an IRA for its tax advantages.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and investments that generate less taxable income.

### Recommended Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 30-50%
- **IRA**: 20-40%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-30%

### Tailor It:
Adjust these percentages based on your age, retirement timeline, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor is often a good idea for personalized advice.

Make sure to regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
