To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar benefits to a 401(k), but be aware of contribution limits and income restrictions.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are more flexible and provide liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider this for short-term goals or additional investments.

3. **Debt Management:** If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it off before focusing heavily on investing.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Within each account type, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance, investment goals, and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations in line with market performance and changes in your personal financial situation.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Before investing heavily in these accounts, ensure you have sufficient savings in an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If unsure about your distribution strategy, a financial advisor can offer personalized guidance based on your individual situation.

Always remember that these are general strategies; personal circumstances can greatly influence the best approach for you.
