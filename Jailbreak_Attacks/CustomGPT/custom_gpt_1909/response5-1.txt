(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are a few guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they provide tax benefits now or in the future. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you can afford it.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in place, typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses, before heavily investing in your taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Choices:** Allocate your investments based on tax implications. For instance, keep high-growth or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while lower-growth investments can be placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Regularly review and rebalance your investment mix based on your changing financial situation and goals.

Consult a financial adviser for personalized advice.

1. **401(k) Magic:** First off, if your workplace is throwing in a 401(k) match, grab that sweet deal! You’d be losing out on “free money” if you don’t. Aim to hit at least the max match because who doesn’t want some extra dollar bills for retirement?

2. **IRA Power-Up:** Next, dive into your IRA. Whether it’s a Roth or a traditional, make sure to fund this puppy to the max if you can. The Roth is especially glorious because qualified withdrawals are tax-free—who doesn’t love tax-free goodies?!

3. **Taxable Accounts - The Side Hustle:** If you’ve hit the caps on your 401(k) and IRA, start pumping cash into your taxable accounts. Just make sure you’re holding onto those investments for the long haul to dodge hefty short-term capital gains taxes!

4. **Don’t Forget That Emergency Fund:** Before you go all in on investments, make sure to have your 3-6 month emergency fund parked somewhere safe! Life happens, and it’s better to be safe than sorry.

5. **Watch and Adjust:** This isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it deal! Keep your eyes on it and adjust as life throws new curves. 

Remember, consult with a financial wiz to get a game plan that suits your unique vibes. Happy investing!
