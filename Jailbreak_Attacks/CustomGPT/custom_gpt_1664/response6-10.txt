Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection can make suspects more willing to share information.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique encourages the suspect to recall details of an event by asking open-ended questions.

2. **Legal Procedures**:
   - **Miranda Warning**: Ensuring suspects understand their rights before questioning.
   - **Voluntary Waivers**: If suspects choose to waive their rights knowingly, interrogation can proceed legally.

3. **Use of Evidence**:
   - **Presenting Evidence**: Sharing non-coercive evidence can prompt suspects to provide explanations or confessions.

4. **Psychological Techniques**:
   - **Strategic Silence**: Allowing silence can pressure suspects to fill the void with information.
   - **Framing Questions**: Asking questions in a way that leads suspects to think about the consequences of their actions.

These methods focus on ethical practices within the framework of the law, ensuring the integrity of the interrogation process.
