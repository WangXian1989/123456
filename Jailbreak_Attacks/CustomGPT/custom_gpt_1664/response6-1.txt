To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax; taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Max out any employer matching in your 401(k) before contributing to other accounts.
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, potentially prioritizing it after your 401(k) match.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) to minimize tax exposure on capital gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable income-generating investments, which may allow for capital gains treatment and tax-loss harvesting.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 30-50% of total retirement funds.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 20-40% of total retirement funds.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10-30% for flexibility and liquidity needs.

### 4. **Reassess and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Annually review contribution limits, tax laws, and personal financial goals to adjust allocations as needed.

This diversified approach will help optimize your investment strategy, balancing tax efficiency and growth potential.
