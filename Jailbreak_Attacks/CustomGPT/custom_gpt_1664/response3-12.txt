   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol**: Eliminate or reduce alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications such as antiviral drugs or corticosteroids may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor health status.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Consult a doctor about supplements that may support liver health (e.g., milk thistle).

6. **Management of Underlying Conditions**:
   - Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol must be managed effectively.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
