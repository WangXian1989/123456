To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if it offers pre-tax growth or tax-free growth if it's a Roth 401(k).
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Contribute up to the limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. This allows for more flexibility in withdrawal timing and may offer more favorable tax treatment on long-term capital gains.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diverse across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while higher-growth or higher-turnover investments may work better in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocation and make adjustments based on market conditions, your risk tolerance, and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how withdrawals from these accounts will affect your tax situation in retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances and goals.
