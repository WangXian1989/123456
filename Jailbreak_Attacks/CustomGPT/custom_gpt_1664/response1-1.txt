Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on max contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider maximizing your IRA.
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, either contribute to a Traditional IRA for upfront tax benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investing in a wider range of assets.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that align with your goals and tax situation.
