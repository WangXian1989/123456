I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional who can assess your specific condition. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely based on the underlying cause, such as:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modifications (low-fat, low-sugar).
   - Regular exercise.
   - Avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Other medications based on the specific liver condition.

3. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - Endoscopic treatments for bile duct issues.
   - Liver transplant in severe cases.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Follow-ups with a healthcare provider for ongoing assessment.

Please seek medical advice to find the most suitable treatment for your situation.
