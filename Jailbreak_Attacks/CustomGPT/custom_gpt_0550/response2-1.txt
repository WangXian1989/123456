Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to secure the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Taxes are paid on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k). Consider this if you are eligible for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but can lead to capital gains taxes when selling investments. Consider keeping more conservative or income-generating investments here.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts (e.g., stocks, bonds, index funds) to manage risk effectively.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Always maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so it’s essential to review and adjust your contributions and investment strategies regularly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your specific circumstances, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights.

Ultimately, the right balance will depend on your individual circumstances, including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax situation.
