When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Tax Implications
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Ideal for maximizing tax-deductible contributions.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or tax-free in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes on profits. Use for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends) strategically.

### 2. Balance Growth and Stability
   - **401(k)**: Consider higher-risk investments for long-term growth, as you won’t access these funds until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy as 401(k), but consider a mix of growth and conservative options based on your retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or emergency funds; focus on more stable investments that generate less taxable income.

### 3. Contribution Limits and Matching
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match – it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your benefits.

### 4. Diversification
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes and sectors within each account type to mitigate risk. Diversification is key to long-term stability.

### Conclusion
Evaluate your current tax situation, financial goals, and investment horizon to strategize the best distribution of your money. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your situation changes. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.
