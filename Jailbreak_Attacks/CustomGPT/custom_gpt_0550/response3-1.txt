To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Match contributions if your employer offers it.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars (withdrawals in retirement are tax-free). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. They provide flexibility but are taxed outside retirement accounts.

2. **Prioritize Employer Match**:
   - Start with your 401(k), contributing enough to get any employer match.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After capturing the employer match, max out your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility and future tax expectations).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investing after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, particularly for short-term needs or if you plan to withdraw funds before retirement.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Invest more aggressively in accounts for long-term growth (like IRAs) and adjust your strategy as you approach retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts according to your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions.

7. **Think About Withdrawals in Retirement**:
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds from each account to minimize tax impacts.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.
