Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you allocate your investments effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax benefits. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and other factors.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed at capital gains rates when sold. However, they offer flexibility in withdrawals and don’t have contribution limits.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before making significant contributions to investment accounts.

4. **Financial Goals**:
   - If you're saving for short-term goals (within 5 years), prioritize taxable accounts due to their flexibility.
   - For mid- to long-term goals, utilize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for tax efficiency.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - You could hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth isn't immediately taxed.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on market performance and personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal advice can be invaluable. A financial advisor can help tailor a plan that accounts for your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, potentially 10-15% of your salary.
- **IRA**: Contribute the annual limit ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those over 50) if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, so consider your unique situation when deciding your allocation.
