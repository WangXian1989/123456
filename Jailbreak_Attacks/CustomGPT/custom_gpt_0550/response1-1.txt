Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to maximize this benefit. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and withdrawal rules. Good for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: You can access your funds at any time without penalties, making these accounts suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes**: You'll pay taxes on any gains when you sell investments, but long-term capital gains rates are lower than ordinary income tax rates.

### General Strategy:

- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) to get the employer match, then consider contributing to an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible).
- **Balance Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.
- **Reassess Regularly**: Adjust your contributions based on your changing financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution:
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions to get the full employer match.
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA otherwise.
3. Invest any remaining funds in a taxable account, focusing on long-term investments.
