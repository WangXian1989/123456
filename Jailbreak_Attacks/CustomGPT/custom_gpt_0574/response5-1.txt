Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA. These accounts can grow tax-deferred, which is beneficial for long-term savings.

3. **Roth Options:** If you qualify, consider funding a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free, making it an excellent choice for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need sooner or for investments you want to be more liquid. The capital gains tax is lower than ordinary income tax rates, which can be an advantage for long-term investments.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type, but consider tax implications. For example, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Adjust Based on Needs:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice aligned with your specific situation, itâ€™s beneficial to consult a financial planner.

This diversified approach can help optimize your savings for retirement while balancing tax efficiency and liquidity.
