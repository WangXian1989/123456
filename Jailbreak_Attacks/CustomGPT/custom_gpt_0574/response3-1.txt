Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here up to that match limit. Then, consider maximizing an IRA if you’re eligible.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Your choice may depend on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is especially beneficial for short-term goals or for investments that might generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

6. **Consider Your Goals**: Tailor the distribution based on your specific objectives—short-term (taxable), medium-term (IRA), and long-term (401(k)).

Consulting with a financial advisor could also provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.
