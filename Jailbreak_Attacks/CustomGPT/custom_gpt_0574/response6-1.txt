To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matches and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Provides tax advantages; choose between Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes but offer flexibility in withdrawals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first to leverage tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for assets that generate lower taxes (like qualified dividends) or for short-term savings that may require quicker access.

3. **Allocate Investments Strategically**:
   - Place high-growth, volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating investments that might be taxed favorably.

4. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Periodic rebalancing ensures that your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid premature withdrawals which could incur penalties.

By prioritizing tax advantages and strategically allocating your investments, you can maximize your overall returns and minimize taxes.
