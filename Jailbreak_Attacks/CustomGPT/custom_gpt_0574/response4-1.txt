Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible, as contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect your income to be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA can also be beneficial for its tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for higher-income years to take advantage of tax deductions. 
   - In lower-income years, prioritize Roth accounts or taxable accounts, particularly if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, consider using investments that have higher growth potential (like stocks), as these accounts grow tax-free (Roth) or tax-deferred (traditional).
   - In taxable accounts, lean towards investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind that contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs usually have penalties for early withdrawal. If you need funds accessible for short-term needs, prioritize taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired investment strategy across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your specific situation, it might be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor.

In summary, consider maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, while also maintaining a good balance for liquidity and tax efficiency. Each person's situation is unique, so tailor these strategies to fit your financial goals.
