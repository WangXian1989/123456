When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Employer matching can also boost your savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but incur taxes on capital gains and interest.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term goals. Taxable accounts are suitable for short-term savings, while 401(k)s and IRAs are better for long-term retirement investing.

3. **Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re closer to retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you have a long time to invest, consider maxing out contributions to retirement accounts first.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual limits for contributions: 401(k) and IRA limits can change yearly. Maximize employer matches in your 401(k) before contributing to an IRA.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to manage risk effectively. 

6. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Understand the withdrawal rules of each account type. Penalties may apply to early withdrawals from retirement accounts, while taxable accounts provide easier access to funds.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA.
3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional funds for taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and flexibility.

### Customize to Your Situation:
Consider your financial situation, investments, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
