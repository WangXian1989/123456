Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to secure the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA might be advantageous. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, consider a Roth IRA, where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023, $7,500 for those over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts are best for funds you might need before retirement since they are not tax-advantaged. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months' worth of expenses) before fully investing.
2. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily in your accounts.
3. **Diversification**: Utilize a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments in all accounts based on your risk tolerance.
4. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to ensure you’re consistently investing.

### Reassess Regularly:
- Reevaluate your distribution strategy periodically as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals evolve. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice suited to your specific situation.
