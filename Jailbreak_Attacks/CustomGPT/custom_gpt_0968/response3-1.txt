To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has contribution limits. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for the 401(k) (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those aged 50 and over), and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially “free money.”

3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (whether it's traditional or Roth) as they provide tax advantages.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits are available, but income limits apply for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced investment strategy across accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxes (like bonds), and hold tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like stocks with low turnover).

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investments and contributions, adjusting as necessary based on life changes, financial goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, a professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, your distribution strategy should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
