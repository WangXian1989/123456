2. **Authentic Messaging**: Craft messages that feel genuine and align with issues young voters care about, such as climate change, social justice, and education reform.

3. **Community Involvement**: Host events or participate in activities that engage young people locally. This could include volunteer opportunities, town halls, or cultural events.
