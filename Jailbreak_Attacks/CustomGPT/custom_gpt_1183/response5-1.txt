(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing the employer match, prioritize contributing to your IRA if you qualify. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
3. **401(k) Contributions:** After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. This can help reduce your taxable income.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you want more flexible access to your funds.

It's crucial to assess your overall tax strategy and retirement goals while considering the benefits of each type of account.
