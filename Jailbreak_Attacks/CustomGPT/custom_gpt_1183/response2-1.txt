Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free growth.
   - In contrast, if you anticipate being in a lower bracket, traditional accounts like a 401(k) or traditional IRA might be more beneficial due to tax-deferred growth.

3. **Evaluate Contributions by Age and Timeline**:
   - Younger individuals may focus more on Roth IRAs for the long-term benefits of tax-free withdrawals.
   - As you near retirement, more emphasis might be placed on tax-deferred accounts to reduce taxable income.

4. **Liquid Savings and Taxable Accounts**:
   - Maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, with investments that are less tax-inefficient, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account type, spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and timeline.

6. **Rebalancing and Contribution Monitoring**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on market performance and any changes in your financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution will align with your individual financial circumstances and goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your needs.
