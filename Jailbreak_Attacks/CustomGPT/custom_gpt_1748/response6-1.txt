The optimal strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   
2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds. This can help minimize your overall tax burden.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Longer-term investments could be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts, while you may want to keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes in each type of account to reduce risk and enhance potential returns.

By balancing your investments across all three types of accounts while considering these factors, you can create a robust and tax-efficient investment strategy. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
