The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. This can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met). Decide whether you prefer to pay taxes now (Roth) or later (Traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts won't have the same tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility and access to your money without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to mitigate risks. 

4. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: If you have shorter-term goals (like buying a home), consider keeping more funds in taxable accounts for easier access. For long-term retirement savings, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when you plan to withdraw funds. It may be beneficial to let your tax-advantaged accounts grow longer before tapping into them.

7. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so itâ€™s important to review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your individual financial situation, ensuring that your asset distribution aligns with your long-term financial goals.
