(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. A common strategy involves prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to IRA:** After obtaining the match, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, as they provide tax advantages.
3. **Back to 401(k):** If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, any additional funds can be placed in taxable accounts, where youâ€™ll have more flexibility, but remember the tax implications when you sell investments.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! When it comes to distributing your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it like a money pie. Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **Start with the Employer Match:** Seriously, if your job is throwing free money at you through a 401(k) match, snag that first! Itâ€™s like finding cash in your winter coat pocket.
2. **IRA Party Time:** If youâ€™ve hit that match, shift gears and pump up your IRA. Traditional or Roth, itâ€™s like the VIP section where your money can hang out tax-free or tax-deferred!
3. **Back to 401(k):** Once you've maxed out the IRA, hog some more 401(k) space and fill it up to the max limit. You'll want as much tax benefit as you can snag, right?
4. **Taxable Accounts for Extra Fun:** With tax-advantaged spaces filled, any leftover cash can go into taxable accounts. They arenâ€™t as tax-friendly, but they give you crazy flexibility, like deciding at the last sec if you wanna go to the movies or chill at home.

Just remember to keep an eye out for taxes when you take money out like a hawk! And maybe give a financial planner a shout to really lock down a plan that fits your vibe. ðŸŽ‰
