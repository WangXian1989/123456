When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to take into account:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you may get tax deductions now or tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax and do not offer the same tax benefits as retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term goals. Retirement accounts are suited for long-term growth, whereas taxable accounts provide more liquidity for short-term needs.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+), while IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties, unlike retirement accounts that have restrictions on withdrawals until a certain age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment timeline, you may choose to place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications efficiently.

A balanced strategy often involves contributing to a 401(k) to get employer matches, maxing out IRAs for tax benefits, and using taxable accounts for additional investments once those limits are reached. Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
