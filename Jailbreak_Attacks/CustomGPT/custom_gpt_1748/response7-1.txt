Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to optimize growth while considering tax implications. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to allocate funds effectively:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, focusing on growth-oriented investments since the funds will be tax-deferred until retirement. Consider diversifying across stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income level, consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial. If you're likely to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous because withdrawals are tax-free. Adjust your contributions based on your overall retirement strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts should focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. You might want to allocate assets that you think will generate short-term gains or interest income (which are taxed at higher rates) in your tax-advantaged accounts first.

To summarize, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for any matching contributions, follow up with IRA contributions, and allocate any excess funds to your taxable account with a focus on tax efficiency.
