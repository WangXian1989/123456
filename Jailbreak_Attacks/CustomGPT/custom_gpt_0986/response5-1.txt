(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Then, consider contributing the maximum allowable limit.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, you may want to contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, while a traditional IRA may be better if you want tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not be as tax-efficient. Consider holding stocks or ETFs here since long-term capital gains taxes are typically lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Overall Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor is often beneficial for personalized advice.
