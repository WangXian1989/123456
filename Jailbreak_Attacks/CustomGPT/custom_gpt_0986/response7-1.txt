Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: After meeting your IRA contribution goals, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate more frequent taxable income, such as bonds. This way, you can manage tax efficiency.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to reduce risk.

6. **Review Annually**: Assess your distribution strategy annually to reflect any changes in your financial situation or goals.
