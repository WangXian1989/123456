When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies to think about:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax advantages similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have the same tax benefits but offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits. Max out accounts with the best tax advantages first, like the 401(k) and IRA, before putting money into a taxable account.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all your accounts to manage risk.

5. **Goals and Time Horizon**: Consider your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and your time horizon. Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, whereas long-term retirement savings may be best in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, keep some liquidity in your taxable accounts.

Always consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
