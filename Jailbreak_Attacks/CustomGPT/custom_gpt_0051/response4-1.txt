To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Choose the one that fits your tax situation.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term growth investments, such as stocks or index funds.
   - In your IRA, you can choose a mix of assets that align with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
   - For taxable accounts, prioritize taxable bonds or dividend-paying stocks to manage tax liabilities efficiently.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) now. In retirement, you may withdraw at a lower rate.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts might be more beneficial.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before allocating large amounts to retirement accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and re-balance as necessary based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation and goals.

This approach helps you maximize tax advantages while aligning your investments with your financial goals.
