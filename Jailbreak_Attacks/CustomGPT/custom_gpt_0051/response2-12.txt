I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan. Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Specific medications may be prescribed depending on the liver issue (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Supplements**:
   - Certain supplements like milk thistle may support liver health, but consult your doctor before starting any.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progress.

5. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be considered.

Always discuss with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action based on your specific condition.
