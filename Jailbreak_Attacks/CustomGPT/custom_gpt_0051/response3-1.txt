Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider prioritizing this if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - *Traditional IRA*: Contributions may be tax-deductible. 
     - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Choose based on your expected tax rate during retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account before maximizing retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement. Investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) can help minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments to manage risk, mixing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they reflect your goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help create a personalized plan.

### Example Distribution Approach
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (up to the match)
- **IRA**: Max out the annual contribution limit (if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds after contributions to the above accounts

Adjust these percentages based on your unique situation and goals.
