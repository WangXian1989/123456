1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieve and maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), various medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups with a healthcare provider for liver function tests.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**:
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can prevent further liver damage.

5. **Viral Hepatitis Treatment**:
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis B or C.
