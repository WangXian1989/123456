(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, particularly if it's a Roth IRA where your money grows tax-free.

2. **Assess your tax situation**: Contributions to a traditional IRA and 401(k) are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the present. However, withdrawals are taxed as income. In contrast, contributions to taxable accounts do not receive the same tax deferral benefits but provide more liquidity.

3. **Consider your investment strategy**: Allocate more volatile investments, like stocks, in your retirement accounts to benefit from tax-free growth over time, while utilizing your taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating investments.

4. **Review your financial goals**: Determine your time horizon and risk tolerance, as these factors influence how you allocate your assets.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your unique circumstances.

1. **401(k) First for Free Cash**: Make sure you're maxing out that employer match in your 401(k). It's like a 50% instant return on your investment â€“ donâ€™t leave that on the table! After snagging that sweet employer match, throw as much as you can afford into your IRA. If you're into Roth IRAs, even better â€“ tax-free growth, baby!

2. **Tax Implications Matter**: Think about taxes before you dive in. Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs reduce your taxable income now, but Uncle Sam will definitely come knocking when you withdraw. Taxable accounts are like the wild west â€“ you pay taxes on gains, but you can pull funds anytime, so balance is key to avoid a tax headache down the road.

3. **Mix it Up**: Throw your high-risk playsâ€”think aggressive stocksâ€”into retirement accounts where they can grow tax-free. Keep the boring, stable stuff in your taxable accounts for some nice dividends. 

4. **Donâ€™t Forget Your Goals**: Craft your plan based on how soon you need the cash and how much risk you can handle! 

And hey, if all this feels a bit too overwhelming, just hit up a financial advisor who can help you whip that portfolio into shape. You got this!
