Itâ€™s crucial to consider your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance when deciding how to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings. 

You might choose to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions if it fits your long-term goals. After that, consider making additional contributions to your 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your immediate needs and overall investment strategy. 

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
