When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to account for factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Assess Your IRA Options**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The choice between them often depends on your current vs. expected tax bracket at retirement:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and withdrawals during retirement are taxable.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRAs. In 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re 50 or older) and for IRAs, it is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

4. **After-Maxing Contributions**: Once you maximize contributions to your 401(k) to get the full employer match and contribute to your IRA, consider utilizing taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer more flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes when sold for a profit. Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, such as holding long-term investments to minimize tax impact.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments in all accounts are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your needs.
