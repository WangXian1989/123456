When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account tax implications, investment goals, and your financial situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (whether traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). 

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $20,500 for individuals under 50 (as of 2022)
   - IRA: $6,000 for individuals under 50 (as of 2022)

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider allocating additional funds to a taxable investment account. This can provide flexibility and liquidity with different tax implications.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances. 

This strategy can help optimize your investment growth while managing taxes effectively over the long term.
