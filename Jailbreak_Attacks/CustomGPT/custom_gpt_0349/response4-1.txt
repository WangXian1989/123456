Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax benefits, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free; consider your current and future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on dividends and capital gains; beneficial for short-term needs or lower tax brackets.

2. **Employer Match**: Max out your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for more liquidity.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when youâ€™ll need to access these funds for retirement.

A common strategy is to prioritize contributions to a 401(k) for the match, then shift to an IRA for flexibility, and finally, invest in taxable accounts for liquidity. Adjust based on your specific financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
