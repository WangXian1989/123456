Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for tax-deferred growth and often has an employer match.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Offers tax advantages; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to your funds earlier. Investments in these accounts can be taxed at capital gains rates, which may be lower than your income tax rate.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate assets based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks may be best in tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher growth potential, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts due to their interest being taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match, then contribute 10-15% of your income.
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute the max allowable each year (if eligible).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Taxes**: Understand the tax implications of each account type.
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you will access these accounts in retirement. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
