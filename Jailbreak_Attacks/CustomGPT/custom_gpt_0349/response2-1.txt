To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if matched.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs primarily for long-term investments to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**: If you have specific short-term goals, keep more liquid assets in your taxable account while using retirement accounts for long-term growth.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile and investment strategy.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10%-15% of your salary (up to match)
- **IRA**: Max contribution (up to limit)
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings or leftover funds after contributing to retirement accounts.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.
