To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. Diversification
- **Asset Allocation**: Divide your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and timeline. 
- **Balance Across Accounts**: Maintain a mix of assets across all accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 3. Tax Efficiency
- **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that generate high income (like bonds) here to minimize tax burden on higher-tax accounts. 
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use these for investments expected to grow significantly, benefiting from deferred taxes until withdrawal.

### 4. Regular Reviews
- **Rebalance**: Periodically assess and adjust your allocations as market conditions and your financial goals change.
- **Contribution Strategies**: Consider prioritizing contributions to the account that offers the most tax benefits based on your current income bracket.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution to align with both your financial goals and tax considerations.
