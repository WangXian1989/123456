When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a well-thought-out strategy can help maximize your retirement savings and minimize taxes. Here’s a guide to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts that do not have tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Determine Contribution Limits**
   - Ensure you’re aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account so you can maximize the tax benefits:
     - 401(k): $22,500 for 2024 ($30,000 if 50 or older).
     - IRA: $6,500 for 2024 ($7,500 if 50 or older).
     - Taxable accounts: No limit, but consider tax implications on income and gains.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before considering other accounts. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Max Out IRAs:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA for the current tax year to benefit from tax-advantaged growth. Choose between a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation and retirement goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially if you need flexibility or have short-term goals.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Choose investments suited to each account type. For example:
     - **401(k) and IRAs:** Can handle higher-growth assets due to tax advantages and long-term growth potential.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 5. **Monitor and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your allocations and overall asset mix to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. Rebalance as needed.

### Conclusion
Distributing your money strategically among these accounts can optimize your retirement savings. Start by maximizing employer contributions in your 401(k), consider both traditional and Roth IRAs based on your tax situation, and use taxable accounts for additional flexibility and investment growth. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies based on your individual circumstances.
