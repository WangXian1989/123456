To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be your first goal.
   - **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions next, since these accounts offer tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide potential deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These are suitable for funds you may need access to before retirement without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Awareness**: Consider the tax implications of investments in these accounts, focusing on strategies to minimize tax liabilities, such as tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, adjusting your investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Investment Type by Account**: 
     - Consider holding higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferral benefits.
     - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where they can be taxed at lower capital gains rates compared to ordinary income.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - **Annual Review**: Regularly check and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on market conditions and life changes.
   - **Rebalancing**: Ensure your portfolio stays aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance, altering distributions as needed.

By following these guidelines, you can create a strategy that optimizes your savings and growth potential across all accounts.
