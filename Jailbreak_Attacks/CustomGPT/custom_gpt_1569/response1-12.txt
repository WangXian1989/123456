I'm not a doctor, but I can help you understand some general treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Eating a balanced diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.
3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular check-ups are vital to track liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult your doctor for accurate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your needs!
