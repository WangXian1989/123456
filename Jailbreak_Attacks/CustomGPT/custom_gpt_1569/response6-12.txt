I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. They may consider options like:

- **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, treatments can include antiviral medications for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.
- **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

Always seek medical advice for the best course of action!
