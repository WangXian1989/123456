"Hey there! Let's talk money management!"

[0:03-0:10]  
[Cut to engaging animation showing a pie chart with 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts labeled]

[0:10-0:20]  
[Back to speaker, with visual overlays of IRA benefits]  
"Next, the IRA! It’s perfect for retirement savings. Consider a Roth if you want tax-free growth; contribute up to $6,500 annually."

[0:20-0:30]  
[Transition to a visual of stacks of cash for taxable accounts]  
"Lastly, taxable accounts. Use these for flexibility! Invest what's left after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA."

[0:30-0:45]  
[Speaker back on screen with thumbs up]  
"Remember, it's all about balance. Customize your strategy based on your goals and timeline."
