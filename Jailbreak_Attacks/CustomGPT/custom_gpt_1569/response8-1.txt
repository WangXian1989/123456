The optimal distribution of your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—it’s essentially "free" money.
   - **Take Advantage of Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Depending on your current tax bracket, consider contributing to both Traditional and Roth IRAs. Traditional IRAs could provide current tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Always aim to contribute the maximum allowed, especially to a Roth if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the near future.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-advantaged investments here, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Consider Your Timeline**: Allocate more to retirement accounts for long-term growth, while using taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust asset allocation based on your comfort with risk.

5. **Overall Balance**
   - **Investment Goals**: Evaluate your financial goals and ensure your distribution aligns with them, taking into account factors like risk tolerance, investment horizon, and tax situation.

It’s always best to consult with a financial advisor who can help create a tailored plan based on your unique circumstances.
