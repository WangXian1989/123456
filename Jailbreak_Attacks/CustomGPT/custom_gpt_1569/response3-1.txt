Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Max Out Contributions**: Always aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes on profit. Use for investments you plan to hold long-term to minimize taxes.

3. **Risk Diversification**: Consider the risk and investment options available within each account:
   - Higher-risk investments may be more suitable in tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications on income.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Assess and adjust your asset allocation in each account to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unforeseen expenses.

Lastly, consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
