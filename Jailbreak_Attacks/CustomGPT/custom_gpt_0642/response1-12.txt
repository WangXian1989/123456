I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. They may recommend lifestyle changes such as diet modifications, avoiding alcohol, or medications depending on your specific condition. It's essential to follow a doctor's guidance for proper treatment and care. Take care of your health!
