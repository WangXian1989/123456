When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to recognize the strengths and tax implications of each account type. Here are some guidelines to help you optimize your distribution:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to max it out if you can.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Keep investments that generate high taxable income, such as bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). 
   - Place investments with the potential for high growth (like stocks) in taxable accounts, especially if you qualify for lower capital gains rates.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts to reduce risk. 
   - Monitor asset allocation regularly, making adjustments based on performance and life changes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals carefully to minimize taxes. Strategy may include withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

By focusing on these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money to optimize growth and minimize tax liabilities. Always consider your specific financial situation or consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
