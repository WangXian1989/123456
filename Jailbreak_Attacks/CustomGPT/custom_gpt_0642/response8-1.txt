The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great return on your investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **If Eligible, Contribute to Health Savings Account (HSA)**: If you have a high-deductible health plan, consider contributing to an HSA if you're eligible. Contributions are tax-deductible, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free.

4. **Balance Between Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k), IRA, and HSA), you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. Taxable accounts offer flexibility and can be beneficial if you need access to your money before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, ensure that you have a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. You may want stocks in your 401(k) for long-term growth, while holding more conservative investments in a taxable account to mitigate taxes on interest and dividends.

6. **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. For example, investment income in a taxable account is subject to capital gains taxes, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth. Consider holding investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and overall investment strategy. Life changes, market conditions, and shifts in financial goals may necessitate adjustments to your distribution strategy.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
