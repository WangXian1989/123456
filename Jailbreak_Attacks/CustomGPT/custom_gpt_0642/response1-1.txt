Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contribution as it offers tax advantages either through tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be a good choice.
   - **Roth IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, this could be more beneficial.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure you’re aware of annual contribution limits for each type of account and try to contribute as much as you can within those limits.

4. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - Different accounts may offer different investment options. Choose accounts based on the investments available as well as associated fees.

5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**:
   - Before aggressively investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid savings account.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement, such as saving for a house or education. Keep in mind you may pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

7. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as necessary based on your risk tolerance, changing goals, or market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation.

Remember to review your strategy regularly and adjust as your financial situation or goals change.
