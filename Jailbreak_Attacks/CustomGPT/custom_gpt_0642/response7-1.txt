When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great first step.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing any employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA (Roth or Traditional). These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred, which can be more beneficial in the long run.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts do not offer the same tax benefits, so it's often better to allocate more funds to tax-advantaged accounts first. However, avoid contributing to a taxable account entirely unless you have maximized your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.

4. **Evaluate Investment Options**: Different accounts may offer different investment options. Choose your investments wisely based on the account type, fees, and your investment strategy.

5. **Balance Your Portfolio**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is balanced according to your risk tolerance and retirement goals, regardless of the account type.

6. **Adjust Contributions as Needed**: Regularly reassess your financial situation, tax implications, and overall investment strategy as your needs and market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure about the best strategy for your specific circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial picture.

By following these guidelines, you can create an optimized strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, leading to stronger long-term growth for your retirement savings.
