I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options regarding liver problems. Some general treatment options may include lifestyle changes like adopting a healthy diet, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing any underlying conditions such as diabetes. In some cases, medications or medical procedures may be necessary, depending on the specific liver condition. Please seek medical advice for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment tailored to your needs.
