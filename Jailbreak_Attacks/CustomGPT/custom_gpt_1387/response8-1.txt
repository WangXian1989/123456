When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match first, and then consider maximizing your contributions. These contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes. You can also use tax-loss harvesting strategies in these accounts to offset gains.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) and within each account. This will help manage risk and improve potential returns.

5. **Investment Horizon**: Consider the time horizon for each account. Funds in a 401(k) or IRA are typically meant for retirement, while taxable accounts can be used for both short-term and long-term goals.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual financial situation and help you create a strategy that works for you.

Remember, the right strategy can vary based on individual circumstances including your income, expenses, and financial goals. Make sure to assess your situation regularly.
