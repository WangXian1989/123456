Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. If you can contribute more, consider maxing it out if you are in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Once you’ve maximized your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments within these accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This may involve holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and ensure your investment strategy aligns with changing life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure or have a complex financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy tailored to your needs.

Remember to consider your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when making these decisions.
