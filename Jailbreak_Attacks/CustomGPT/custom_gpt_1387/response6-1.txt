The distribution of your money among different types of retirement accounts such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Balance for Liquidity:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Maintain some liquidity for emergencies or opportunities by allocating funds to a taxable account. This can provide flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - **Investment Choices:** Different accounts may have different investment options. Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Hold Growth Assets in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Keep stocks and growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Hold Bonds and Income-Producing Investments in Taxable Accounts:** This can be more tax-efficient since the interest from bonds is typically taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustments:**
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
