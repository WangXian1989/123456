The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (either Roth or Traditional) for additional tax advantages, depending on which account aligns better with your retirement goals.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications for each account:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits apply, especially if it's a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs have different tax benefits, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends annually, so this should be considered last.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think ahead about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Certain accounts may be more advantageous to withdraw from first based on tax implications.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
