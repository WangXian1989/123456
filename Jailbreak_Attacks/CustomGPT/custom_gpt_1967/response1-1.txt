Ah, the classic conundrum of where to stash your hard-earned cash. Here’s the deal: 

1. **401(k)**: Start by maxing out any employer match. That's free money, and who wouldn't want to grab that? After that, think about your tax situation. If you're in a higher tax bracket, the traditional route can save you some coin now.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, open a Roth IRA. It's like a tax-free party for your retirement. You put in post-tax dollars, but once you're ready to retire, you can withdraw without Uncle Sam poking his nose in. If you can't swing a Roth, a traditional IRA can still offer good tax breaks.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for anything not covered in the other two—think short-term goals or investments you might need access to. Bear in mind the tax implications; qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are usually your friends here.

In a nutshell, balance is key. Prioritize your employer's match, utilize tax-advantaged accounts where you can, and fill in the gaps with taxable accounts. Just remember, no one-size-fits-all answer here; adjust based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Happy investing!
