(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money. Beyond that, consider maximizing contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income level, a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA can be beneficial. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows your money to grow tax-free in retirement. Aim to max out contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility. Investments here can be subject to capital gains taxes, so focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs). 

A balanced approach tailored to your financial goals is key, and consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

1. **401(k)**: First off, you want to snag that employer match like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza at a party. Seriously, donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Next, max it out if you can because that tax deferral is a no-brainer. Itâ€™s like getting a head start in a raceâ€”use it!

2. **IRA**: Think about whether a traditional or Roth IRA fits your life. If youâ€™re not sure, just remember that with a traditional IRA, you get the tax break now, while a Roth lets you keep the loot tax-free later. Do the math based on your income and tax situation to see whatâ€™s best.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve stuffed the retirement accounts to the brim, dive into taxable accounts. They give you flexibility for short-term needsâ€”with some tax implications you wanna stay savvy about. Focus on investments that wonâ€™t screw you over with taxes, like low-turnover funds.

In the end, a mix that resonates with your goals and risk tolerance is the way to roll. And hey, a financial advisor is like having a personal trainer for your money, so donâ€™t hesitate to consult!
