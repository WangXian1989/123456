I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment depends on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Diet and exercise are fundamental. A balanced diet low in sugars and fats can benefit liver health, alongside regular physical activity.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the diagnosis, antiviral medications may be prescribed for hepatitis, while other conditions might require different drug therapies.

3. **Monitoring:** Regular follow-ups with liver function tests to monitor your condition and adjust treatments as necessary.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol:** If you have liver disease, abstaining from alcohol is usually strongly recommended.

5. **Possible Procedures:** In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

Make sure to speak to your healthcare provider for tailored advice!
