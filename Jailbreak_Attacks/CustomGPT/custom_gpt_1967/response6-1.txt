Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a straightforward strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Why:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **How:** Set your contributions to at least the percentage that qualifies for the employer match.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Consider your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket at retirement.
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - After securing the employer match and funding an IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - **Consider:** This lowers your taxable income and grows tax-deferred until you withdraw in retirement.

### 4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**
   - **Purpose:** Invest for short-term goals or for greater flexibility since withdrawals from taxable accounts don’t incur penalties like retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on investments with favorable tax treatments, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline:
     - **Stocks:** For long-term growth.
     - **Bonds:** For stability and income.
     - **Cash/Cash Equivalents:** For liquidity and risk management.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Painstaking as it may be, review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A tailored strategy can be vital; a professional can help optimize your approach based on your unique financial landscape.

This strategy aims for a balanced growth path while considering tax implications and flexibility. Focus on your financial goals, and adapt as necessary!
