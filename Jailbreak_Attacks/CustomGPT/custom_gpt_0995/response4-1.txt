Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: After securing your employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've contributed to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but come with different tax implications.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax but can provide flexibility.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, age, and retirement goals.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Contribute consistently to all accounts. Dollar-cost averaging can reduce the impact of market volatility.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and contribution levels based on changes in income, expenses, or life circumstances.
