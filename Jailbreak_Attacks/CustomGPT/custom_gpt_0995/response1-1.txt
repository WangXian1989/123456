Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Focus on Growth:** Given that 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits, prioritize growth-oriented investments here.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Diversification:** Use this account for a mix of assets, including bonds or income-generating investments, if appropriate.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep funds here for short-term goals and emergencies since it offers easier access.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Start with Employer Match:** Use 401(k) up to the match limit.
- **Maximize IRA Contributions:** Contribute to an IRA next, prioritizing Roth if eligible.
- **Fill Taxable Accounts Last:** Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on lower-tax investments.

### Regular Assessment:
Review and adjust your allocations annually based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
