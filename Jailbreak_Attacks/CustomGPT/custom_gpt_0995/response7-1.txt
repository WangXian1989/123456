To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to receive any company match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you can, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next. These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your savings.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth investments, like stocks or mutual funds, since you'll benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Decide between a Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you can hold investments that generate capital gains or income. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover and thus less taxable income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to reduce risk. Avoid overconcentration in any one account type.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary across all accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As retirement approaches, develop a strategy for when and how to withdraw funds from each account type to minimize tax implications.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
