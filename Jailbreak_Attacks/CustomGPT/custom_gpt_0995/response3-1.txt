Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a guideline to help you allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money and an excellent return on investment.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA next, especially if it’s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal. Favor these for higher-income years.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Good for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Ideal for younger investors or those anticipating significant income growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, especially if you need flexibility without penalties for early withdrawals.

### 3. **Assess Time Horizon and Goals**
   - For long-term goals (retirement), lean more on tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals (e.g., buying a home), prioritize taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. 

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically evaluate and adjust your contributions and investment allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and personal goals.

### Suggested Allocation Example
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA (Roth/Traditional)**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, as they can help refine your strategy based on current tax laws and investment options.
