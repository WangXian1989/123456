Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, employer contributions, investment options, and your financial goals. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to 401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - **Types of IRA:** Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (after-tax).
   - **Contribution Limits:** The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older) for 2023.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates to choose the type of IRA.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Investment Flexibility:** These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for shorter-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Be mindful of long-term vs. short-term capital gains tax rates. Hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.

### 4. **Strategic Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Align investments with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Diversification:** Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets for balanced growth.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance:**
   - **Regular Check-Ins:** Review your allocations periodically and adjust as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - **Tax Implications:** Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts.

### Conclusion: 
A balanced approach usually prioritizes maxing employer contributions in a 401(k), utilizing an IRA for tax advantages, and then considering taxable accounts for flexibility and investment opportunities. Tailor your strategy based on your personal financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
