Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Individual Retirement Account (IRA):** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **401(k):** After securing the match, contribute up to the annual limit. If your 401(k) offers a Roth option, weigh the benefits of after-tax contributions for potential tax-free withdrawals later.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in these are taxed more heavily on dividends and capital gains, so consider keeping less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure you’re diversifying your investments within each account type. This helps manage risk across the board.

### 5. **Consider Future Withdrawals**
   - Think about when you’ll need access to funds. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for early withdrawals without penalties, whereas retirement accounts usually have limits and taxes.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on your performance, market conditions, and changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA/Roth IRA:** Max out contributions.
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional funds go here.

This approach balances immediate benefits with long-term growth potential. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
