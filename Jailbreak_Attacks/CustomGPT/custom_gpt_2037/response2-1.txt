When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep in mind factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA:** Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages either at the time of contribution (traditional) or at withdrawal (Roth). If you're eligible, the Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for long-term growth.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk. Consider your risk tolerance and investment time frame when deciding on the allocation.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (e.g., dividends, interest) since those may be taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains. Tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs can also be beneficial in taxable accounts since they tend to have lower turnover rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary. Life changes or market fluctuations can affect your chosen distribution strategy, so itâ€™s essential to adjust your allocations according to your current financial situation and market conditions.

5. **Consider the Impact of Withdrawals:**
   - Keep in mind your future withdrawal strategy. Evaluate how withdrawals from these accounts could affect your overall tax situation in retirement.

6. **Evaluate Personal Financial Goals:**
   - Align your distribution strategy with your short- and long-term financial goals, whether they are retirement, buying a house, education funding, or other objectives.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you have specific questions or unique financial circumstances, it may be helpful to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

By understanding how each account functions and their tax implications, you can make informed decisions on how to allocate your investments effectively.
