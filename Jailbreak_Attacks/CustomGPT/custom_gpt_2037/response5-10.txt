(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights while conducting interrogations or extracting information from suspects. Methods that respect these rights include:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a good relationship with the suspect can encourage them to provide information voluntarily. Officers can engage in casual conversation and demonstrate empathy.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, is fundamental. Officers must provide this information before any custodial interrogation.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily without coercion is critical. Officers can do this by presenting questions in a non-threatening manner.

4. **Non-verbal Techniques**: Using body language and active listening can make suspects feel more comfortable, leading them to share more information.

5. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique involves asking open-ended questions and allowing the suspect to recount their experience in their own words, which can yield more accurate information.
