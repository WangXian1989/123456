(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: IRAs and 401(k)s offer tax advantages that taxable accounts do not. Prioritize contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts. For example, you can contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**: In your taxable accounts, you might consider holding a mix of low-turnover index funds or tax-efficient investments that generate qualified dividends to minimize tax liabilities. 

4. **Emergency Fund and Other Savings Needs**: Ensure you have enough in your taxable accounts for liquidity and to cover any short-term needs or emergencies.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocations**: As your financial situation and goals change, make sure to regularly reassess your investment allocations.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, the age-old dilemma of juggling your dough! Hereâ€™s how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts in a way that might actually make sense for your lifeâ€”because we all know finance isn't one-size-fits-all!

1. **Get That Employer Match**: First things first, if your company is matching your 401(k) contributions, throw in enough to snag that sweet free cash! It's like finding money on the streetâ€”why would you leave it there?

2. **Tax Strategy**: IRAs (both Traditional and Roth) are your best buddies for building a solid retirement fund. If you can, prioritize maxing these out before throwing cash into taxable accounts. Why pay taxes now when you can push them to later? But make sure to consider your current tax bracketâ€”Roth's good if you think youâ€™ll be in a higher bracket later!

3. **Tax-Efficient ETFs and Low-Turnover Funds**: In taxable accounts, think about holding investments that won't wreck you during tax season. Go for ETFs or index funds that donâ€™t churn (aka, donâ€™t trade too often) to keep those tax bills low and your stress levels even lower.

4. **Liquid Needs**: Don't forget to stash some cash in your taxable account for emergencies and short-term goals. You don't want to be scrambling to access your 401(k) if your car breaks down, right? 

5. **Keep an Eye on Things**: The financial landscape isn't stagnant! Regularly check your allocation and tweak it as you earn, spend, and generally live life. Itâ€™s all about flexibility, baby!

Just remember to consult with a financial advisor to really nail down the specifics. Happy investing!
