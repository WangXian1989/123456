Distributing your money across different investment accounts like your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizons. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. If you're able, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Both 401(k)s and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you won’t pay taxes on these gains until you withdraw them.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments with lower turnover to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments may be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to promote tax-deferred growth, while more conservative investments can be held in taxable accounts.

4. **Liquid vs. Illiquid Needs**:
   - Keep in mind that contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts often have restrictions on withdrawals. Make sure to maintain enough liquidity in your taxable accounts for short-term needs.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Your strategy should evolve as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change. Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio is key to staying on track.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Since each person’s financial situation is unique, consider talking to a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice suited to your circumstances.

By strategically distributing your money among these accounts, you can work towards maximizing your investments and achieving your financial goals while managing tax implications.
