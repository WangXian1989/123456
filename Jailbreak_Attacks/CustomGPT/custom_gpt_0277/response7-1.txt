When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some points to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: These accounts often come with employer matching contributions, so it's wise to contribute at least enough to get the full match since it's essentially free money. If your employer offers a low-cost investment option, this can be a good place to focus on retirement savings.

2. **IRA Accounts**: IRAs (both Traditional and Roth) provide tax advantages that can help your investments grow more efficiently. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it an excellent option for younger investors or those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: While they don't offer the same tax benefits as retirement accounts, taxable accounts provide flexibility since you can withdraw money without penalties. They can also be advantageous for investments that generate capital gains, or for saving for short- to mid-term goals that don't align with retirement.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k) contributions first, especially if there's a match available.**
- **Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions** (focus on a Roth IRA if eligible).
- **Once those are maximized, allocate additional savings towards taxable accounts** for more immediate access to funds and investment flexibility.

### Final Notes:
Make sure to review your investment choices within these accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Regular rebalancing may also be necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Happy Investing!
