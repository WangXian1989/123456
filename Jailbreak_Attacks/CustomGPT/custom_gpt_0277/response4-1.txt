Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends largely on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons for each account type, along with some general strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Pros:**
     - Tax-deferred growth: You won’t pay taxes on investments until you withdraw funds.
     - Employer matching: Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited investment options: You may only have access to a selection of mutual funds.
     - Early withdrawal penalties: Withdrawing before age 59½ usually incurs a penalty along with federal taxes.
  
   **Strategy:** 
   - Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match first. It effectively boosts your investment return.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Pros:**
     - More investment options: IRAs typically offer a broader range of investment choices than 401(k)s.
     - Tax benefits: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Cons:**
     - Contribution limits: There are lower contribution limits compared to a 401(k).
     - Income limits for Roth: High earners may not be eligible for Roth contributions.

   **Strategy:**
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maxing out your contributions there, as the tax-free growth can be advantageous in the long run. If you need the tax deduction, then prioritize the Traditional IRA.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - Flexibility: You can withdraw money at any time without penalties.
     - No contribution limits: You can invest as much as you want.
     - Capital gains advantage: Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Cons:**
     - Taxes on dividends and capital gains: You pay taxes annually on any income generated within the account.
  
   **Strategy:**
   - Use a taxable account for investments that generate capital gains and dividends if you have maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize taxable income.

### Overall Distribution Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, then switch to your IRA for flexibility and potentially better investment options.
- **Max out the IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount to either a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and goals.
- **Finish with taxable accounts**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, utilize taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Regularly Review and Adjust:
- Annually reevaluate your strategy based on changes in income, tax status, financial goals, and market conditions. Diversifying your investments is also key.

Consulting a financial advisor might also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation. Happy investing!
