(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your current tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Generally, it’s advisable to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, especially if they offer tax deductions or matching contributions. After maximizing those, you can consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get that full match. It’s “free money.”
2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might want to consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: These offer the most flexibility for withdrawing funds early if needed, but be aware of the tax implications on capital gains.

Ultimately, it’s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice specifically to your situation.

1. **Max Out the 401(k)**: Definitely pile in enough to snag that employer match. It’s basically a no-brainer—like free beer on a Friday night!
2. **IRA Dilemma**: If you can, go for a Roth IRA. You put in after-tax dollars, and when you’re sipping margaritas at retirement, that’s all tax-free cash! Otherwise, a traditional IRA can still give you those sweet tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your "just in case" funds. They might not have the sweet tax benefits, but they’re liquid and easy to access without penalties. Just keep an eye on your capital gains taxes.

In the end, diversify like you’re creating a playlist—add some of everything to fit the vibe of your financial goals. And hey, if numbers aren’t your jam, consider chatting with a financial advisor! They’ll crunch the numbers while you focus on living your best life!
