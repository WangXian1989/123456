Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a breakdown of how you might approach this:

### 1. **Emergency Fund First**
   - **Ensure you have an emergency fund:** Before allocating to retirement accounts, make sure you have 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid savings account for unexpected expenses.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k) Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Contribute to a 401(k):** Max out your contributions to your 401(k) if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax deductions. Alternatively, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (but be mindful of income limits).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable account. This offers flexibility in accessing funds without penalties and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 5. **Investment Diversification**
   - **Diversify Across Accounts:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that benefit from tax deferral (like bonds) and keep investments in taxable accounts that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs).

### 6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Savings:** Focus on your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for more accessible investments.

### 7. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations across accounts based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 8. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - **Financial Advisor:** Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice that aligns with your specific situation.

### **Summary**
- Emergency Fund ➔ Max Out 401(k) Contributions ➔ Contribute to IRA ➔ Invest in Taxable Accounts ➔ Diversify Investments. 

This strategy balances tax efficiency, liquidity, and growth potential. Remember to adapt your allocations as your financial circumstances and life goals evolve.
