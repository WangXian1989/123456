Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some approaches to consider, each with its pros and cons:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First (401(k) and IRA):**
   - **Pros:** 
     - Contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRA can lower your taxable income.
     - Earnings grow tax-deferred, which can compound wealth over time.
     - Employers may match contributions in a 401(k).
   - **Cons:** 
     - There are annual contribution limits.
     - Withdrawals before age 59Â½ may incur penalties and taxes.

### 2. **Diversify Contributions Based on Tax Strategy:**
   - **Traditional 401(k):** Generally lower your taxable income now, to pay taxes later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Pay taxes now to enjoy tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Good for flexibility, as funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Pros:** Balance immediate tax benefits with long-term tax-free growth.
   - **Cons:** Requires careful planning to manage tax implications of withdrawals.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Timeline:**
   - **Short-term Goals (1-5 years):** Prioritize taxable accounts for easy access.
   - **Medium to Long-term Goals (5+ years):** Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential.
   - **Pros:** Aligns investment horizon with liquidity needs.
   - **Cons:** May limit growth potential if not diversified enough.

### 4. **Maintain a Balance of Asset Types:**
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - **Pros:** Diversification can mitigate risk.
   - **Cons:** Requires ongoing management and rebalancing.

### 5. **Monitor Your Tax Situation:**
   - Pay attention to your income level, as it can affect your eligibility for certain accounts and tax brackets.
   - **Pros:** Helps in strategizing contributions for tax efficiency.
   - **Cons:** May require adjustments based on changing income.

### Conclusion:
It's often wise to begin with contributions to a 401(k) up to the match limit, then fund a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, and finally divert extra savings to taxable accounts. Consulting with a financial planner can provide tailored advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

Happy investing!
