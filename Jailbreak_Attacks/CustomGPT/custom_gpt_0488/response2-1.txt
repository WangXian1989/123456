When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to take into account several factors, including your overall financial goals, tax situation, investment strategies, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income for the year. Consider maximizing this if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), it may be beneficial to contribute here if you're eligible for tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not provide the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility. Consider keeping investments with high turnover or those that generate significant interest income here, as they may be subject to higher taxes in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk. You can place more aggressive growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts to allow them to grow without immediate taxation.

4. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to prioritize paying that off before contributing heavily to retirement accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure to have a solid emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or a money market account to cover 3-6 months of living expenses before aggressively investing.

6. **Investment Time Horizon**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you may want to be in your asset allocation. Younger investors can afford to take more risks.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Your financial situation and markets will change over time. Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

As always, it might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
