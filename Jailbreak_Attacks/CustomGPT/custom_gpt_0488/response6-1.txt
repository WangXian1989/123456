When determining the best way to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and employer matching programs, which can boost your savings significantly.
   - **IRA**: Also has contribution limits, so consider maxing out both accounts if possible.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-term goals**: Funds in these accounts can be invested in more aggressive options since they’re intended for retirement.
   - **Short-term goals**: For funds you may need sooner, consider more liquid and safer investments in your taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - **IRA and 401(k)**: Generally have penalties for early withdrawals; consider using taxable accounts if you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement age.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced investment approach; don’t concentrate your gains or losses in one type of account.

By weighing these factors, you can create a tailored plan that aligns with your risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
