The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributing to accounts that offer tax benefits, such as your 401(k) and IRA. If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes when you withdraw the funds in retirement. On the other hand, Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Depending on your current and projected future tax rates, you may want to prioritize one type over the other.

3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**: Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are likely to generate high returns and taxes (like stocks), while using taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds or index funds).

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investment goals or market conditions change, be sure to rebalance your portfolio periodically. This may involve shifting funds between your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid funds in a savings account or other accessible investments before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have a complex situation or are unsure of how to balance your contributions, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs and circumstances.

By carefully considering these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments that aligns with your financial goals.
