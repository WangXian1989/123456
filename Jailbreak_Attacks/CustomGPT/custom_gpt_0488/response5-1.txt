(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement plans. Generally, a common strategy is to maximize employer contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money." Then, you might consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth) in retirement.

After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate remaining funds to your taxable accounts. This strategy enables you to take advantage of potential tax benefits while also ensuring liquidity. It's always a good practice to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.

First up, smash those 401(k) contributions as much as you can, especially if your employer throws in some matching cashâ€”free money is hard to beat! Next, dive into the world of IRAs. If you want tax-free dough when you retire, go for the Roth IRAs. But if you want to reduce your taxable income now, the traditional IRA is your buddy.

Once you've maxed out those sweet tax-advantaged accounts, then move on to your taxable accounts. Sure, they donâ€™t have the same tax perks, but they offer flexibility and liquidity when you need it. Just keep an eye on taxes with those! And hey, if all this feels overwhelming, don't hesitate to holler at a financial advisor to tailor that strategy to fit your vibe. You've got this! ðŸ’°
