Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). IRAs can provide tax advantages that may benefit your long-term savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed differently than long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might hold more aggressive investments in accounts with a long time horizon (like a 401(k) or IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. For example, holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts may be more beneficial due to interest being taxed at ordinary income rates.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
