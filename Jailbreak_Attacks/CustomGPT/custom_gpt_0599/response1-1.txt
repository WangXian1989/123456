Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) for tax advantages.
   - **Investment Choices**: IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies. 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Maximize contributions** to your 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to your IRA.
- If you have funds left, allocate to a taxable account, focusing on short-term needs and liquidity.

### Additional Tips:
- Regularly review and adjust allocations based on your investment goals and market conditions.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
