Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a balanced approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for max contributions if possible, since these accounts often have higher contribution limits and tax advantages.

2. **IRA**: Utilize a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, as contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate extra funds here. It offers flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for shorter-term goals. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes to reduce risk.
- **Reevaluation**: Periodically review your allocations based on changing financial goals or market conditions.
