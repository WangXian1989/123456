The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: Once you've maximized your IRA, return to your 401(k) and aim to contribute the annual limit (which is $23,000 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility. This can be useful for short-term goals, as you can access these funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider a diversified asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. For example:
   - **401(k)**: Higher growth investments (e.g., stocks) due to potential tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments that align with your retirement timeline, balancing both growth (stocks) and stability (bonds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio according to changes in your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor strategies based on your unique circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax implications.
