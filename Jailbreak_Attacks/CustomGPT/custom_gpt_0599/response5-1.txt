I'm not a financial advisor, but I can offer some general guidelines on how to approach distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This helps you benefit from tax-deferred growth. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, then consider increasing contributions if possible.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a higher income bracket now, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial for the immediate tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility. Since they're not tax-advantaged, focus on investments that generate lower tax liabilities. Consider index funds or tax-efficient ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Diversification**: Balance risk across all accounts, ensuring a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to suit your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your personal financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
