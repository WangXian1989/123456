The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
- **Roth IRA Considerations**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Diversification of Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider holding more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 3. Withdrawal Strategy
- **Strategic Withdrawals**: Plan how and when to withdraw funds to minimize taxes, often by taking funds from taxable accounts first.
- **Account Order for Withdrawals**: Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, tax-deferred accounts second, and Roth accounts last to optimize tax efficiency during retirement.

### 4. Contribution Limits and Matching
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, ensure you're at least contributing enough to receive the full match.
- **IRA Contribution Limits**: Stay aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs to maximize tax benefits.

### Conclusion
- **Evaluate your personal situation** regularly to ensure your strategy aligns with changing financial goals and market conditions.
- **Consult a financial advisor** for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
