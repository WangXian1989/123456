To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Aim to max out contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is best for you, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Contributing to an IRA can provide additional tax benefits.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Consider municipal bonds and index funds to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Since these accounts grow tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth IRAs), you may want to hold higher-growth investments here. Stocks might be a better fit.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on more stable, income-producing investments to reduce taxes on withdrawals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your portfolio distribution and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Future Tax Considerations**: Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement when deciding how much to allocate to each account type. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, speaking with a financial professional can be beneficial.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your money distribution for better long-term growth and tax efficiency.
