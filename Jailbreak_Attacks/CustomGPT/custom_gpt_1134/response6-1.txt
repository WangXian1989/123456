Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
     - Employer matching can enhance savings.
   - **IRA**:
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.
     - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - No tax advantages, but gains are taxed at preferential rates.

### 2. **Investment Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Investments**:
     - Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**:
     - Use taxable accounts for more accessible funds.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider future withdrawal needs from each account type.
   - Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k) and traditional IRA after age 72.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts.
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio based on risk tolerance.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Max out employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA as early as possible.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investing once limits are met in tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
