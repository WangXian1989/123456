To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. This is beneficial for higher-income years.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced allocation across asset classes (stocks, bonds) to mitigate risk.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Consider your time until retirement. Longer time horizons can focus more on stocks for growth, while shorter ones may prioritize bonds for stability.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan withdrawals smartly in retirement, pulling from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.
