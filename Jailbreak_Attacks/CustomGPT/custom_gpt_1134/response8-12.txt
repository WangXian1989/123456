I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that some common treatment options for liver issues include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the cause of your liver problem, prescribed medications might be necessary to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver health can be crucial.

4. **Avoiding Hepatotoxic Substances**: Stay away from drugs and chemicals that can harm the liver.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like a liver transplant may be considered.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
