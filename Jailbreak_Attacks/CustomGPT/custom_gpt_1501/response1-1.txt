Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money!

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If you're not at the maximum contribution limit yet, consider continuing to put money into your 401(k) since contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth), which can lower your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Next, look at contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be a great way to grow your investments tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility, but be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you’re in a higher bracket now, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be beneficial.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the accounts, ensure your investments are diverse and aligned with your risk tolerance.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your situation may change, so it’s good to review your allocation annually or when your financial situation changes.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific needs!
