(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on maxing out your contributions if you can.

2. **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate higher tax liabilities (like bonds or actively managed funds) and for savings outside retirement goals. 

A balanced approach might start with maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

1. **401(k)**: Hit up that employer match like itâ€™s your favorite bar! Free money is a must-have. If you can swing it, try maxing it out. Itâ€™s tax-deferred, which means you can save a pretty penny on taxes.

2. **IRA**: Next stop, your IRA, whether itâ€™s Traditional or Roth depends on how you wanna roll. Go Roth for those sweet tax-free withdrawals later if you think youâ€™ll be swimming in cash when you retire. If youâ€™re getting some major deductions in your current tax year, a Traditional IRA might be your jam instead.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, throw some of that leftover cash into taxable accounts. These are great for investments you might need to access earlier or those with less favorable tax treatment like high-yield bonds. Keep in mind, though, investments here can generate those capital gains taxes.

So, fill up those tax-advantaged accounts first, then let your taxable accounts play! And seriously, always get a financial guru on speed dial for the nitty-grittyâ€”personal finance is personal after all!
