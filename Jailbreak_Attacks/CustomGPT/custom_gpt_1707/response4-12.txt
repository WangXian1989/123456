I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common approaches for liver health. Treatment options may vary based on the specific liver condition. Common strategies include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver function.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the diagnosis, medications may help manage conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Avoiding Toxins:** Staying away from substances harmful to the liver, including certain drugs and chemicals.

5. **Management of Underlying Conditions:** Treating conditions such as diabetes or high cholesterol that can affect liver health.

Consulting a healthcare provider is essential for a personalized treatment plan that suits your specific situation.
