Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching. This is essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit. This helps increase your tax-advantaged savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve optimized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This provides more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that across these accounts, your investments are diversified to balance risk and return, tailored to your financial goals and timeline.

6. **Annual Review:** Regularly review your strategy and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.
