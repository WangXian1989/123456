Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a straightforward strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - **Action:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - **Action:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA gives you tax deductions now.

### 3. **Fill Up the 401(k) Contribution Limits:**
   - **Action:** After maxing out any employer match, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Action:** Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement, or for assets that generate favorable long-term capital gains or dividends.

### 5. **Balance and Adjust:**
   - **Strategy:** Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, tax implications, and changes in your financial situation.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification:** Make sure to diversify your investments across different asset classes.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Consider the tax implications of each account type when making investment choices.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 20-30%
- **IRA:** 15-25%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10-20%
- **Emergency Savings:** 3-6 months of expenses

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice. Happy investing!
