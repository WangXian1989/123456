Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or tax-free in retirement. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on investment growth.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you’re maintaining a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This means not just diversifying asset types (stocks, bonds) but also considering how your investments are taxed.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure to have an easily accessible emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment choices with your long-term financial goals. If you're years away from retirement, a more aggressive investment strategy may be beneficial. If retirement is closer, you might want to shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Recessions and Market Conditions**: Stay informed about the market and adjust your contributions if necessary, focusing on what helps you achieve your goals without sacrificing future income reliability. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies based on your unique situation.
