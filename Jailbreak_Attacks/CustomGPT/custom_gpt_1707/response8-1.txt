To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. It’s free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (especially Roth IRA if you're eligible) before moving to taxable accounts.

3. **Understand Your Tax Bracket:** Consider your current tax situation. If you’re in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be beneficial, while a traditional IRA or 401(k) offers immediate tax deductions that may benefit those in higher brackets.

4. **Diversify Asset Allocation:** Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts. Long-term investments like stocks may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or more stable investments can occupy taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:** Plan for future withdrawals. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility, while tax-advantaged plans may incur penalties if accessed early. 

6. **Review Regularly:** Annually review contributions and performance, adjusting your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment goals.

By taking a tailored approach to each account's features, you can optimize your investment for growth and tax efficiency!
