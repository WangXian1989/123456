The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can afford it, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the match). IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options compared to many 401(k) plans.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are subject to taxes, so consider keeping investments that you expect to hold for a long time (to minimize taxable events) in these accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and timeline. This applies to all account types. 

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you have access to cash for any short-term needs. Having savings in a taxable account may be beneficial for this purpose.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be helpful to work with a financial planner to create a personalized strategy that fits your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution is one that balances your retirement goals with your current financial needs, while taking tax implications into account.
