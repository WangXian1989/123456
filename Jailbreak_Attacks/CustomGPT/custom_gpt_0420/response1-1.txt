Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a breakdown to help you strategize:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match if one is offered—it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Ideal for those looking to save on taxes now.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement (tax-free withdrawals), and a Traditional IRA if you prefer the upfront tax deduction.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow you to access funds without penalties, making them great for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax burdens.

### Strategy for Distribution:
- **Max Out 401(k) First**: Contribute enough to get any match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
- **Prioritize Tax-Efficient Investments**: In your taxable account, focus on long-term investments that are taxed at lower rates.

### General Recommendations:
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes to manage risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and your financial goals.
