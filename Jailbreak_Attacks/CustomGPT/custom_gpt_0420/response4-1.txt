To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the employer match. Consider maxing out contributions if your goal is retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). Depending on your income, you might prefer one type over the other.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for saving beyond whatâ€™s allowed in tax-advantaged accounts or for short-term goals. They offer flexibility but have different tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Distributing your investments across accounts can help manage your tax liability in retirement. For example, having both pre-tax accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and post-tax accounts (Roth IRA) can provide flexibility in withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Each account may have different investment strategies based on tax treatment. Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, lower-growth investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: As your investments grow, reassess your allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk profile and timelines for withdrawals.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize your investment growth and minimize tax liabilities. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your situation.
