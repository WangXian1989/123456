The best approach to distribute funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After securing the match, consider fully funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you qualify. These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance long-term growth.
   - If you can, also contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA) if eligible, as it offers tax benefits similar to retirement accounts.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**:
   - Once your IRA is maxed out, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for emergencies or short-term goals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation and Investment Choices**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to mitigate taxes.

6. **Evaluate Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

Always consider your individual circumstances and adjust the strategy as needed.
