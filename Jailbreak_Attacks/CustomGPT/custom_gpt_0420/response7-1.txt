Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Investment Horizon:**
   - If youâ€™re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA. For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts but consider different investment strategies based on account type. For example, hold more growth-oriented investments in Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for which accounts to withdraw from in retirement to minimize taxes, starting with taxable accounts first.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your total savings.
- **IRA**: 10-15%.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-20%, depending on immediate financial goals.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Regularly reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
