To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k). This reduces your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatments, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

5. **Rebalance Accordingly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and life changes.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars.

7. **Diversify Investments**: Use a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to mitigate risk.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
