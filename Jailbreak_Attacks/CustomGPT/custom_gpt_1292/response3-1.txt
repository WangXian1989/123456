Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If you qualify for a deductible traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, consider maxing out contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**:
   - After maxing out your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit. This can also reduce your taxable income.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties. This can be useful for emergencies or shorter-term goals.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Different accounts may benefit from different types of investments. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) are often better placed in taxable accounts, while investments that generate high levels of taxable income (like bonds) can be held in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances, taking into account tax implications and investment options.

By strategically distributing funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and ensure you are on track for your retirement goals.
