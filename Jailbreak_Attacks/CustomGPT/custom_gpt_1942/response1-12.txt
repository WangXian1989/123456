I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for liver problems. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver issue you're facing, but common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or more advanced interventions such as procedures or surgery in severe cases. Always seek personalized advice from a qualified healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your situation.
