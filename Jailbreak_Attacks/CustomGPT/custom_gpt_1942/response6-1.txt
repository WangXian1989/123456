Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Aim to fully fund your IRA (Roth or Traditional) to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments expected to appreciate significantly, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate broadly across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type.
   - Consider global diversification to mitigate risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or risk tolerance.
   - Maintain your desired asset allocation by selling overperforming assets and buying underperforming ones.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy ahead of retirement, determining the order in which you will access these accounts to minimize taxes and penalties.

Make sure to tailor these strategies based on your individual circumstances, as personal financial situations can vary greatly. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
