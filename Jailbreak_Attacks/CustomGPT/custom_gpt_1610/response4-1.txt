Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and your investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great starting point.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, you may also want to contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). IRAs can provide tax advantages, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions may reduce your taxable income now, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts may generate capital gains taxes on earnings, so consider the timing of withdrawals and sales.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses, typically kept in a liquid, easily accessible account.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your situation, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a tailored distribution strategy that optimally aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.

Determining the best distribution strategy is highly personal and should reflect your unique financial goals and circumstances.
