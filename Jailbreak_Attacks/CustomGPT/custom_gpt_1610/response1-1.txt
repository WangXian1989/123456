Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is an important strategy that can optimize your retirement savings and tax situation. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re over 50) annually. Max out if possible, especially if you have high-income years.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment choices in your 401(k). They often have limited options compared to IRAs. Consider diversifying your investments within those choices.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Types of IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions but tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50). If you can afford it, try to contribute to both IRAs, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs usually have a broader range of investment options compared to 401(k)s, which can help you optimize returns.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement or for specific goals (like buying a home).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Dividends and Taxes**: Be aware of how dividends and capital gains are taxed in these accounts, and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Start with the Match**: Maximize your 401(k) contributions up to your employer’s match.
2. **Fund an IRA**: Next, contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.
3. **Back to the 401(k)**: Once you max out the IRA, go back to your 401(k) and continue to contribute up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Finally, consider investing in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### **Final Thoughts**
Your specific distribution should also depend on your income level, tax bracket, retirement timeline, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide a personalized plan suited to your circumstances.
