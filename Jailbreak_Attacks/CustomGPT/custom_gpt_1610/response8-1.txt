When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often involves a balance between tax efficiency, liquidity needs, investment goals, and retirement timelines. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If you've maxed out your 401(k) or want additional tax-advantaged space, consider funding an IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). A Roth IRA is typically better for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility in withdrawing funds without penalties, though it's less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizons**
   - For long-term growth focused strategies (e.g., retirement), prioritize placing growth-oriented investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Reserve more conservative investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts to manage tax implications on interest income.

### 4. **Maintain Liquidity**
   - Ensure a portion of your investments remains liquid in your taxable account, especially if you may need access to funds before retirement.

### 5. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. This may involve different asset allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment horizons.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals, market conditions, and any changes in your life circumstances.

### Conclusion
Each individual's financial situation is unique, so consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy according to your specific goals and tax situation.
