Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility, as there are no withdrawal restrictions, but they do come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification**: Aim to diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy and risk level, taking into account the different tax treatments of each account.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Withdrawals from a 401(k) or Traditional IRA are typically taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your individual situation, ensuring that your distribution aligns with your long-term financial goals.
