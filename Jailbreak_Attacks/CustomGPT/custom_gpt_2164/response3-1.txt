The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also offers tax advantages; can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax benefits, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for short-term goals.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - After that, consider prioritizing your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, as it provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs provide tax breaks on contributions, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals, such as retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize growth potential.
   - For shorter-term goals, focus on taxable accounts since they offer liquidity.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on financial goals, market conditions, and changes in your life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual situation.

By balancing contributions and considering your financial strategy across these different account types, you can optimize your overall investment and retirement strategy.
