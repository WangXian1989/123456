Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and contribution limits.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in investments, but subject to capital gains tax and other taxes on earnings.

### 2. Prioritization Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**:
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching; it’s essentially free money.
  
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
  - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing here for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
  - **Traditional IRA**: Use this for tax-deferred growth if you anticipate a lower tax rate at withdrawal.

- **Supplement with Taxable Accounts**:
  - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This provides liquidity and access without penalties before retirement age.

### 3. Investment Strategy
- **Diversification**:
  - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
  
- **Rebalancing**:
  - Regularly review and rebalance your allocation to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions strategically across these accounts can enhance your long-term financial stability. Always consider your specific financial situation and goals when making decisions. Consulting with a financial adviser can also provide personalized recommendations.
