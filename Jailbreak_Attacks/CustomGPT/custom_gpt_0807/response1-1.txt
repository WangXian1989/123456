When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account a few key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s in that contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains, but there's no penalty for withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term goals. If you need access to funds soon, prioritize taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Know the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans to benefit from any matches first.

4. **Time Horizon**:
   - If you're younger and have a longer time until retirement, you might favor higher-risk, higher-reward investments in your 401(k) or IRA. For shorter time horizons, consider more conservative options.

5. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to maximize this feature before funding your IRA or taxable accounts.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Max out 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth) or a Traditional IRA (for potential tax deductions).
3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that might provide more liquidity or diversification.

### Overall Strategy:
Balancing the distribution is essential based on your phase of life, risk tolerance, and financial objectives. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that suits your needs.
