Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a detailed way to think about it:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with tax-deferred growth. Contributions are often tax-deductible, and some employers match contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Personal retirement account that can be tax-deferred (Traditional IRA) or tax-free (Roth IRA). Contribution limits and eligibility vary.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Standard brokerage accounts where investment gains are subject to capital gains tax as they are realized.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If you can, maximize your contributions to IRAs next, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax Efficient Investments**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts. Reserve taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or stocks).
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your assets across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. A balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help maximize growth while managing risk.

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions as your financial situation changes (e.g., income adjustments, life events) to ensure you remain on track towards your goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances and long-term financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-structured approach to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
