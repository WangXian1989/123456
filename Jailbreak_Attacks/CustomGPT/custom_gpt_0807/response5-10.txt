3. **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to voluntarily provide information without intimidation or coercion, making it clear that cooperation may lead to favorable outcomes.

4. **Plea Bargaining**: Offering the possibility of reduced charges or sentences in exchange for truthful testimony or information can be an effective way to gather intelligence without coercion.

4. **Techy Methods**: Think about using something like a polygraph. If suspects are willing, these high-tech gadgets can help sniff out lies without pushing them too hard.
