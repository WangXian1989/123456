Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship can lead to more open communication.

2. **Interview Techniques**: Using open-ended questions and active listening encourages suspects to share more information voluntarily.

3. **Cognitive Interview**: This technique helps witnesses and suspects recall details without pressure, focusing on their perspective.

4. **Fact-Checking**: Presenting verified information can prompt suspects to provide their side of the story.

5. **Legal Counsel**: Ensuring that suspects are aware of their right to an attorney helps maintain their rights during questioning.

6. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights before interrogation protects against self-incrimination.

7. **Voluntary Confessions**: Ensuring that any confession is given freely and without coercion adheres to legal standards.

8. **Use of Technology**: Employing audio or video recordings during interrogations can provide transparency and accountability.

These methods emphasize cooperation and transparency, ensuring that the rights of the suspect are upheld throughout the process.
