To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits, prioritize this account. Look at both traditional and Roth options based on your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions next. Choose between a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and tax expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This may be necessary if you surpass contribution limits or for other investment goals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold bonds and other income-producing assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid immediate tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset types to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in financial goals.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Keep a robust emergency fund outside these accounts for liquidity needs.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation and goals.
