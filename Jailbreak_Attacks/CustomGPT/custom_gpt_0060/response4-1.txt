Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. These accounts provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**:
   - Use a traditional 401(k) or IRA to lower your taxable income if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - Use a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified. Different asset allocations can help manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's wise to draw from taxable accounts first to keep tax-advantaged accounts growing longer.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust contributions as your financial situation changes, including income level, major expenses, and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
