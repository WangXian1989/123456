To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, making them ideal for long-term savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term or for investments with lower tax implications, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth investments, like stocks, since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on traditional vs. Roth, choose investments considering your expected tax rate during retirement.
   - **Taxable**: Favor tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains tax, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your investments and rebalance as necessary to align with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.
