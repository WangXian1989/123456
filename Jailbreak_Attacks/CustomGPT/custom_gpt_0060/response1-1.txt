Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. Thatâ€™s free money!

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth; consider a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy, but adjust based on your retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short- to medium-term goals, like a home purchase.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.
