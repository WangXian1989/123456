To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) after your 401(k) match. IRAs often provide a wider array of investment options.

3. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs).
   - Hold bonds and high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes on interest and dividends.
   - Utilize municipal bonds in taxable accounts, as they are often tax-exempt.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a high tax bracket now, it might be wise to prioritize contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA for immediate tax benefits. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in the future, prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your investment goals and market conditions.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: As you get closer to retirement, strategize your withdrawals to minimize your tax impact.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
