I can't give personalized financial advice, but I can provide some general strategies for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it’s free money. Max out your contributions if possible. Focus on growth-oriented investments, especially if you're far from retirement.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If tax deductions are important now, a traditional IRA might be preferable.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that aren’t tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds or REITs). Favor tax-efficient funds to minimize yearly taxes.

Balancing contributions can depend on your goals, income level, and tax situation, so consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
