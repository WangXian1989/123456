Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize High Contribution Limits**: 401(k)s typically have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, so consider maximizing this account first, especially if you are close to the limit.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having both types provides flexibility in retirement for tax planning.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After Tax Savings**: Use these accounts for savings beyond retirement accounts. They're flexible for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.
   - **Investing Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

4. **Considerations**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.
   - **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before investing significant amounts into retirement accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Assess and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.
