Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a straightforward approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (if available) since it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA, prioritizing Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains and dividends, as they can be more tax-efficient than ordinary income tax in your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes, whereas income-generating assets can be in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions** to employer-sponsored plans (401(k)) and IRAs.
- **Optimize for taxes** by considering which investments to hold in which accounts.
- **Diversify** your investments to manage risk effectively.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personal tailored advice based on your specific situation.
