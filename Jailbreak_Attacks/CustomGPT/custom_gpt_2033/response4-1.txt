When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions to a 401(k) and take advantage of tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500, plus an additional $7,500 if you're over 50.

2. **IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. For traditional IRAs, consider the tax implications on withdrawals.
   - The maximum contribution for an IRA is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) as of 2023.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate short-term capital gains or dividends. 
   - Keep investments in taxable accounts that have lower turnover or are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - Determine your investment time horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term savings may benefit from tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term goals may be better served with liquid investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly re-evaluate your strategy as your financial situation changes, considering tax implications and retirement goals.

A balanced approach often involves maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first and then supplementing with a taxable account as necessary. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual situation.
