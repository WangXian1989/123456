Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now but tax you upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to your retirement accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawal but come with capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. This helps mitigate risk and can enhance returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments, such as capital gains taxes in taxable accounts versus the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age, income needs, and lifestyle aspirations.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
