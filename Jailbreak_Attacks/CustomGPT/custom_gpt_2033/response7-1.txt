The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially "free" money.
   - Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - Use these accounts primarily for long-term growth, as they offer tax advantages on contributions and earnings.

2. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, focus on a diversified portfolio that includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly other assets.
   - For taxable accounts, you might choose investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Reduce Taxable Income**:
   - Try to fill up the lower tax brackets by contributing to tax-deferred accounts first. This can lower your taxable income and savings.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a longer time horizon, you might want to be more aggressive with your 401(k) and IRA investments.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping cash or low-risk investments in your taxable accounts.

5. **Assess Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications when planning for withdrawals. For instance, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Revisiting Your Allocation**:
   - Regularly evaluate your strategy based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, and market performance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances can significantly affect the best approach. Meeting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice for your situation.

By keeping these points in mind and considering your specific financial circumstances, you can develop an effective distribution strategy for your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
