The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, your current tax situation, and your investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Begin by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it offers tax advantages (Traditional or Roth) that align with your financial situation.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket, prioritize Roth accounts where growth and withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversification of Assets:** Allocate investments based on the type of account. For tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding assets that generate ordinary income (like bonds) as dividends or interest are taxed at a higher rate in taxable accounts. Conversely, place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:** As your portfolio grows, periodically reassess and rebalance your investments in all accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs:** Keep an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account separate from these investment vehicles. Consider your short-term financial goals and liquidity needs when deciding how much to allocate to taxable accounts.

6. **Seek Professional Guidance:** Every financial situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By implementing these strategies, you can work towards a balanced approach that leverages the benefits of each account type while aligning with your financial goals.
