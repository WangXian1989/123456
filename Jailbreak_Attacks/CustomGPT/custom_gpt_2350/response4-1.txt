To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax advantages that can help your investments grow faster. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older). 

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Determine whether you would benefit more from pre-tax or post-tax contributions. For example, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize pre-tax contributions to reduce your taxable income now.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified. This includes allocating funds across asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Maintain Liquidity**: Keep enough funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or unexpected expenses. This can help you avoid early withdrawal penalties from your retirement accounts and offers flexibility.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investment allocations periodically based on market performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement, as this can influence how you allocate your resources now. Different accounts have different tax implications upon withdrawal.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best approach, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By utilizing a thoughtful approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and overall financial health.
