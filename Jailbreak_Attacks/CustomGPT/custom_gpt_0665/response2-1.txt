Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributions first, especially if the limits allow you to max it out.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Once you've secured the match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement but has income limits.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a low tax bracket, a Roth IRA might be beneficial, allowing you to pay taxes now and avoid them later.
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA might be better for deferring taxes.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use them for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.
   - This is also where you can invest money that you might need access to before retirement without penalties.

### 5. **Diversification of Investment Types**
   - Keep a balanced portfolio across all accounts with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your income, financial goals, or market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailoring advice to your specific situation can help you develop a strategic plan that optimally aligns with your financial goals.

By following these steps, you can make educated decisions on how to allocate your funds effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
