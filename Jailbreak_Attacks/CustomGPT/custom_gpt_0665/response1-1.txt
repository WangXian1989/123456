Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The Roth IRA has tax-free growth and withdrawals if you're eligible, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute but taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Consider your asset allocation across these accounts to manage risk and returns. You might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and safer investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Financial situations can change, so regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions as necessary. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized plan based on your specific circumstances can be beneficial, especially for maximizing tax efficiency.

Ultimately, the best approach balances immediate tax savings with long-term growth and liquidity needs.
