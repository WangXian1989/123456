Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your income level, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds left over after maxing out 401(k) and IRA contributions can go into taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, though you’ll pay capital gains tax on investment growth.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: If you need liquidity (for a house, travel, etc.), prioritize taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: For retirement, favor tax-deferred or tax-free accounts for long-term growth.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation is well-diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy, adjusting as necessary based on performance and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
