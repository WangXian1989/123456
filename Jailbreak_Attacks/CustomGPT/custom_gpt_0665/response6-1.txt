When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize growth and minimize taxes:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Max out 401(k) contributions:** Take advantage of employer matches and contribute the maximum amount allowed. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible during contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). 

### 2. **Balance Asset Allocation:**
   - **Tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts:** Hold investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains in taxable accounts, as they are usually taxed at lower rates.
   - **Bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts:** Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in your retirement accounts to shield them from higher tax rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:**
   - **Younger investors:** Focus more on growth-oriented investments, especially in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can benefit from compound growth.
   - **Near retirement:** Shift towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA to preserve capital, with some growth components still in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - **Annual assessments:** Review your investment allocation and adjust as necessary based on performance and changes in tax law or your financial situation.
   - **Rebalance portfolios:** Ensure your investment mix remains aligned with your overall strategy and risk tolerance.

By being strategic with your contributions and investment choices, you can effectively manage your money for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
