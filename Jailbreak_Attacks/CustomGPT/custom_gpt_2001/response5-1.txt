Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider funding a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**: After maximizing any employer match and contributing to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The contributions lower your taxable income, and any growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional savings. This can offer more flexibility, as you can access these funds without penalty before retirement age. Taxable accounts can also provide benefits such as capital gains tax treatment, which is generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

5. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**: Depending on your time horizon and risk tolerance, your investment strategy may differ across these accounts. For example, you might choose to hold more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred, and opt for more conservative investments in your taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities from dividends and interest.

6. **Rebalance Appropriately**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure your investment allocation aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal finance can be complex, and seeking professional advice tailored to your individual circumstances can provide personalized strategies.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so it’s important to evaluate your own financial condition and long-term goals before making decisions.
