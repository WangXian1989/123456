The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year but taxes will be due upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Contributions can be either pre-tax (Traditional IRA) or post-tax (Roth IRA). Roth IRAs benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Interest and dividends are also taxed annually.

3. **Diversification of Investments:** Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, not just one. Consider using tax-efficient investment strategies, such as holding bonds in tax-deferred accounts and stocks with high growth potential in taxable accounts.

4. **Set Up Automatic Contributions:** Automating your contributions can help you consistently invest without having to think about it.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Assess your portfolio at least once a year to ensure that your asset allocation and distributions remain aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Before aggressively investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate account for unexpected expenses.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy:** As you approach retirement, consider how you’ll withdraw from each account. Understanding your withdrawal strategy can impact current and future tax liabilities.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice and to consider your unique situation thoroughly, seek guidance from a finance professional.

It’s important to review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation and goals change over time.
