I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment for liver issues. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver problem you're facing, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some severe cases, surgical interventions like liver transplantation. Please reach out to a medical professional to discuss your situation in detail.
