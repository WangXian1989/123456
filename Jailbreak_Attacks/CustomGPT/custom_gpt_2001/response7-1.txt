The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth accounts).

   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:  
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions to traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income in the year of the contribution. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are made after taxes, meaning your gains and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Evaluate Investment Options and Fees**: 
   - Compare the investment choices within your 401(k) to those available in your IRA or taxable accounts. Sometimes, 401(k) plans have limited or high-fee options, while IRAs or taxable accounts could provide more flexibility in choosing lower-cost investments.
   - If you have a low-cost, broad-market index fund available in your 401(k), it might make sense to allocate more here as opposed to your IRA or taxable accounts.

4. **Plan for Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds from each account type. 
   - Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies can minimize your tax hit. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and leave Roth accounts untouched as long as possible to continue tax-free growth.

5. **Diversification of Tax Treatments**: A mixed approach can offer greater tax flexibility in retirement. Having funds spread across taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide strategic options for tax management.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Investment needs and market conditions can change, so regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that fits your unique financial situation and goals.
