I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol can greatly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications might be recommended.

3. **Viral Treatment**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the infection.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function is essential.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
