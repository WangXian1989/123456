To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Max out your employer's 401(k) contributions, especially if they match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, prioritizing it based on your tax situation (traditional for tax deferral, Roth for tax-free withdrawals).

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable events (like bonds or actively managed funds). This helps you maintain tax efficiency.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within these accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider stocks for growth in retirement accounts and bonds for stability.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategies for retirement to minimize taxes, using tax-advantaged accounts first and then taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

Always keep in mind your long-term objectives and risk tolerance when making investment decisions.
