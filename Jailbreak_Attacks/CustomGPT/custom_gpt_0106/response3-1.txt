To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing employer matches and contributing up to the yearly limit. This reduces taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) or strategies that minimize capital gains.

2. **Goal Alignment**:
   - **Retirement Goals**: Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term investments. 
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for accessibility. 

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Invest in growth-oriented assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts while placing income-generating assets (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
