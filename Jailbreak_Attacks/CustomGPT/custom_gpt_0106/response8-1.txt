To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax deductions, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions available for those over 50).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts from interest income.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that yield qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications to minimize your overall tax burden in retirement.

6. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation.
