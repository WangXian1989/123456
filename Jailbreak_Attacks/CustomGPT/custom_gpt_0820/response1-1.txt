I can provide general information about investment and account types, but please note that you should consult with a qualified financial advisor or tax professional for personalized advice.

1. **401(k)**: This is typically your first priority since contributions may be matched by your employer. It also offers tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial for long-term retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: IRAs can provide tax advantages for retirement savings as well, with options such as traditional IRAs (tax-deferred) and Roth IRAs (tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals). Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k), especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are great for investments that you might need access to before retirement. They don't have tax advantages like retirement accounts, but you can take advantage of capital gains taxes and tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### General Strategy:
- **Max out employer match in 401(k)**.
- **Contribute to your IRA** (up to the limit).
- **Invest additional money in your 401(k)** or **taxable accounts** based on your liquidity needs.

Approach your investments with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon in mind. Always consult with a qualified financial advisor for tailored recommendations, especially regarding tax implications and changes in law.
