When developing a strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following points, while keeping in mind that it's important to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice:

1. **Understand Account Characteristics:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth, and many employers provide matching contributions, which can boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Choosing between them depends on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are more flexible in terms of withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Maximize your 401(k) contributions first, especially to take advantage of any employer match.
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings if you've reached contribution limits on tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Allocate tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Hold investments that may incur higher taxes (such as bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio across these accounts to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

Always seek the guidance of a financial professional to tailor a strategy that best fits your unique situation and goals.
