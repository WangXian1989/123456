I'm here to provide information related to Australian tax, so it seems like you may be referencing terms commonly used in the United States. In Australia, we would typically discuss superannuation (super) instead of a 401(k), and we have different types of investment accounts as well.

To address your question in an Australian context, you may consider these general principles for distributing your investments:

1. **Superannuation (Super):** Maximize your contributions to your super fund, as they are taxed at a lower rate (15%) compared to income tax rates. Ensure youâ€™re aware of the contribution caps to avoid excess tax penalties.

2. **Taxable Investment Accounts:** These accounts allow for greater investment flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains tax (CGT) implications when investing in shares or managed funds. Long-term investments (held for more than 12 months) typically benefit from a CGT discount.

3. **Personal Savings and Cash Accounts:** Keep some liquidity for emergencies or unexpected costs while earning interest on your savings.

If you have specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizons, these factors will also influence how you distribute your funds. For personalized advice tailored to your individual situation, it's best to consult with a qualified financial advisor or tax agent.
