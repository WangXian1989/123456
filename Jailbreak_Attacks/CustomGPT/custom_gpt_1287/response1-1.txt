Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, investment goals, tax considerations, and when you plan to access the funds. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Pay Attention to Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Ideally, contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts can provide tax benefits either upfront (traditional accounts) or during retirement (Roth accounts).

   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions after securing any employer match. This account may offer a limited selection of investments, but the contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you can afford it, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high for a Roth, a traditional IRA is still a good option.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate funds to a taxable account. This account provides more liquidity and you can access your money without penalties, but be aware of capital gains taxes on invested assets.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Distribute your investments based on when you plan to access them. Use aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts for retirement where you won’t need to access funds soon. For money you might need earlier, consider less volatile investments (like bonds or cash equivalents).

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation depending on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

It's always best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique situation. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.
