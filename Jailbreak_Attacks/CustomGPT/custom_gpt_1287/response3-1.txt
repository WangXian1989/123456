Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is an important decision that impacts your overall financial strategy and tax situation. Here are some factors to consider when determining the best distribution approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offered by your employer, typically includes tax-deferred growth. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Employers may offer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be either a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Contribution limits and tax benefits vary based on income and account type.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held outside of retirement accounts. There are no tax advantages, but you can access funds without penalties. Capital gains tax applies on profits when sold.

2. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to maximize that match. It's essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income, but you will owe tax upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Offers tax-free withdrawals, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. If you qualify, this can be beneficial for future tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on any profits, but you also have flexibility in withdrawing funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Options**: Check the available investment choices in each account. 401(k) plans can have limited options compared to IRAs or taxable accounts, which may allow for a more diverse investment strategy.

5. **Financial Goals and Time Horizon**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Long-term growth may favor tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term needs could justify more funds in taxable accounts.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $20,500 under age 50 (as of 2022), with catch-up contributions for those over 50.
   - IRA: $6,000 under age 50 (as of 2022), with catch-up contributions for those over 50.
   - Taxable accounts: No limits on contributions.

7. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Regularly assess your asset allocation across these accounts to maintain diversification and align with your investment goals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
2. Max out contributions to an IRA (if eligible) for tax efficiency.
3. Allocate any additional funds to a taxable account for liquidity and diversification.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution among your accounts depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.
