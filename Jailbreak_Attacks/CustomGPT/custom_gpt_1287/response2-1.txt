When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions. Choose based on your current tax bracket and future expectations.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After securing the employer match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions. In 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older). This is especially important if you are in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you've contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, allocate assets among stocks, bonds, and other investments.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your allocations regularly (annually, for instance) and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation. Market fluctuations can change the percentage of your investments in different areas.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be highly beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these steps and tailoring them to your individual circumstances, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize your retirement savings and investment growth.
