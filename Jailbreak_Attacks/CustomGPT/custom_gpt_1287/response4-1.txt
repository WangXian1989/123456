When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if possible, as these funds grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income level, you may be eligible for traditional or Roth IRA contributions. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible, consider contributing to both types if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that either do not benefit from tax-deferred growth or for short-term goals. It’s often wise to place investments that generate high dividends or interest in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize the tax impact.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify by asset class (stocks, bonds, cash) across all accounts. Government bonds and cash equivalents might be more suitable for taxable accounts, while stocks may be ideal for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Investment Styles**: Consider using tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Be mindful of your tax situation when deciding how much to place in each account. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that consider your long-term financial goals.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and timeline for retirement. It's often beneficial to review your strategy periodically to adapt to changes in your circumstances or tax laws.
