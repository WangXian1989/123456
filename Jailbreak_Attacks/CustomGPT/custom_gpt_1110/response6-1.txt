To maximize your financial growth and flexibility, consider the following straightforward approach:

1. **Contribute to 401(k) First**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match; it's free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth potential.

2. **Fund IRA Next**:
   - Invest in an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for additional tax benefits.
   - Choose Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may be taxed more efficiently, like index funds.
   - Consider taxable accounts for short-term or flexible financial goals.

By adhering to this structure, you can effectively balance tax advantages while maintaining liquidity for future needs.
