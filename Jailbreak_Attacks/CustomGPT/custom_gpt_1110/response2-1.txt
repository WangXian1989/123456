Distribute your money based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Generally, follow this approach:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
2. **Fund your IRA**: Prioritize a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA can be beneficial for tax deductions.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for savings beyond your retirement accounts, especially if you need flexibility or anticipate needing the money before retirement. 

Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
