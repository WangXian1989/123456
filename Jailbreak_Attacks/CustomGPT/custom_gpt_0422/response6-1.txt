To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Needs**: Determine how much you need for retirement and when you plan to retire.
   - **Current and Future Tax Bracket**: Estimate your current tax situation versus what it might be in retirement.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically allows for higher contribution limits and may have employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawal but subject to capital gains tax. Useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, or a Traditional IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts**: If you have remaining funds, use these for investments in a taxable account, emphasizing tax-efficient investments.

### 4. **Annual Review**
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals each year.

### 5. **Investment Choices**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, or target-date funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA and Taxable Accounts**: Consider diversified investments, including ETFs or index funds, to minimize taxes on capital gains.

Balancing these accounts allows for tax efficiency and maximizes your investment growth over time, supporting both short-term and long-term financial goals.
