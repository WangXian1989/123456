Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts wisely can lead to better tax efficiency and long-term growth. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, which can provide tax benefits (traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth; Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Tax Year Limits**: For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those over 50). Ensure you stay within these limits.

### 2. **Consider Investment Growth Potential**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term growth without immediate tax implications. Use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns or those that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds).

### 3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Needs**: If youâ€™re closer to retirement, consider a more conservative allocation in your 401(k) and IRA. 
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since they offer more liquidity. Invest with a long-term perspective in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: In taxable accounts, be mindful of capital gains taxes on sold investments. Consider holding assets for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Offset gains in taxable accounts by selling investments that have lost value, thereby reducing your tax burden.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across all account types to mitigate risk. Aim for a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Schedule periodic reviews (annually or semi-annually) to assess your asset allocation. Rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

### Final Thoughts
The best distribution strategy depends on your individual financial situation, goals, tax bracket, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a plan that suits your needs specifically.
