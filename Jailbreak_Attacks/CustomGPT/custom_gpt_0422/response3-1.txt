Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions up to that match; it's essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if you have a high income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - Consider a **Traditional IRA** if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, as contributions may be tax-deductible.
     - Opt for a **Roth IRA** if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when withdrawing funds since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - Contributions to tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and Traditional IRA reduce your taxable income for the current year. 
   - Roth contributions do not reduce your taxable income now but can provide tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing retirement accounts, consider your taxable account for investments that you may need access to before retirement. This account can be used for short-term goals or emergencies.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your investment types based on your comfort with risk. Stocks may be suitable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Periodically review your allocation and make adjustments based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

### Conclusion
Start with contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then allocate funds to an IRA based on your tax considerations, and finally fund a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility. Regularly assessing your strategy will help optimize your investment growth.
