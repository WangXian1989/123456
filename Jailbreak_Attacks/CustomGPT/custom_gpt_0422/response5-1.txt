Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax advantages, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need access to before retirement. They generally have fewer tax advantages, but you can manage capital gains.

### 3. **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Goals:**
   - Keep enough savings in a taxable account for emergencies or plans within the next few years. 

### 4. **Investing Strategies:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments (like stocks) to maximize growth.
   - In taxable accounts, consider lower turnover investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance and Review:**
   - Regularly review your allocation based on market performance and life changes, adjusting contributions as necessary.

### Example Allocation:
- If your total investment budget is $15,000:
  - $6,000 (401(k) to max the employer match)
  - $5,500 (IRA contributions)
  - $3,500 (Taxable account for short-term needs)

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.
