Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored, offering tax-deferred growth. May have limited investment options and possibly employer matching.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts with tax advantages. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible accounts that allow you to withdraw funds anytime but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**

- **Short-Term (0-5 years)**: Consider keeping more in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.
- **Medium to Long-Term (5+ years)**: Maximize tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compound growth.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it's essentially “free money.”
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After IRAs, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: If you still have funds available after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**

- **Diversify your investments**: Across all accounts, include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance.
- **Tax-efficient investments**: Keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**

- Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Planner**

For personalized advice, it's prudent to consult with a financial advisor who can guide you based on your specific financial situation.

### Summary

Start by taking full advantage of your 401(k) employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. Keep in mind your investment strategy and tax efficiencies for long-term growth.
