To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions if possible, as these can provide tax-free growth (Roth IRA) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA).

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're over 50).
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Diversify Investments**: Choose a diverse mix of assets in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks can be suitable for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.

4. **Account Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals at retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, as this allows your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. 

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Evaluate your current and expected future tax rates. It might make sense to use traditional accounts when you expect to be in a lower tax bracket at retirement and use Roth accounts if you anticipate a higher tax bracket.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to ensure you are aligned with your investment strategy and goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure of the best approach for your unique situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a well-balanced portfolio that maximizes your retirement savings while minimizing tax liabilities.
