Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires balancing tax advantages, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions, especially if you qualify for a tax-deductible traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Focus on long-term investments and consider tax-efficient funds to minimize liabilities.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Timeline:** Adjust your investment mix based on your age, goals, and risk tolerance. Younger investors might favor growth-oriented assets (stocks), while those closer to retirement may shift toward safer assets (bonds).
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across various asset classes to minimize risk.

### 4. **Withdrawals Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Consider the implications of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) for traditional accounts after age 72.

### 5. **Periodic Review**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust based on market conditions, your financial situation, and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match.
2. **IRA:** Max out an IRA if eligible.
3. **Taxable Account:** Use any remaining funds after maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions for a taxable account.

### Final Tips
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
- Keep emergency funds in mindâ€”ensure you have enough liquidity outside of investments for unexpected expenses.

By strategically dividing your contributions, you can optimize your savings and investments effectively.
