To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching; contributions may be pre-tax or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA:** Offers tax advantages; contributions can be traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Fully flexible; you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains but have no contribution limits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of employer matching.
   - **Max Out IRA:** If you can, contribute the maximum to your IRAs next—especially if it’s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Focus on higher-growth, higher-risk investments here, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider keeping more stable investments, as you’ll get taxed on dividends and interest. Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) that minimize capital gains distributions.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and alternative investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Consider Your Age and Retirement Timeline:**
   - Younger investors may favor more risky assets for growth, while those closer to retirement may balance with more stable investments to preserve capital.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Plan:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary (enough to get full match)
- **IRA:** Up to $6,500 annually (or $7,500 if over 50, divided as you prefer between traditional and Roth)
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional savings (e.g., emergency funds, short-term goals).
