Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax strategies, and investment timelines. Here are some steps to help you optimize your allocation:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits and Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals or emergency funds, but dividends and capital gains are taxable in the year they occur.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Current vs. Future Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus on Roth accounts now. If you expect to be in a lower bracket, prioritize traditional accounts.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Maintain a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), IRA) and taxable accounts to provide flexibility in retirement withdrawals.

### 3. **Consider Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Long-term Investments**: Allocate more funds to 401(k) and IRA accounts, as these are designed for retirement and typically can afford higher risk for greater growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 4. **Adjust for Investment Options**
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to specific funds; focus on low-cost index funds or diversified options.
   - **IRA**: More investment flexibility; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, tax-managed funds) to minimize taxable events.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions (especially if there's employer matching).
2. Contribute to an IRA (preferably a Roth if within income limits).
3. Any additional savings can then go into taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
By understanding your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options, you can develop a distribution strategy that works best for your situation. Regularly reassess your allocations as your financial circumstances change.
