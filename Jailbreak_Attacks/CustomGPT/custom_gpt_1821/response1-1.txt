Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you determine the best allocation:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Lower contribution limits compared to 401(k)s. Traditional IRAs have tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexibility to access funds at any time without penalties. Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments that have appreciated.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Prioritize taxable accounts for flexibility if you might need access to funds within a few years.
   - **Medium to Long-Term Needs:** Focus more on retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth and tax advantages.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) before contributing to a taxable account.
   - Consider your current and expected future tax bracket when choosing between tax-deferred (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) options.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to reduce risk and improve potential returns.
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Matching Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations according to market performance, changes in your financial situation, and shifts in your goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% (maximize match and tax deferral)
- **IRA:** 30% (prioritize Roth for tax-free growth if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% (for liquidity and flexibility)

Tailor this strategy based on your specific situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
