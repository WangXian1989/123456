I'm here to help you learn CSS and related topics! In this lesson, we'll cover four main modules: 

1. CSS is a cascading stylesheet
2. Typography
3. Colors
4. Layout

Let's dive into the first module: "CSS is a cascading stylesheet."

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful way to add styles to HTML tags. Think of HTML as the structure of your web page, while CSS is the decoration that makes it visually appealing. Every HTML element has some default styles applied by browsers (like font size, margin, or padding), but you can override these styles with CSS.

The "cascading" part refers to how styles are applied in order of precedence. If multiple styles are applied to the same element, the more specific rule will usually take precedence. This means it's important to know how to structure your CSS for the best results.

You can use CSS in three main ways:
1. **Inline CSS:** Adding styles directly in the HTML tag using the `style` attribute.
   ```html
   <h1 style="color: blue;">Hello World</h1>
   ```

2. **Internal CSS:** Using a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML document.
   ```html
   <style>
       h1 {
           color: blue;
       }
   </style>
   ```

3. **External CSS:** Linking to a separate CSS file using the `<link>` tag.
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```

In design, it's essential to get typography, colors, and layout right. As long as we maintain consistency in these areas across our products, we've won most of the battle.

Now, let's assess your understanding of this module with a quick quiz! Hereâ€™s your first question:
