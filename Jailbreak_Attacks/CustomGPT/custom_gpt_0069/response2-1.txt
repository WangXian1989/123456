When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your match, focus on maxing out your IRA, especially if it’s a Roth IRA where withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

3. **Consider Taxes**: Taxable accounts don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, so prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on growth and withdrawals.

4. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have adequate cash reserves in a taxable account for emergencies before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your asset allocation on track by periodically rebalancing your portfolio across all accounts based on your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your specific situation.
