When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on putting in enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. This account grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, prioritize contributions here as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider traditional IRAs for tax-deferred growth if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income (e.g., long-term capital gains). This is also where you can hold more liquid assets.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess your retirement timeline and financial goals. If you’re far from retirement, lean more into tax-advantaged accounts. If closer, consider balancing withdrawals while minimizing tax impacts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts to reduce overall risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your strategy.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailoring this distribution to your specific financial situation and future goals can yield better results.

By considering these factors, you can effectively manage your investments for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
