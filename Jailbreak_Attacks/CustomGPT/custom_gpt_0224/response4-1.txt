Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Good for high earners looking for immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if eligible for a Roth IRA based on income.
   - If you have additional funds, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement, especially for short-term goals or if you need liquidity. Favor investments that are tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

5. **Review Investment Options**: Ensure each account is invested in accordance with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Adjust as Needed**: Regularly review your distribution and make adjustments based on your financial situation, changes in goals, and market conditions.

If you're uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.
