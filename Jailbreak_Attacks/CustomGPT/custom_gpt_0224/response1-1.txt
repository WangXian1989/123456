Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Consider contributing up to the maximum if you can.
   - **IRA**: A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for investments meant for shorter-term goals, as you will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Location**: Consider which types of investments belong in which accounts:
   - Place high-growth or high-tax investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Keep lower-growth or tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts if needed.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for future withdrawals. Taxable accounts are more flexible without penalties, while 401(k)s and IRAs have age restrictions.
