Managing the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax efficiency and investment growth. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an extra catch-up contribution for those over 50).
   - Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may be better.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little to no income (like stocks held long-term), as they can benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Hold investments that are expected to yield high returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Keep bonds and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of your lower tax bracket.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, and life events.
