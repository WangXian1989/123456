Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. 
   - **IRA** (traditional or Roth): IRAs offer tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth for traditional IRAs or tax-free withdrawals in retirement for Roth IRAs.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - If youâ€™re close to retirement, prioritize 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions for tax benefits.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like index funds or ETFs) and for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Expense Ratios**: Pay attention to the fees associated with different accounts. Choose low-cost investment options to maximize returns.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation annually based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

### Suggested Order of Priority:
1. 401(k) up to the employer match
2. IRA contributions, focusing on Roth or traditional based on your tax situation
3. Additional contributions to 401(k)
4. Taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investments
