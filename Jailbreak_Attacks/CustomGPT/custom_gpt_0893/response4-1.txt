Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Choose the type that fits your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Prioritize maxing these contributions if you qualify.
   - **401(k)**: If you haven’t hit the max contribution or want to save more, continue contributing here after the IRA.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you’ve contributed to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using a taxable account for additional savings. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals and may have favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Investment Options**
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments. Mix stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized guidance, consider talking to a financial advisor. They can help tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances.

### Example Allocations
- **Aggressive Growth**: 70% in 401(k) and IRA (with a focus on stocks), 30% in taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Balanced**: 50% in tax-advantaged accounts, 50% in taxable for both growth and liquidity.

### Conclusion
Your distribution strategy should reflect your individual goals and situation. Regularly re-evaluating your approach ensures you stay aligned with your financial objectives.
