Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching, which is free money. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible with investments and withdrawals but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify; otherwise, use a traditional IRA for tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for any additional savings, especially if you've maxed out retirement accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax Deferral:** Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) during higher income years.
   - **Tax-Free Withdrawals:** A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance:**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments within tax-advantaged accounts since they wonâ€™t be subject to capital gains taxes during growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments to minimize tax impacts.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Think about your withdrawal strategy, as tax implications will vary by account type. Have a plan for which accounts you'll draw from first in retirement.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Check your allocations annually or after major life changes, adjusting based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income + employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out your contributions ($6,500 annually; $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate any remaining savings.

This strategy should align with your overall financial plan and goals. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
