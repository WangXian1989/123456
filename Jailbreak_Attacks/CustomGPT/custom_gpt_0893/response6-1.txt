Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher short-term capital gains, as you're taxed on these annually. Investments like stocks that you intend to hold long-term can be more tax-efficient in retirement accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Make sure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversify among stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Up to the match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
- **IRA**: Depending on limits, contribute the maximum allowable amount (e.g., $6,500 for those under 50 in 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds can be placed here, focusing on tax-efficient funds or investments.

### Review and Adjust Regularly
   - Keep an eye on your portfolio allocations and adjust as necessary, especially as you approach retirement.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
