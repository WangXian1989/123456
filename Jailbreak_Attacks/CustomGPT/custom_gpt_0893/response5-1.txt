Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a basic approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if they offer a matching contribution. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to kickstart your retirement savings. 

2. **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction upfront but taxes you on withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or after-maxing out retirement accounts. These accounts give you more flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties. However, be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### Example Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k)**: Try to contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Aim for the maximum allowed annually ($6,500 in a traditional/Roth IRA for under 50 in 2023).
- **Taxable account investing**: Use additional funds for investments that can be sold without penalties, prioritizing tax-efficient funds (like index funds).

### Additional Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- **Retirement Timeline**: Balance the long-term growth of tax-advantaged accounts with the liquidity of taxable accounts if your goal is shorter-term.

### Conclusion:
Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this approach further to your specific needs.
