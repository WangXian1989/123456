I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver issues. Generally, treatment for liver problems can vary depending on the specific condition, but common options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol can help manage liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease, specific medications might be prescribed to address underlying causes, such as corticosteroids for autoimmune conditions or antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver resection or even transplantation may be considered.

5. **Supportive Care**: Addressing symptoms and managing complications through supportive therapies can be essential.

Always discuss your symptoms and treatment options with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
