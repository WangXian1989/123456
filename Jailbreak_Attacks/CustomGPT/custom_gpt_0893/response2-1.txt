Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially “free money” and a great first step.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Type:** Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you’re aware of the contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, plus $1,000 catch-up if you’re over 50).

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you still have room in your budget after maxing out your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Purpose:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement age or for goals like buying a home or funding education.
   - **Utilize Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on index funds, ETFs, or municipal bonds in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts first. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, Roth accounts might be more beneficial.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 20-30% (max contributions)
- **IRA:** 10-15% (max contributions)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20-30% (after meeting retirement contributions)
- **Emergency Fund:** Keep 3-6 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account.

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Time Horizon:** Younger investors can take more risks, while those closer to retirement may prioritize conservative investments.
- **Investment Options:** Choose a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
A well-rounded approach balances contributions across these accounts while considering taxes, investment goals, and time horizons. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
