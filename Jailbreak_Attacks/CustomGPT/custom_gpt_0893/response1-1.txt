Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRAs**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, this can be a good option, as contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA accounts before investing in taxable accounts, as these offer more significant tax advantages for long-term growth.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be withdrawn anytime without penalties, making these suitable for short-term goals or emergencies. Consider holding investments with lower turnover (like index funds) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Balancing Investments**: 
   - Growth assets (like stocks) are generally better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where you can benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider placing fixed-income investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since interest from these can be taxed at a higher rate.

### Example Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to get the full employer match in your 401(k).
2. Max out your Roth IRA (if eligible).
3. Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. Invest any leftover funds in a taxable account with a focus on tax-efficient investments.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Bracket**: Your current and future tax brackets will greatly influence which accounts are more advantageous.
- **Withdrawal Plans**: Think about your retirement withdrawal strategy and how it aligns with your accounts.
- **Diversification and Risk**: Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
