Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
- **Investment Options**: Choose investments with lower fees and a diversified mix.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: The limit is $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if you're 50+).
- **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Funds can be accessed anytime without penalties, which is great for short-term needs.
- **Capital Gains Taxes**: Be mindful of tax implications on dividends, interest, and capital gains.
- **Investment Time Horizon**: Use taxable accounts for investments you plan to hold for longer periods to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### **Distribution Strategy**
1. **Max Out the Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After the 401(k) match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
3. **Return to 401(k)**: Once your IRA contributions are maxed out, contribute additional funds to your 401(k), up to the limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any surplus funds after maxing out retirement accounts can go into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### **Final Considerations**
- **Adjust According to Tax Bracket**: Depending on your current and expected future tax brackets, you might prefer pre-tax (Traditional) vs. post-tax (Roth) contributions.
- **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.
