Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to guide you:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Age**: When do you plan to retire? 
   - **Income Needs**: What income will you need in retirement?
   - **Risk Tolerance**: How comfortable are you with investment risk?

### 2. **Account Types Overview**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Consider maxing this out to take advantage of any match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility to withdraw without penalties; however, capital gains taxes apply.

### 3. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals (like a home purchase) or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Aim to invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable gains.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Focus on tax-advantaged accounts early in your career when you're likely in a lower tax bracket. 
   - As income rises, weigh the benefits of Roth contributions for tax-free growth against immediate tax deductions.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Review your asset allocation annually and adjust contributions based on performance and changing goals.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

This can vary significantly based on your specific circumstances, so adjust the percentages as necessary to align with your goals and risk tolerance.
