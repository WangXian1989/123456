Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available). This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA provides a tax deduction.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If youâ€™ve maxed out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level as markets fluctuate.

### Example Contribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out to at least the employer match (e.g., 5-10% of salary).
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings after maxing out the above accounts.

### Final Considerations
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can align your strategy with your specific financial situation and goals.
- **Long-Term Perspective**: Stick with a long-term investment strategy to ride out market fluctuations.

By balancing your investments across these accounts, you can work towards a more secure financial future while optimizing for tax efficiency.
