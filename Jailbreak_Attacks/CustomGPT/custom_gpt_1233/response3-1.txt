Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach to guide you:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Determine whether your goals are short-term (buying a home, vacation) or long-term (retirement, education). This will influence how you allocate funds.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax-deferred growth. Often includes employer matches.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Individual retirement accounts offering tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Accounts where you pay taxes on gains and dividends in the year they are realized. They offer more flexibility, but less tax efficiency.

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out traditional or Roth IRA contributions next, based on your taxable income and access to workplace retirement plans.

### 4. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider moving excess funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio to mitigate risk, involving stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.
   - **Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on performance, changes in goals, and economic conditions. Rebalance as necessary.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the intricacies of tax laws and personal financial situations, a financial advisor can tailor a strategy suited to your needs.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your income (up to the match limit)
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: $6,500/year (or $7,500 if over 50 for 2024)
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your funds and work towards achieving your financial goals.
