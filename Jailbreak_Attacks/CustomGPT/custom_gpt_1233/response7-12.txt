I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information on liver health. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options for liver issues often depend on the specific condition and severity but may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Reducing fats, sugars, and alcohol while increasing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Physical activity can help improve liver function.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight can significantly benefit those with fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**: Prescribed based on the underlying liver condition (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Supplements**: Some people use milk thistle or other herbal supplements, but discuss these with your doctor first.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Essential for almost all liver conditions.

5. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: Regular liver function tests to monitor the condition.

6. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant might be considered.

Make sure to discuss your symptoms and condition thoroughly with a healthcare provider for the best treatment plan tailored to your needs.
