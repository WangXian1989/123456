To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs can provide a tax deduction.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement or for holding investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Medium- to Long-Term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth due to their tax benefits.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments like stocks or mutual funds, as taxes are deferred or minimized.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more conservative investments, like bonds or dividend-paying stocks, to take advantage of favorable tax rates on long-term gains.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This will help manage risk and improve long-term returns.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions until you hit the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds here, aiming for a balanced approach that considers your time horizon and liquidity needs.

### Conclusion
To maximize growth and tax efficiency, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, while using taxable accounts for flexibility. Regularly reassess your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
