Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket now.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide based on your current and expected future tax brackets. A traditional IRA may benefit you now if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. A Roth IRA, funded with after-tax dollars, allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you're aware of the maximum contributions allowed (e.g., $6,500 for IRAs; $7,500 if you're 50 or older as of 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, though they don't have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### **Distribution Strategy:**
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Start with the 401(k) up to the employer match, then max out IRA contributions, and finally invest in a taxable account if you have additional funds.
- **Balance Risk and Return:** Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider diversifying between stocks, bonds, and other assets.
- **Reassess Regularly:** Review your allocations at least annually and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and goals.

### **Example Allocation:**
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** 30%
- **Taxable Account:** 20%
