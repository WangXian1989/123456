Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution limit ($22,500 for 2023; $30,000 if age 50 or older).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After the 401(k), contribute to an IRA. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Taxable Account:**
   - Invest in taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This account is flexible, allowing for withdrawals without penalties, but will be subject to capital gains tax.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Younger individuals can typically afford to take more risks in equities within these accounts. As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering that tax-advantaged accounts can hold higher-risk investments. Taxable accounts may benefit from holdings that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for favorable tax treatment.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation based on changing goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs, tax situation, and retirement goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively allocate your money and optimize your investment strategy.
