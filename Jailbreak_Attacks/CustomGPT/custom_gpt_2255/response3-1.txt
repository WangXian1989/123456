Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fully Fund an IRA**:
   - After the employer match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. These often offer tax advantages that can benefit you long-term.

3. **Contribute More to 401(k)**:
   - If you still have room in your budget, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Assess Taxable Accounts**:
   - Allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts if you have short-term goals or need liquidity. These can also be beneficial for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - When withdrawing from these accounts in retirement, understand the tax implications. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs are tax-free if certain conditions are met.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial needs.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
