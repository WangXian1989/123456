The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your employer match, consider how much you want to contribute to your 401(k). Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income for the year, whereas Roth 401(k) contributions do not but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **IRA Contributions:** If you qualify, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions (depending on income), while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. For many, a Roth IRA can be more beneficial, especially if you expect your income to increase in the future.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This is particularly useful for short-term goals, as it allows for more flexibility in accessing your money without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Regardless of account type, ensure that your investments are diversified and align with your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. This may involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of the tax implications of each account. For taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, that generate lower capital gains.

7. **Review Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change, so review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly to ensure it remains aligned with your objectives.
