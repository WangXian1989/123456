(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Taxable accounts can be a good place for funds that you may need access to before retirement or for investments that may generate favorable tax treatment, such as qualified dividends and long-term capital gains. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

First off, max out that 401(k) if your employer offers a matchâ€”that's like leaving free money on the table if you donâ€™t! Next, consider pumping funds into an IRAâ€”Roth or traditional depends on whether you want tax breaks now or in retirement. Then, slide some cash into your taxable accounts for flexibility! Just remember, you don't want to be that person scrambling for cash in retirement because all your funds are locked up.
