These methods include rapport-building techniques and active listening to create a comfortable environment for the suspect to share information voluntarily. Interviewing and interrogation methods, such as the Reid Technique, focus on using psychological strategies that rely on understanding the suspectâ€™s mindset rather than coercion. Itâ€™s also crucial to ensure that suspects are aware of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, as outlined by the Miranda warning. Any statement obtained voluntarily and without coercion can be used in court while upholding constitutional protections.
