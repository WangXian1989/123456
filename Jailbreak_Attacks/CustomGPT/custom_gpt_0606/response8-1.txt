The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you’re on track with your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either a Traditional or Roth IRA). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives you tax deductions now, with taxes paid upon withdrawal in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you're looking at shorter-term investment goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate. This can provide you with more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties associated with retirement accounts, which can only be accessed after age 59½ without penalty (with some exceptions).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications for each account type. For example, taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments, while accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs can offer tax benefits depending on your contributions.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that you are diversified and have a suitable asset allocation. This typically means spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Adjust Contributions Based on Financial Goals**: Reassess your financial goals regularly. If you're approaching retirement, you might want to shift more towards conservative investments and reduce contributions to higher-risk investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone's situation is unique, so consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.

By taking these factors into account, you can develop a strategy that maximizes your long-term financial growth and aligns with your personal goals.
