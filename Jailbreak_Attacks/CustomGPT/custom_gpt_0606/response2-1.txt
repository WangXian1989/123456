When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and an excellent first step.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA after maximizing the employer match. IRAs often provide more investment choices than 401(k) plans. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it a favorable option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year they are made, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility without the contribution limits and penalties associated with retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts with a longer time horizon (like a 401(k) and IRA) since you won't need to access these funds for years. Use more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts if you need liquidity.

6. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, you can sell investments at a loss to offset gains, which can help reduce your overall tax burden.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements or changes in your financial situation.

The right distribution ultimately depends on your unique circumstances, financial goals, and preferences. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
