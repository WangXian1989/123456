I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment approaches for liver issues. Here are a few options that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: Avoid alcohol to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and health.

4. **Supplements**:
   - Some may benefit from liver-supporting supplements, but consult with a healthcare provider before starting any.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment options.
