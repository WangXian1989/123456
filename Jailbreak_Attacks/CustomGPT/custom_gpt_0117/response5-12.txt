I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options that you might discuss with a healthcare professional.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or improve liver function.

3. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: For issues like hepatitis or fatty liver disease, treating the underlying condition is crucial.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgery might be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be the best option.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.
