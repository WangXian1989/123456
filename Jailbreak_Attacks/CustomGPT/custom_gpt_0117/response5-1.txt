Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is effectively “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax advantages.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, stick to a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, focusing on long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy but consider factors like tax implications (Roth IRAs grow tax-free).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments. Focus on tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax burden.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Utilize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments to defer taxes.
   - Keep less tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize immediate tax consequences.

4. **Regular Review**:
   - Assess asset performance and rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain your desired allocation.
