Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (typically a priority).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to either a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax upon sale, making it prudent for holding short-term investments.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize taxes.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you might need funds before retirement, maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes regardless of account type.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals or tax laws.
