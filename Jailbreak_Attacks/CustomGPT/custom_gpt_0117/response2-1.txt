To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.
   - **401(k)**: After maxing out the employer match, aim to max out your contributions to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:  
   - Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement and for investments you may need access to before retirement age. 
   - Consider using taxable accounts for assets that generate lower capital gains (like index funds) to reduce your tax burden.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Stocks may be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds and cash equivalents can go into taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - Take into account your current and expected future tax bracket to decide between Traditional and Roth accounts. Fund accounts based on where youâ€™ll benefit the most tax-wise.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Example Allocation:
- If you're under 50:
  - 401(k): $19,500 (max contribution)
  - IRA: $6,000 (max contribution)
  - Taxable: Any excess savings or investment income.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation and goals.
