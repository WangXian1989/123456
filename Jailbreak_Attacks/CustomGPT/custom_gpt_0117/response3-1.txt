Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable investments for short-term goals or if you need flexibility. Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Investing Strategy:** Ensure your investments are allocated based on your risk tolerance:
     - Stocks for growth (typically in tax-advantaged accounts),
     - Bonds for stability (may consider keeping some in taxable for tax efficiency).

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Periodic Reassessment**
   - Revisit your strategy regularly based on changes in tax laws, income, and financial goals.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to tailor this distribution strategy to your specific needs and goals.
