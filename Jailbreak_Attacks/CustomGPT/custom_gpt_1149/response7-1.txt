Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach, considering factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility with investments (stocks, bonds, funds) and donâ€™t have contribution limits. However, capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments at a profit.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to optimize any employer matching. This is essentially free money.
- **Consider Tax Advantage**: If your income allows, max out contributions to an IRA, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. Match Your Investments to Your Goals
- **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on equities in retirement accounts to maximize long-term growth potential where capital gains are less of a concern due to tax advantages.
- **Shorter-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to sooner (smaller projects, emergencies).

### 4. Asset Allocation Strategy
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Consider a diversified mix of equities, fixed income, and cash.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, hold tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and more tax-efficient investments (like indexed funds or stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 5. Rebalance and Review
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals, risk appetite, and market conditions.

### Summary
Start with employer-sponsored 401(k) contributions to take advantage of matching, then consider IRAs for tax benefits, and finally allocate any additional funds strategically in taxable accounts. Always keep in mind your overall financial goals, time horizon, and market conditions.
