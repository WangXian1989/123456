Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max it out if you can (for 2024, the limit is $23,000 plus an additional $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (annual limits for 2024 are $6,500, plus $1,000 catch-up for those 50+). Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate significant taxable income (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) or if you’re nearing retirement and need flexible access to funds. Consider tax-efficient investment types here.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash. Generally, you can afford to take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts since withdrawals are taxed later.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

### 5. **Consider Future Withdrawals**
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailored advice from a professional can help optimize your strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals.

Ultimately, the best approach will vary based on your situation, so it’s essential to personalize these strategies.
