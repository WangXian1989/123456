Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Maximize Matches:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider this if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. In contrast, traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits each year, and prioritize maxing out these accounts if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts have fewer restrictions on withdrawals, making them useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations:** Consider the tax implications of selling investments in these accounts. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

### 4. **General Tips:**
   - **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before making significant investments.
   - **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice based on your financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investments while considering tax implications.
