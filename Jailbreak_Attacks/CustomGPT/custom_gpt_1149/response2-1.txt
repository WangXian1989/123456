Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Invest Wisely:** Choose a diversified mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider target-date funds for simplicity.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Current Tax Situation:** If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax-deferred growth. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). Prioritize this if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** These accounts allow for withdrawals without penalties and provide liquidity for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient cash for emergencies (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. 
- **Rebalance Periodically:** Review and adjust your allocations periodically, especially after significant market movements.

### Example Distribution
- **Aggressive:** 70% in 401(k) and IRA, 30% in taxable accounts.
- **Moderate:** 50% in 401(k) and IRA, 50% in taxable accounts.
- **Conservative:** 30% in 401(k) and IRA, 70% in taxable accounts.
