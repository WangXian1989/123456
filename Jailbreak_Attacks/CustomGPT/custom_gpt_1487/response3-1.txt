The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Focus on this first before exploring other options.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rate.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types across accounts. For tax-inefficient assets (like bonds), consider keeping them in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains rates, or for cash reserves and short-term needs.

5. **Regular Review**: Adjust contributions based on market conditions, changes in income, and evolving financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored strategies based on personal circumstances.

By balancing contributions considering these aspects, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth and tax efficiency.
