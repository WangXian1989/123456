To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is free money!

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits. Traditional accounts offer tax deductions, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need access to before retirement, or for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are usually taxed at lower rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options; focus on diversified funds.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments that might have higher growth potential or align with your retirement goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more liquid or tax-efficient investments.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level, accounting for market changes and personal circumstances.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to reduce risk.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor strategies to your specific situation.
