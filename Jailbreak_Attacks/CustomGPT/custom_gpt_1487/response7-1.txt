It's wise to think strategically about your investments. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. Prioritize this for tax-deferred growth.
   
2. **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Otherwise, traditional IRAs can also be beneficial for tax savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible access to funds. Consider investing in taxable-friendly assets (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Considerations**:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your comfort level with risk.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer timelines can handle more volatility; shorter timelines may need more stable investments.
- **Tax Implications**: Analyze the tax impact of withdrawals and potential penalties.
