I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional about liver issues. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Diet modifications (low-fat, high-fiber).
   - Avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**:
   - Prescription drugs to manage symptoms or underlying conditions.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be discussed. 

Always seek personalized advice from a medical expert.
