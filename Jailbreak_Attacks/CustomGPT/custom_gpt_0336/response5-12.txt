I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
