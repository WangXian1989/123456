Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

4. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for tax-deferred growth and potential employer contributions. Consider contributing to a traditional 401(k) for its current tax benefits or a Roth 401(k) if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax). The Roth option offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across accounts, considering tax implications of withdrawals. Typically, you might want to hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more income-generating assets in taxable accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your investment strategy and distributions annually, adjusting as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
