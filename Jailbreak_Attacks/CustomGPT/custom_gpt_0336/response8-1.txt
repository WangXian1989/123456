Distributing your money wisely across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, focusing on pre-tax contributions to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deductions, based on your income level.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional investments after maximizing retirement accounts. Here, focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. For example, keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable ones (like bonds) in taxable accounts, to minimize tax impact.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, or life events.
