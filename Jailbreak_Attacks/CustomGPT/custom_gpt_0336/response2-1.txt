Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Consider maxing this out if your employer provides a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Choose based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth if you meet income limits. A Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a good mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for your withdrawal strategy in retirement. It often makes sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy further based on your specific circumstances.
