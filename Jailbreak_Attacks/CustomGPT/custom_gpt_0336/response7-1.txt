Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These provide liquidity and flexibility, though you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, and place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Time Horizon**: For long-term goals, higher-risk assets can be advantageous in tax-advantaged accounts due to the compounding benefits without immediate tax implications. 

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Review your allocations yearly and adjust as needed based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
