To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're not already maxing out contributions (currently $22,500 or $30,000 if you're over 50), prioritize this for pre-tax growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatments, like long-term capital gains or municipal bonds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate). Generally, high-growth assets should go in tax-advantaged accounts (to maximize compounding) while more stable investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Keep in mind the tax implications of future withdrawals. For example, withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts and long-term capital gains in taxable accounts may have lower tax rates.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
