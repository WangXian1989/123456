The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first. Contribute as much as you can, especially if your employer offers a match, since it's essentially free money. 

2. **IRA**: Consider both traditional and Roth IRAs. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial. For immediate tax benefits, a traditional IRA is a solid choice.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may have lower tax burdens, like index funds or municipal bonds. This is also useful for short-term goals or when you need liquidity.

**General Guidelines**:
- Prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages.
- Adjust based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

It may be helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
