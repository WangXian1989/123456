To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This maximizes free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and future tax expectations.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments (like stocks) due to tax deferment.
   - Keep more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from preferential tax treatment.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider asset allocation that reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your target asset allocation across all accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a low-risk savings or money market account, separate from your investment accounts.

By strategically allocating funds, you can optimize growth potential and tax efficiency.
