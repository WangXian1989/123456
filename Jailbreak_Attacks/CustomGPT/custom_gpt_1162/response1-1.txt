When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your tax situation, investment goals, and when you plan to access the funds. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with a matching contribution, you should prioritize funding this account up to the match limit. This is essentially free money. Consider contributing enough to maximize any employer match before investing in IRAs or taxable accounts.

2. **IRA Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, you might want to contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals. Choose based on your current tax bracket and expectations for retirement. If you're eligible, Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These don’t have the tax advantages that retirement accounts offer, but they provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments. This could be useful if you may need money before retirement age or want to invest in assets that are not suitable for retirement accounts (e.g., real estate, certain stocks).

4. **Considerations**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses.
   - **Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off.
   - **Investment Horizon**: Your age and how soon you need access to the funds will influence your allocation.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given that everyone's situation is different, consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized insight that aligns with your specific financial goals.

By strategically allocating your funds across these accounts, you can optimize your savings for both short- and long-term financial health.
