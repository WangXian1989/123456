Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider factors like tax efficiency, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, contribute the maximum limit.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and flexibility, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - Hold bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket, Roth contributions can be beneficial.
   - In higher brackets, traditional accounts might offer immediate tax deductions.

### 4. **Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you’re nearing retirement, shift towards less volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For younger investors, consider growth-oriented assets in taxable accounts for potential lower capital gains.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance and changing financial situations.

Tailor your strategy to your specific financial goals and consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
