Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match first.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Aim to contribute at least the maximum allowable amount if financially feasible.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: 
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Best if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals. Best if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount to benefit from tax advantages.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for Flexibility**: Invest in a taxable account for funds you may need before retirement, as this provides flexibility in access.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
1. **Prioritize**: Contribute to your 401(k) first to get the employer match, then fund your IRA, followed by taxable accounts.
2. **Adjust Based on Tax Implications**: Monitor tax brackets and adjust contributions to maximize tax efficiency.
3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diverse asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
Your specific distribution may depend on individual circumstances, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
