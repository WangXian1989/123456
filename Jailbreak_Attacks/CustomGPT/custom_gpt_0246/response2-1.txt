Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts efficiently can optimize your retirement savings and minimize taxes. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.
   - Aim to max out annual contributions if possible.

### 3. **Tax-Efficient Investing in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate extra funds here.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket now, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket later, focus on Traditional accounts for immediate tax benefits.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your allocations annually to adjust for changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or investment performance.

### Summary
Start with your 401(k) for the match, maximize your IRA contributions, and then focus on taxable accounts. Keep tax implications in mind for overall financial planning.
