Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors to optimize your investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a concise strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
  
### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement or for short-term goals.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Higher Growth Investments (Stocks):** Place these in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Bonds or Income-Generating Assets:** Consider holding these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Consider Future Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Bracket:** Manage distributions to avoid jumping to a higher tax bracket.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for retirement withdrawals to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Review your allocations regularly as your life circumstances and market conditions change.

By focusing on tax efficiency and flexibility, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively.
