To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax preferences.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Withdrawals are taxed for traditional accounts.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k) benefits but may have contribution limits based on income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed annually, so consider placing more volatile investments here to benefit from long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**
   - Longer timelines can tolerate more volatility in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter horizons may favor more stable investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Use each account type for different investments to balance risk and return effectively.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep your allocations aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. Periodic rebalancing helps maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 20-30%
- **IRA**: 20-30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40-60% (depending on your liquidity needs)

### Conclusion
Tailor your contributions based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
