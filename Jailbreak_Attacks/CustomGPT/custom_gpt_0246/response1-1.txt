Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money!). Aim to maximize your contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; withdrawals are taxed. Ideal for those in a lower tax bracket now than expected in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Choose based on your current vs. future tax expectations.
   - **Taxable Account**: Use this for more liquid investments and for purposes that don't benefit from tax deferral. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - Short-term goals (buying a house, emergency fund): Favor taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Long-term goals (retirement): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use each account type to hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. For hyper-growth, consider equities in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage taxes.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Life changes, tax laws, and market conditions can impact your optimal allocation. Review your investments at least annually.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 15% of your salary
- **IRA**: Max out contribution limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable**: Any surplus after 401(k) and IRA contributions

### Summary
Start with employer matches, leverage tax advantages, and diversify effectively. A financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
