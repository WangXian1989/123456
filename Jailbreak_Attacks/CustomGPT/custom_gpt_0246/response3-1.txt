Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you have additional funds, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **High Tax Bracket:** Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to minimize taxable income now.
   - **Low Tax Bracket:** You may benefit from contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free income in retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Generally suited for long-term growth. Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

### 5. **Regular Re-evaluation**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on changing income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 15-20% of salary until you hit the employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds here.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your unique situation, considering contributions, investment options, and potential tax impacts. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
