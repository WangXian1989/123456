I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options for liver issues often depend on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can significantly benefit liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Keep follow-up appointments and tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can also help.

Always seek medical advice for a personalized treatment plan.
