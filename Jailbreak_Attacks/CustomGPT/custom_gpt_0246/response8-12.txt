I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general suggestions for liver health. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can support liver health.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help the liver function properly.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoid Alcohol**:
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly benefit liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function and health.

5. **Manage Underlying Conditions**:
   - Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol should be managed effectively.

6. **Supplements**:
   - Consult a doctor before taking any supplements that claim to support liver health.

It's vital to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation from a healthcare provider.
