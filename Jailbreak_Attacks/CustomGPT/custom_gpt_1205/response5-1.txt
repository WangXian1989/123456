(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is pre-tax money that grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** Contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rate when choosing between them.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investing after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes, and consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

Balancing these accounts can lead to tax efficiency and better growth potential over time.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! If you wanna get the most bang for your buck with your money spread over a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's a plan:

1. **401(k):** First off, if your employer's throwing in free money with a match, you've gotta max that out. It's like leaving cash on the table if you don't. Stuff it full of pre-tax dollars, and watch it grow without Uncle Sam sticking his hand in your pocketâ€”until you take it out, of course.

2. **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Next, think about whether you want to pay taxes now or later. If you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, go for a Roth IRA. Want tax deductions today? A Traditional IRA is your buddy. Aim to max those bad boys out!

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After you've squeezed every drop from those tax-advantaged accounts, bring your investment game to taxable accounts. Here, you can choose investments that won't hit your wallet too hard with capital gainsâ€”like low-cost index funds. Just remember, this money's gonna be a bit more exposed to taxes, so balance it out!

Mixing up those accounts wisely can save you some serious cash down the line!
