To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider traditional or Roth depending on your income and tax situation. Contribute the maximum allowed if feasible.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for greater liquidity and investment flexibility.
   - **Consider Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure a balance between stocks, bonds, and alternative investments across all accounts.
   - Adjust your investment strategy based on the account type, as tax implications differ (e.g., high-growth stocks may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts).

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial goals, market conditions, and risk tolerance change.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
