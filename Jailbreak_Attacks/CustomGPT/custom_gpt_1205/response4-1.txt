To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider this for immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth). Balance contributions based on your current tax situation and expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for savings that you may want to access before retirement without penalties. However, youâ€™ll pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - For longer-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - For medium-term goals (buying a home, etc.), you might allocate more to taxable accounts to maintain flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, taking into account their tax implications.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type and adjust your contributions accordingly.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across these accounts as your financial situation and goals evolve.

By following these steps and considering your unique financial situation, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your investments.
