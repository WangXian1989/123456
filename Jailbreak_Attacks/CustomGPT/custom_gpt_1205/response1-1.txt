Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional) after maximizing your 401(k). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Understand the Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax upon selling. Use taxable accounts for investments that you plan to hold long-term, minimizing frequent trading. This is also useful for funds you might need within the next few years.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For medium-term goals, a mix of taxable accounts and retirement accounts may be appropriate.

4. **Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance:**
   - Adjust the asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and the purpose of each account.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Continuous Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure, consider seeking personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will vary from person to person, so consider your individual needs and circumstances when making these decisions.
