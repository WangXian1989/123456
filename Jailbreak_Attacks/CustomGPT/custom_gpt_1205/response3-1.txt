Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions may lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Similar tax benefits as 401(k) but with different rules. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if there’s a match.
   - Follow up with IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your preference and eligibility).
   - Any extra savings can go into taxable accounts.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **For Traditional accounts**: You’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement, likely when you might be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **For Roth accounts**: Withdrawals are tax-free, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts have ongoing tax implications (dividends, interest, and capital gains).

### 4. **Evaluate Investment Options**
   - Align investments based on account type. More aggressive investments can go into tax-deferred accounts, whereas more stable or income-generating investments might fit better in taxable accounts to manage taxes efficiently.

### 5. **Estimate Your Retirement Needs**
   - Consider how much you’ll need in retirement. This can guide how much to allocate to tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for when and how you will withdraw from each account. This helps in managing taxes effectively during retirement.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially to capture the employer match.
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if you’re under the income limits, otherwise consider a Traditional IRA based on your income.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you’ve completed contributions to the above accounts.

### 7. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically review your allocations as your income, expenses, and financial goals change.

This strategy sets a foundation, but consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
