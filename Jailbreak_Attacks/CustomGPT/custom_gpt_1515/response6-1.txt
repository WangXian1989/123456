The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowable if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

### 2. **Balance Contributions When Necessary**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or additional investments after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - Diversifying your investment strategy in taxable accounts can also provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Investment Strategies**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term, growth-oriented investments since these accounts are designed for retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals. Adjust contributions accordingly to optimize your tax situation and investment growth.

By balancing contributions effectively across these accounts, you can enhance your long-term financial growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
