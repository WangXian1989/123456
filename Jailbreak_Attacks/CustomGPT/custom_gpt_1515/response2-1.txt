Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match (if available). This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (after-tax), depending on your income and tax bracket. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs. This minimizes capital gains taxes.
   - For high-yield investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks), consider keeping them in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re saving for retirement, focus on growth-oriented investments in your retirement accounts. 
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping more liquid and conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance. Stocks typically go into tax-advantaged accounts for growth, while bonds may be better in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - As markets fluctuate, your asset allocation can shift. Periodically review and adjust your investments to stay aligned with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can take into account your entire financial picture.

Ultimately, the best strategy aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
