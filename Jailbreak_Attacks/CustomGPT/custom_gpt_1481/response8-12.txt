I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, exercise, avoiding alcohol, and medications specific to the underlying cause of the liver problem. In some cases, more advanced treatments like therapy or surgical options may be recommended. Always seek personalized advice from a medical expert.
