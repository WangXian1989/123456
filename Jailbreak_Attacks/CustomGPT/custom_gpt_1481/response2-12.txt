I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options available for liver problems, such as:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can greatly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the type of liver problem (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Nutritional Support**: Working with a dietitian to ensure a balanced diet that supports liver health.

5. **Procedures**: In more severe cases, procedures such as a liver biopsy or, in cases of liver failure, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
