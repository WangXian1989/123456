The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, income level, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Max out your contributions if you can, as contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA can offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Keep in mind the income limits for tax-deductible contributions to IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially beneficial for short-term goals or if you want more flexibility with withdrawals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Favor long-term investments to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments that align with your risk tolerance.

5. **Balance and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in your life circumstances, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice that fits your situation, consulting with a financial advisor can be beneficial. They can help you create a strategy that takes all your financial factors into account.

Consider your overall financial situation, goals, and retirement plans when deciding how to allocate your money among these accounts.
