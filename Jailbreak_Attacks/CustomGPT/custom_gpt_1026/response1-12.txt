I'm not a healthcare professional, but common treatment options for liver problems can vary based on the specific condition. It's important to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. General options may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in severe cases, surgery or transplantation. Focus on a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can also be beneficial. Always seek advice from a qualified healthcare provider for the best course of action.
