(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally speaking, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Maximize your contributions over time, especially if you have a high income.
  
2. **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA might be advantageous for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments beyond retirement accounts and for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income, like bonds or active mutual funds.

Consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice that considers your financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals is also a good idea.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s get real about distributing your cash! Hereâ€™s the no-nonsense breakdown:

1. **401(k)**: First off, throw your money where your employer will match it. Free money, hello? Then, crank up those contributions as you canâ€”especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Max that bad boy out if you can!

2. **IRA**: Go for a Roth IRA if you anticipate making bank in the future; tax-free withdrawals in retirement? Yes, please! If your tax situation is tricky, a traditional IRA might be your jamâ€”just keep in mind you'll deal with taxes later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: For anything extra, think about taxable accounts. These are good for liquidity in case you need quick cashâ€”just be mindful of the taxes on your gains. Keep your high-yield investments here to dodge those nasty tax bites as much as possible.

Bottom line? Diversify and think long-term. And seriously, if youâ€™re feeling overwhelmed, grab a financial advisor who knows their stuff to help steer the ship!
