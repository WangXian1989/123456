The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. After that, consider contributing the maximum allowable limit if it fits within your budget.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you can, contribute the maximum to your IRA after your 401(k). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any remaining funds to taxable investment accounts. This might be suitable for short- to medium-term goals due to greater flexibility in accessing your money without penalties.

3. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Different accounts may have different investment options. Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and invest accordingly, keeping in mind that the tax implications of each account may influence your investment choices.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs. Place higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals, changing tax laws, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also be beneficial for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
