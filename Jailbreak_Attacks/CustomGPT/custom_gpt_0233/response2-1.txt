Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money. Consider maxing it out if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they’re taxed at a lower rate than regular income. This is also a good place for short-term investments.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Keep stocks in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, as they can appreciate significantly. Place bonds in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impacts on income.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - If saving for retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth and tax efficiency.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset distribution based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your salary up to the match limit.
- **IRA**: Max out your contribution (currently $6,500 annually, $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Contribute after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts based on available funds and investment goals.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy based on your unique situation and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
