Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various personal factors like your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income. Roth contributions are post-tax, leading to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Similar options exist with Traditional and Roth IRAs. If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth.

### 3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months' expenses) and manage any high-interest debt before aggressive investing.

### 4. **Prioritize Accounts**
   - Start with tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for contributions.
   - Fill taxable accounts with investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and age.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust allocations periodically to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your income to get the full match.
- **IRA:** Max contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any residual funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
