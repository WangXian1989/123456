I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage the symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver health and prevent complications.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical interventions may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be the only option.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options specific to your situation.
