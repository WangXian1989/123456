Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts wisely can optimize your retirement savings and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match to take full advantage of this benefit.
   - **IRA Accounts**: If your income allows, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that provide flexibility and for funds needed before retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets here to minimize taxes due to capital gains treatment.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Withdraw contributions tax-free anytime. For growth, it's best to leave that until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these funds first if you're accessing money before retirement to avoid penalties.
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Reserve these for later withdrawals, ideally after age 59Â½ to avoid penalties.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax Bracket Management**: Plan withdrawals to stay within lower tax brackets, especially in retirement.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of long-term vs. short-term capital gains taxes on taxable investments.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and goals, adjusting contributions and investments as needed, particularly if there's a change in income or financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies suited to your unique situation.
