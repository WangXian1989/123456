Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions, especially if there's an employer match (this is essentially "free money").
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions now, taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, aim for a Roth. If not, a Traditional IRA might be better.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Great for short-term goals (buying a house, etc.) and for accessible funds without penalties.
   - **Taxation**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; holding investments for over a year can reduce tax rates.

### **Allocation Strategy**
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before putting money into taxable accounts.
3. **Balance**: Keep a mix that aligns with your risk tolerance. Generally, consider shifting towards bonds as you near retirement age.

### **Regular Review**
- Reassess your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- Tailored advice based on your specific situation can significantly help.
