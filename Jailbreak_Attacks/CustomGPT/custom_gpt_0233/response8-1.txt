Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider the Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax benefits now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. They are less efficient for long-term growth compared to retirement accounts.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you need funds sooner, taxable accounts may provide more flexibility.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Income Level**
   - If your income fluctuates, adjust contributions to maximize tax advantages during lower-income years.

### 6. **Review Annually**
   - Reassess the allocation each year based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Up to employer match
- **IRA**: Max out contributions based on eligibility
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds, especially after retirement accounts are fully funded.
