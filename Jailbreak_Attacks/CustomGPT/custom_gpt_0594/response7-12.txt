I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information that might help you start a conversation with your healthcare provider. Treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition and its severity. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Medication:** Depending on your liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or slow the progression of the disease. For instance, antivirals are used for viral hepatitis, while corticosteroids might be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy lifestyle can greatly impact liver health. This includes maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and losing weight if necessary.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Your doctor may recommend routine tests to monitor your liver function and assess the progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery or Procedures:** In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat liver problems. This could include procedures to remove liver tumors or treat complications from cirrhosis.

5. **Liver Transplant:** For severe liver disease, a liver transplant might be the best option. Candidates are usually assessed based on the underlying cause of liver damage, overall health, and other factors.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to understand the best course of treatment for your specific situation. 

Take care!
