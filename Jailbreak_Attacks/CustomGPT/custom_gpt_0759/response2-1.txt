Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you're contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can provide a significant boost to your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may allow you to deduct contributions from your taxable income, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals and managing investment strategies without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Investment Types**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds or high-dividend stocks), while holding investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts for more tax-efficient growth.

5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**: Apart from the above accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in place, typically three to six months’ worth of expenses, before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your life circumstances (like job changes, major purchases, etc.) and be ready to adjust.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy based on your individual circumstances, consulting a financial advisor could provide insights tailored to your unique situation.

Remember, individual financial situations vary greatly, so this outline should be adapted based on your specific needs and goals.
