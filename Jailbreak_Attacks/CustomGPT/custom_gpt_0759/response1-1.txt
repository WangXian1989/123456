Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Then, consider how much to contribute based on your overall savings goals and investment options within the plan.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs can offer tax advantages. With a Traditional IRA, you may be able to deduct contributions from your taxable income, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your expected income during retirement, one may be more beneficial than the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can provide liquidity and flexibility. If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, prioritize contributions here after contributing enough to your 401(k) for the match and maxing out any IRAs you can. Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize tax impact.

**Suggested Distribution Strategy**:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions (considering whether you want a Traditional or Roth IRA).
- Allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts if you can.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your unique circumstances. Additionally, consider reviewing your distribution regularly to adjust to changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
