Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial strategy. Here are some tips to help you with this distribution:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth. 
   - Take full advantage of any employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk and enhance growth potential.
   - Utilize your taxable accounts for investments that generate less tax liability, such as long-term capital gains from stocks you plan to hold for over a year or tax-efficient index funds.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If youâ€™re far from retirement, focus on growth investments in your 401(k) and IRAs. If you're nearing retirement, consider shifting some assets to more conservative investments.
   - Evaluate your liquidity needs; keep a portion of your assets in taxable accounts for easy access if needed.

4. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly assess the performance of your accounts and asset allocation. Rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across different types of accounts, leading to improved long-term financial security.
