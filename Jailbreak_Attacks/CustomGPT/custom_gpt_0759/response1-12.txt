I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition you have. Possible options might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or more severe interventions such as procedures or surgery in certain cases. Always prioritize professional medical advice!
