When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate a few key factors: your financial goals, time horizon, and tax implications. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings. Typically, 401(k) contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, which can lower your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed during withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (taxed upfront, tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Each has its advantages depending on your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, taxable accounts can be a useful vehicle for savings. Although you won't receive tax benefits like those in retirement accounts, you have flexibility in accessing your funds. Additionally, long-term capital gains tax rates are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your investment strategy for each account type. Generally, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs) due to the tax benefits, while holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investment allocations regularly to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, helping you to navigate the complexities of tax implications and investment choices.

It’s important to reevaluate your strategy periodically, especially as laws, markets, and personal situations change.
