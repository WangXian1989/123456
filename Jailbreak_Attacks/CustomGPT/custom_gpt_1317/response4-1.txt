Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions (up to the annual limit) if your employer offers matching contributions. Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income, while Roth contributions do not.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (consider income limits for Roth contributions).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable account for more flexibility and liquidity. This is useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, adjusting your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications for withdrawals from each account type. Taxable accounts can have capital gains taxes, while withdrawing from traditional retirement accounts incurs ordinary income tax.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

Consider consulting with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
