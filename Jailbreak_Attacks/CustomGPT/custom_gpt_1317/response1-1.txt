Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages depending on your income level.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options; beneficial for long-term growth due to tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments with higher potential returns or risk to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. Consider tax-efficient funds.

4. **Account Type Considerations**:
   - **High Growth Assets**: Place in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Bonds and Interest Income**: Consider placing in taxable accounts to avoid high taxation in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Reassess and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market performance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Always consider your overall financial strategy when distributing your funds!
