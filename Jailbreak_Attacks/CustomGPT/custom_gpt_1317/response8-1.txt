When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Contribute the maximum limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether to contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Maintain a mix of pre-tax (401(k), traditional IRA) and after-tax (Roth IRA, taxable) accounts. This gives you flexibility in retirement to manage your tax obligations.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid funds in a savings account or other easily accessible means for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Tailor your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts due to their growth potential.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts, to optimally manage taxes.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocations across accounts to align with your investment goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized guidance based on your financial situation and retirement goals.

Adjust contributions based on income changes, retirement timing, and market conditions to stay aligned with your goals.
