Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get that full match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, if eligible. Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions but taxable upon withdrawal.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - **Bonds and Income Generating Assets**: These can be better suited for taxable accounts, as qualified dividends and long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Bracket Consideration**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus more on Roth accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how to withdraw funds tax-efficiently in retirement, balancing withdrawals from taxable and tax-deferred accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**
   - Ensure part of your funds remains liquid in taxable accounts for emergencies or unexpected expenses.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can help tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Contribution Order**: Max out employer match in 401(k) → Contribute to IRA → Max out 401(k) → Invest in taxable accounts.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.

Adjust this strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
