Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if there’s a match. This lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or interest, as they may be taxed at a lower rate than regular income.
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in an accessible account before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to manage risk.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: Younger investors may prioritize growth in taxable accounts, while those nearing retirement might shift toward income-generating investments.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your specific situation.
