The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which helps reduce your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also typically tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether you have a workplace retirement plan. Withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer the flexibility of withdrawing funds without penalty but come with capital gains taxes on profits. This is a good place for investments you might need liquidity for in the short-term.

3. **Debt Management**: Before aggressively funding retirement accounts, consider paying off high-interest debt, as the interest could outweigh potential investment gains.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Depending on how far you are from retirement, spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each type of account to align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider how you'll withdraw from these accounts in a tax-efficient manner. Having a strategy for withdrawals can significantly impact your tax liability during retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's beneficial to work with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your entire financial picture, ensuring tax efficiency and investment growth.

In summary, start by maximizing any matches in your 401(k), explore tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs, and balance your investments based on your financial goals and time frame. 

Always remember to continually reassess your strategy as your financial situation and tax laws change.
