Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Depending on your investment goals and risk tolerance, allocate your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across these accounts to ensure a balanced portfolio.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** As time goes on and markets fluctuate, regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation.

6. **Consider Time Horizon:** If you have a longer time until retirement, you might consider a more aggressive investment strategy in your 401(k) and IRA. As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Think ahead about how you will withdraw money in retirement. Withdrawals from taxable accounts can be more flexible, while withdrawals from IRA/401(k) will be subject to RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions) starting at age 72.

It's advisable to speak with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
