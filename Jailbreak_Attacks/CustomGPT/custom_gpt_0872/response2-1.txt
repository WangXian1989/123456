To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. Tax is paid on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k) with pre-tax contributions and tax on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and taxes are owed on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

3. **Prioritize Investment Options and Fees:**
   - If your 401(k) has high fees or limited investment options, you might want to prioritize funding your IRA or taxable accounts where you can access a broader array of investment choices.

4. **Consider Your Investment Horizon:**
   - If you're in the early stages of your career, you can afford to take more risks in taxable accounts. For retirement accounts, focus on diversified investments that match your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Balance Contributions Appropriately:**
   - Make sure you balance contributions based on your financial goals. If you find yourself in a high tax bracket now but expect to be in a lower bracket upon retirement, emphasize traditional accounts. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, prioritize Roth accounts.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly:**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and contribution levels based on changes in income, expenses, or life events. Adjust your distribution plan accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - To create a personalized strategy based on your unique financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can provide tailored advice on optimizing your contributions across different account types.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced investment strategy that maximizes tax efficiency and supports your long-term financial goals.
