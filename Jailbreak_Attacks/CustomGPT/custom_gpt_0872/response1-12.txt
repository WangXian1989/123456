I'm not a doctor, but if you're having liver issues, it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition you have. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms, or in some cases, procedures like surgery. Always prioritize getting the advice of a qualified health professional!
