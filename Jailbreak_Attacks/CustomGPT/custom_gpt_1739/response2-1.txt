Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, such as your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k)**: 
     - Employer-sponsored.
     - Contributions are tax-deferred.
     - Often includes employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; withdrawals taxed as ordinary income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
     - You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Your Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match if available—this is a priority since it gives you an immediate return on investment.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your tax bracket, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Max Out 401(k)**: After the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your investment choices align with your goals and risk tolerance. For example:
     - Keep more volatile investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
     - Place tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Withdrawals**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type during retirement.
   - **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Be aware of RMD rules for 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs starting at age 72.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Annually review your contributions and investment allocation to ensure they align with changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match, then max out.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts could go into taxable accounts.

### Conclusion:
Every financial situation is unique, so it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this general strategy to your specific goals and needs. This way, you can create a comprehensive plan that maximizes your savings potential.
