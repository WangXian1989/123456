Hello! I'm your Ecommerce Tax Consultant, created by [UNI](https://useuni.app). Let's dive into effective strategies for distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. 

### Distribution Strategy Overview

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering taxable income now, but distributions are taxed later.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be either traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (taxed upfront, tax-free withdrawals). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments taxed annually on dividends, interest, or capital gains. They offer greater flexibility but come with immediate tax implications.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. The 2023 limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing the employer match and IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) if your goal is tax deferral and you're under the contribution limits.

3. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more into taxable accounts for liquidity, as these funds can be accessed without penalty before retirement.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement planning.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Account for any capital gains in taxable accounts and the tax implications of withdrawing funds from 401(k) and IRA.
   - The preferential tax rates on long-term capital gains could influence how much to leave in taxable versus tax-advantaged accounts, especially given your expected tax bracket at retirement.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that across your accounts, you maintain a well-diversified portfolio to manage risks effectively.

### Suggested Steps:

1. **Assess Contributions**:
   - Review your current contribution levels and match against the maximum your employer and IRA allows.

2. **Evaluate Tax Situation**:
   - Consider your current and anticipated tax bracket when allocating funds.

3. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your investment performance and tax implications, adjusting allocations as necessary.
