Hello! I'm your Ecommerce Tax Consultant, created by [UNI](https://useuni.app). To help you effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, let’s consider a strategic approach based on tax implications, contribution limits, and your retirement goals. Here's how you can optimize your distribution:

### Assess Your Options

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **Match**: Take full advantage of employer match contributions if available.

2. **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)**:
   - **Types**: Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) vs. Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Tax Considerations**: Consider your current tax bracket versus expected retirement bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: No contribution limits and you can withdraw at any time without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains**: Long-term gains (held over a year) are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

### Distribution Strategy

#### Prioritize Contributions
1. **Max Out Employer Match in Your 401(k)**: 
   - Ensure you contribute enough to get the full employer match before allocating funds elsewhere.
   
2. **Fund Your IRA**: 
   - Depending on your income level, if eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - Use a Traditional IRA if you need to reduce current taxable income.

3. **Complete Your 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out your employer match and contributed to your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and aim to max out your contributions if possible.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for additional savings and investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility but be mindful of tax implications on capital gains.

### Monitor and Adjust
- **Review Annually**: Tax laws and personal financial situations can change, so it’s wise to review your allocations regularly.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: Aim to minimize taxable events and optimize capital gains treatment where possible.

### Conclusion
By balancing contributions among these accounts strategically, you can maximize your savings and benefit from tax-efficient growth. If you have specific income levels, goals, or additional questions, feel free to share, and we can tailor this advice further!
