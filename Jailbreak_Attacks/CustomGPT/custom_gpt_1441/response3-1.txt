Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your overall investment strategy and tax efficiency. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions but taxes are due upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them ideal for younger investors.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here after your 401(k) and IRA; you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings, but they offer flexibility for non-retirement goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) should generally be held in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs).
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like stocks) can be held in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

5. **Consider Future Tax Rates**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) for their tax-free withdrawals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies, separate from your investment accounts.

7. **Personal Goals**: Tailor your distribution based on your individual financial goals, timelines, and risk tolerance.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
