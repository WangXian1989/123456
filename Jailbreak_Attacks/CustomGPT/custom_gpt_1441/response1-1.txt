Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially “free money.” Max out contributions if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. If you're focusing on tax deductions, a traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need in the short term or for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. They can also help with liquidity for new opportunities or expenses.

### Suggested Order of Operations

1. **401(k)** (up to the match)
2. **IRA** (max out if eligible)
3. **401(k)** (max out if possible)
4. **Taxable Accounts** (for additional savings)

### Additional Considerations

- **Investment Strategy**: Match your investments to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are spread across asset classes.
- **Tax Impact**: Pay attention to the tax implications of withdrawals and capital gains.
