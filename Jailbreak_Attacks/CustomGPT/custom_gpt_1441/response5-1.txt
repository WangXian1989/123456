(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A common approach is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you're eligible for a traditional IRA, it can provide immediate tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings. This is where you can invest flexibly, but youâ€™ll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

Diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

After that, hit up an IRA; if you're cool with your income being taxed now and not later, a Roth IRA is a sweet deal. 

Your taxable account? Itâ€™s like the playground where you can go wildâ€”just remember, Uncle Sam is waiting to collect on your gains when you sell. Balance your investments across accounts to dodge that tax whirlpool like a pro surfer. The key is maximizing tax advantages while keeping enough flexibility to adapt as your financial game changes!
