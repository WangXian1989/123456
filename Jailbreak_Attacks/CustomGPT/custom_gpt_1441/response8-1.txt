The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money!). Then consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they can be more tax-efficient. Keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance. This could mean holding more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts for better long-term growth, while keeping safer investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocation periodically based on performance and changes in your goals.

5. **Time Horizon**: Allocate more funds into stock-heavy investments if youâ€™re several years away from needing the money, adjusting towards safer assets as you near your goal.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Understand the withdrawal rules for each account. Typically, taxable accounts are tapped first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

This approach balances growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
