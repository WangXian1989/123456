To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts often have tax advantages. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 (and an additional $7,500 catch-up for those 50 and older) for 401(k)s, and $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up) for IRAs.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but check if you qualify for tax deductions based on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts have no tax advantages, but you can control when to realize gains and losses for tax purposes.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) to defer taxes.
   - Hold more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, which might generate interest income taxed at a higher rate.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts, balancing risk and return according to your financial goals and timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Minimize taxes by withdrawing from accounts in a tax-efficient manner.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By combining these strategies, you can optimize your investments and tax situation, setting yourself up for a secure financial future.
