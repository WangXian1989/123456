Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if there’s a match. Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement accounts or for investment flexibility. They can hold investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts, considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your risk preference or financial goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from these accounts, especially in retirement, to optimize tax efficiency.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Always keep an emergency fund separate from these investments to cover unexpected expenses.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your situation.
