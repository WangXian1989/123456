Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - After contributing to IRAs, continue to fund your 401(k) up to your preferred limit.

### 3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement or for goals in a shorter time frame. Investments in these accounts can provide flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Across all accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Keep in mind that bonds and interest-earning assets may be more tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Income Levels**
   - If you expect your income to change significantly, adjust your contributions to maximize tax advantages. For instance, if you’re in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and rebalance as necessary to align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
It’s beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, ensuring a balanced and efficient approach to managing your investments across these different account types.
