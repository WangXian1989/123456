Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, growth potential, and liquidity. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing it out if you can afford to do so.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on whether you prefer upfront tax benefits or tax-free withdrawals later.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, it may be beneficial to prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts could be more advantageous.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your retirement accounts for long-term investments in stocks, which can offer growth over time.
   - Allocate safer assets or fixed-income investments in taxable accounts to manage liquidity and minimize taxes on interest income.

4. **Save for Near-Term Goals in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Keep funds for near-term goals in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties. This could include an emergency fund or saving for a major purchase.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure they align with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Be Mindful of Withdrawals**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account, especially early withdrawals from retirement accounts, which often incur penalties.
