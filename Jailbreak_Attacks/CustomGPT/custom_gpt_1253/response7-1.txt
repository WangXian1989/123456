To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages. The choice depends on your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating extra funds into a taxable investment account for more flexibility. These funds can be accessed without penalties, but watch out for capital gains taxes on investments.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of the types of investments you hold in each account. For instance, place tax-inefficient investments (such as bonds and real estate investments) in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) and keep more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you're maintaining a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
