I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common treatment approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or address underlying causes (like antiviral medications for hepatitis) may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring of liver function can help track any changes in your condition.

4. **Supplements**: Some vitamins and supplements (like vitamin E for fatty liver) may be recommended, but it's essential to talk to a doctor before starting any new supplement.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases or where there is significant damage, surgical options such as a liver transplant might be considered.

Please consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
