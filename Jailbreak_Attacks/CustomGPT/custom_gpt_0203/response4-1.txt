To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred growth, often with matching contributions.
   - **IRA:** Individual retirement account, also tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments taxed on capital gains and dividends, offering more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - Allocate less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and when you plan to access the funds.
   - Younger individuals may favor stocks in retirement accounts for growth, transitioning to more conservative investments as retirement approaches.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account type to spread risk.
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across equities, fixed income, and other asset classes.

### 6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target asset mix based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Maximize employer match, then contribute up to the annual limit if feasible.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount, ideally a Roth if under income limits.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use remaining funds for investments, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### Final Thoughts:
Tailor your strategy based on personal financial goals, current income levels, and anticipated future needs. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
