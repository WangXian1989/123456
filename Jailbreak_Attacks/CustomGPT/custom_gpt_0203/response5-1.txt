Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth), reducing your taxable income now or providing tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k); choose between traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free distributions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you can access your funds anytime without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term versus long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs (emergencies, major purchases) and retirement accounts for long-term savings.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns that generate less taxable income (like bonds).

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. Maximize these if possible to take full advantage of employer matches and tax deductions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement, considering tax implications. Pulling from taxable accounts first might help manage tax brackets.

A balanced approach might include maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, using taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. Tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.

### Summary:
1. Max out tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k), IRA).
2. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and flexibility.
3. Allocate investments based on tax efficiency and growth potential.
