Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high income, consider contributing to a traditional 401(k) for tax deferral. Alternatively, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth 401(k) could be beneficial.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Otherwise, a traditional IRA is good for current tax deductions.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Assess Investment Types**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid yearly taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for bond investments or other income-generating assets, as they can be taxed less favorably in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary, considering your goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to employer match)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts

This approach balances short-term liquidity needs with long-term growth and tax efficiency. Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor strategies to your specific situation.
