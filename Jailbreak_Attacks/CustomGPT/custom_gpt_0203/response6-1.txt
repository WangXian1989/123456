Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (often a 50% match up to a certain percentage).
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement. These can offer both income and capital gains, but be mindful of tax implications.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - High-income years may favor tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) to lower taxable income.
   - In lower-income years, a Roth IRA may be beneficial to lock in lower tax rates.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Higher-risk investments for long-term growth.
   - **IRA:** Diversified investments based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** More conservative, liquid investments to maintain flexibility.

### Summary:
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions** to employer match.
2. **Fully fund IRA** for tax benefits.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** for future flexibility.

By employing this strategy, you can achieve a more balanced and effective approach to your investments.
