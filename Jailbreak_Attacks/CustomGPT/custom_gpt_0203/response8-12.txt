I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on potential treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoid alcohol to reduce further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**:
   - Treat conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or hepatitis that may affect liver health.

5. **In severe cases**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: For advanced liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and tailored treatment plan.
