Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Great for high earners looking to reduce current tax burdens.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also offers pre-tax contributions, but income limits may apply for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on gains annually, but they offer flexibility and no withdrawal penalties.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - For retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), focus on a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance, as these funds will grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - For taxable accounts, consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts. This provides financial security and prevents premature withdrawals from retirement accounts, which can incur penalties.

5. **Regularly Reassess**: As your financial situation changes (e.g., income changes, market conditions), regularly reassess your distribution strategy to align with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Balancing these considerations can help optimize your financial growth while managing risk and tax liabilities effectively.
