Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Contributing to the Max**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Focus on diversified investment options, often available through target-date funds or low-cost index funds.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxable.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and income thresholds.
   - **Long-term Growth**: Consider using IRAs for investments expected to grow significantly, especially if tax-free withdrawals are important.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be used for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds.
   - **Investment Choices**: Diversify with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account before investing.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before allocating funds to taxable accounts.
- **Adjust Based on Goals**: Allocate funds based on your timeline (short-term vs. long-term), tax situation, and retirement strategy.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### **Conclusion**
A well-thought-out strategy will depend on your individual circumstances. It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
