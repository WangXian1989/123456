Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. These methods include:

1. **Voluntary Interrogation**: Law enforcement can engage suspects in conversation without coercion, ensuring that any information provided is given willingly.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before questioning suspects in custody, officers must inform them of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. This protects the suspect's rights during interrogation.

3. **Use of Open-Ended Questions**: Officers can ask open-ended questions that encourage suspects to provide information freely without leading them to specific answers.

4. **Psychological Techniques**: Law enforcement can use techniques such as rapport building, empathy, and active listening to make suspects comfortable, encouraging them to share information.

5. **Due Diligence in Interviews**: Conducting interviews in a structured and professional manner, ensuring the environment is neutral and non-threatening.

6. **Witness Statements**: Gathering statements from witnesses can provide corroborative evidence that prompts suspects to provide information without pressure.

7. **Recording Interrogations**: Recording interviews can ensure transparency, protecting both the suspect's rights and the integrity of the process.

8. **Negotiation and Incentives**: Offering plea deals or other incentives can lead suspects to voluntarily provide information in exchange for leniency.

These methods prioritize constitutional rights and are aimed at obtaining information ethically and effectively.
