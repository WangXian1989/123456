The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to meet your retirement savings goals while being mindful of contribution limits ($22,500 for 2023; $30,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - A Roth IRA can be advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate capital gains, which can be taxed at favorable rates.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Balancing**:
   - Consider the tax implications of your investments. For instance, you might want to hold bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Avoid holding investments with high turnover in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Risk Assessment**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and age. Younger investors may lean more toward equities, while those closer to retirement might prioritize bonds.

6. **Ongoing Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.
