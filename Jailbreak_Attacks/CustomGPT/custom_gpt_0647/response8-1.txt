Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often includes employer matching contributions and has higher contribution limits but may have limited investment options.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages, helps with retirement savings, and provides more investment options than many 401(k) plans.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible regarding withdrawals, but you may owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if availableâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your IRA after your 401(k) contributions, especially if you can deduct contributions based on your income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, particularly if you want more liquidity or have already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Both 401(k)s and IRAs grow tax-deferred, so prioritize these for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Investment Strategies**: In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investment strategies, like investing in index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize tax liability.

4. **Allocate Based on Goals**:
   - **Short vs. Long Term**: If saving for short-term goals, consider using taxable accounts. For long-term retirement savings, prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust investments according to the risk profile in each account based on time until you withdraw the money.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations based on performance and changes in your personal circumstances (retirement age, expected income, etc.).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture and help you optimize your investment strategy.

By carefully considering these factors and adjusting your allocations as needed, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your retirement savings and minimizes your tax burden over time.
