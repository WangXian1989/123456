Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions:
- **Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Max out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) match, especially if you qualify for tax deductions with a Traditional IRA.

### 2. Tax Considerations:
- **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
- **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, as withdrawals are tax-free.
- **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for investing money you might need before retirement since they don’t have early withdrawal penalties.

### 3. Investment Strategy:
- **Higher Risk Tolerance:** If you can handle volatility, consider more aggressive investments like stocks in taxable accounts for long-term growth.
- **Stable Investments:** Use taxable accounts for lower-risk investments to minimize tax implications on interest and dividends.

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy:
- Plan which accounts to withdraw from first during retirement based on tax implications. Generally, it’s smart to withdraw from taxable accounts first before touching tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly:
- Make sure you adjust your asset allocation across all accounts periodically to maintain your intended investment strategy.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach that considers both the tax advantages of retirement accounts and the flexibility of taxable accounts is usually the best strategy. Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation. 

Always assess your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall financial goals before making any decisions.
