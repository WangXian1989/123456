The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have not yet maxed out your 401(k) contributions and you are eligible for tax deferral, this should be a priority. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). Choose a Traditional IRA if you want to lower your taxable income now, or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place investments expected to generate higher returns (and potentially higher taxes) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Keep investments that produce lower returns or are tax-efficient (such as municipal bonds or certain index funds) in your taxable account.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate, accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of where you place your funds, ensure that your overall investment portfolio is diversified to protect against market volatility.

6. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties, although you will owe taxes on any gains.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Tailor your investment strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline (short-term vs. long-term).

8. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to remain aligned with your investment objectives.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also highly recommended to create a strategy tailored to your specific situation.
