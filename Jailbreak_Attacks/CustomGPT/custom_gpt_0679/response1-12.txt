I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for your liver problem. They can provide you with personalized advice based on your specific condition and medical history. Some general approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medication, or other interventions, but only a doctor can give you the right guidance. Please take care of yourself!
