When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize tax efficiency and investment growth:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs first. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth and potential tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), with tax-deductible contributions and taxable withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider funding this if you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these accounts for flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in these accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on the account type:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for the long-term benefits of tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments or assets that generate qualified dividends.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

In summary, start with employer matches, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, be mindful of tax implications, and regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals.
