I'm not a medical professional, but generally, liver treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver problem, whether it's fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or another condition. Here are some commonly recommended approaches:

1. **Dietary Changes**: A well-balanced diet low in fats, sugars, and salt can help reduce liver strain. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and antioxidants are beneficial.

2. **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.

3. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications may include antivirals for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease, or other targeted therapies.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: If alcohol is contributing to liver issues, abstaining from it is crucial for recovery.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring of liver function tests help manage your condition effectively.

6. **Potential Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to identify the best treatment plan for your specific situation.
