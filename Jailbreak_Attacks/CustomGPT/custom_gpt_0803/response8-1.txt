Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive that full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth), affecting your tax situation upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold for a profit; dividends are also taxed annually.

3. **Retirement Goals**: If you're closer to retirement, consider shifting more funds into accounts that provide more liquidity or tax advantages during retirement years. Conversely, if you're younger and investing for long-term growth, you might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth investments that can be tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth accounts).
   - Keep more conservative investments or those that generate regular income in taxable accounts, as they will be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Remember, it’s essential to tailor your approach based on your unique circumstances and consult tax professionals when necessary to make the best decision for your long-term financial health.
