The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k). Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Options**:
   - If you have a traditional 401(k) or IRA, your contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement. Conversely, Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth account might be more beneficial.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Withdrawals from taxable accounts are generally subject to capital gains taxes. Keeping investments that generate capital gains and dividends in tax-advantaged accounts can help minimize your tax burden over time.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio within each account. You can choose a mix of stocks, bonds, ETFs, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Depending on your age and withdrawal strategy, prioritize where to take money from first. It may be wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home) and regularly reassess these goals to ensure your investment distribution remains appropriate.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Especially if you have a significant amount of money to invest, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.

Everyone's financial situation is different, so take these steps as a starting point and adjust according to your individual needs and circumstances.
