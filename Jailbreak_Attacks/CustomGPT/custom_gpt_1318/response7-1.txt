It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively distribute your money among your retirement and investment accounts. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: This is often the best place to start because many employers offer matching contributions. Try to contribute enough to get the full match if possible. If your 401(k) has good investment options and low fees, you may want to prioritize it for its tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Depending on whether you choose Traditional or Roth IRA, this can be a good vehicle for tax-advantaged growth. If your income allows, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A Roth IRA can be especially valuable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility since there are no contribution limits, and you can access your funds without penalties (though taxes on capital gains may apply).

A common approach is to:

- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- After funding your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and time horizon. It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
