It's generally advisable to develop a strategy that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here are some considerations that can guide you:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Maximize employer match contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider your investment options in the 401(k). Often, these accounts offer a range of mutual funds, target-date funds, and sometimes even individual stocks.
   - Only invest in high-risk assets if you are far from retirement, gradually shifting to more conservative investments as you approach your retirement age.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, your tax implications will vary when you withdraw.
   - Take advantage of the tax benefits by maxing out contributions in an IRA, especially if you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement than it is now (Roth IRA).
   - Diversify your investments within the IRA by using a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use this for money that you may need sooner or for investment flexibility.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs, which can minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding certain assets like municipal bonds that may offer tax advantages.

### General Strategy:
- Start by maxing your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer matches. Next, focus on your IRA contributions for additional tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Finally, consider investing any remaining cash in your taxable accounts, focusing on assets that are tax-efficient.

### Final Note:
Regularly review your portfolio to adjust as necessary when your life circumstances or market conditions change. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
