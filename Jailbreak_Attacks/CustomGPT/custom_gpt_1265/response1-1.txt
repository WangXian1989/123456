The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are a few general tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) plan offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferral, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments for a profit. They can offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Distribute your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and consider the tax efficiency of each account type. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) might be better in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor the performance of your accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consider Future Needs**: If you have short-term goals, you may want to keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts, while long-term goals can be pursued in tax-advantaged accounts.

It's usually beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice specifically to your situation.
