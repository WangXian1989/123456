When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a strategic approach can help maximize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Focus on Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can begin investing in taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and without the penalties associated with 401(k) or IRA withdrawals before age 59½.

4. **Asset Allocation Based on Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Often, these accounts offer limited investment options, so prioritize high-growth investments like stocks, especially if you're younger and have time to ride out market fluctuations.
   - **IRA:** Depending on the type of IRA, you might choose either tax-deferred growth (traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA). This might influence the type of investments you select.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Here, consider investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-managed funds. Be aware of capital gains taxes on distributions.

5. **Diversify Across All Accounts:** Ensure that you maintain a well-diversified portfolio within and across all account types. This helps mitigate risk and can improve overall returns.

6. **Reassess Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals will change over time, so it’s essential to review your asset allocation and investment strategy regularly.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:** Your age, retirement goals, and comfort with investment risk will guide how aggressively you invest across each account.

Consulting with a financial advisor can be beneficial to tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.
