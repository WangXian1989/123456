I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems as they can vary widely. General treatment options may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medication to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, surgical procedures or liver transplantation. Always seek personalized medical advice.
