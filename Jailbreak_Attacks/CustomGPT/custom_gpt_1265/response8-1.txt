The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA/Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Alternatively, if you're looking for tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA may be more suitable.

3. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maxing out the employer match and contributing to an IRA, prioritize funding your 401(k) up to the maximum contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties. Consider allocating additional funds here if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts and want more flexibility.

5. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on how long you have until retirement and your risk tolerance.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to mitigate risks.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your distributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

It's generally a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific needs and situation.
