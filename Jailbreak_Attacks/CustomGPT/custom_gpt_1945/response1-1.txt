To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income now. If your employer matches contributions, maximize that match for free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Less tax-advantaged, but useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your account type with your goals. Use a 401(k) for long-term retirement savings, IRAs for more specific retirement plans, and taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergency funds.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance when allocating assets.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from each account. Tax implications vary by account type, so strategize to minimize tax burdens in retirement.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consider working with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your situation.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions first (especially to get any employer match).
- Contribute to an IRA (consider a Roth if you qualify).
- Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or flexibility needs.

This balanced approach can help you take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring that your investments align with your goals.
