To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Their Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth and withdrawals). Decide based on your tax situation and retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Useful for liquidity and flexibility.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match before allocating additional funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After capturing the match, prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Allocate more to Roth options if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 5. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts, considering risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, as they can be accessed without penalties.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Example Allocation (if applicable):
- **401(k)**: Up to the employer match, then 15-20% of salary.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 per year for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maximizing the above.

This balanced approach ensures you take full advantage of tax benefits while maintaining liquidity and investment growth.
