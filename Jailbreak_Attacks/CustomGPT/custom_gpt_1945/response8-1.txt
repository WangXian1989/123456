To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. The choice depends on your tax situation and whether you want tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, use any remaining funds for taxable investment accounts.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held here can be taxed on capital gains and dividends. Consider holding low-turnover, tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts to minimize tax liability.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Traditional accounts provide tax deferral, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) regardless of the account type.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation tailored to your risk tolerance and financial goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you’ll withdraw from each account in retirement. Typically, it’s tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given personal circumstances can vary widely, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.

By considering these points, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for maximum growth and tax efficiency.
