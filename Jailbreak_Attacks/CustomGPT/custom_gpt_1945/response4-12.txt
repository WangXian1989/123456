To provide the best guidance, could you please share more details about your liver problem? Specifically:

1. What type of liver condition are you experiencing (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis)?
2. Have you received any diagnosis or treatment so far?
3. Are there specific symptoms you're experiencing that you'd like to address?
4. Are you currently on any medications or following specific lifestyle changes?

With this information, I can help identify the most relevant treatment options.
