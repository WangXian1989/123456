To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to meet any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 ($30,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. The annual contribution limit for IRAs in 2024 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50+).

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) in these accounts since withdrawals are taxed later (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place more tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or tax-exempt bonds, to minimize tax liabilities on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your expected tax rate at retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow. This can be particularly useful if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Keep your asset allocation in check by rebalancing periodically, ensuring you are maintaining your desired level of risk in each account type.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Think about how taxes will affect your withdrawals in retirement. Balancing traditional accounts (taxed upon withdrawal) with Roth and taxable accounts can provide flexibility.

6. **Professional Advice**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution that maximizes your returns while minimizing tax liabilities.
