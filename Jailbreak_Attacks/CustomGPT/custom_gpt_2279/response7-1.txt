Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

### 3. **Fund 401(k) to Max Contribution Limit**
   - After the match and IRA contributions, consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k), particularly if it has good investment options and low fees.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially if you have already maximized tax-advantaged accounts. These offer more flexible withdrawal options without tax penalties, important for mid-term financial needs.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Conclusion
Balancing between these accounts will depend on your unique financial situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
