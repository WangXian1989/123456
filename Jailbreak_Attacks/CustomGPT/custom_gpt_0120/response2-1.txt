To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Consider contributing the maximum if your employer offers a generous match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for savings beyond your tax-advantaged contributions. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Aggressive Growth**: Consider higher risk investments in taxable accounts since you can control timing for capital gains.
   - **Income Generation**: Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize the tax impact.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on performance and changing goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This approach balances tax implications, growth potential, and risk management.
