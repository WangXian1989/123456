When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50+).

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Ideal for pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. It also often includes employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Choose a traditional IRA for tax deductions upfront or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term holdings are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your Roth IRA or taxable accounts, benefiting from tax-free growth.
   - Place bonds and income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you maintain enough cash flow in taxable accounts for short-term needs, while allowing your retirement accounts to grow over the long term.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your allocation based on your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance, ensuring a balanced portfolio across all accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your strategy to adapt to changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your personal situation.
