To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum contribution limit if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. They are more flexible but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Reassessment**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
