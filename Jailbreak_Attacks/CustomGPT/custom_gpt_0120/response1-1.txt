Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. This can provide tax benefits (traditional vs. Roth).
   - **Health Savings Account (HSA)**: If applicable, this can also be a powerful tax-advantaged account.

3. **Tax Strategy**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds), or tax-efficient funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider the order of withdrawals later in retirement. Typically, it's advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary, especially as you approach retirement.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
