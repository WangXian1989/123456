Distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions here next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.
   - **401(k)**: If you have additional funds available, contribute further to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may have lower tax implications, like index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks typically go in accounts with a longer time frame (like IRAs), while bonds may be more suitable for shorter-term or taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your situation can also provide personalized guidance.
