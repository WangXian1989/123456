To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full match if available.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth: This account allows for tax-free growth until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing contributions here for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - In a Traditional IRA, you'll get a tax deduction now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize taxes on gains.

### General Advice:
- **Diversify** across asset classes and types of accounts to balance risk and reward.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more toward growth in taxable accounts, while those nearing retirement may prioritize stability in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
