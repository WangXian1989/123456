Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Higher Income Years:** Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income.
   - **Lower Income Years:** Consider Roth contributions if you expect your tax bracket to increase in the future.

### 3. **Maintain Liquidity:**
   - Allocate funds to a taxable account for emergencies or short-term goals since these funds are more accessible without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing goals.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - When withdrawing, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your income until you max out the employer match.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Up to the contribution limit ($6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Account:** Remaining funds for other investments, prioritizing liquid assets.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your strategy to your unique situation, considering long-term goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
