To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **401(k):** Maximize contributions up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money. These contributions reduce your taxable income.
- **IRA:** If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. Investment Timing
- **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on higher-risk, higher-return investments in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
- **Initial Withdrawals:** Use taxable accounts for short-term needs since penalties and taxes on early withdrawals from retirement accounts can be high.

### 3. Diversification
- **Asset Allocation:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. Contribution Limits
- **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA each year to take full advantage of tax protections.

### Summary
- Start with 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- Max out Roth IRA contributions if eligible.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and to take advantage of long-term capital gains rates.

Review your strategy annually to adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.
