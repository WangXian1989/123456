To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for assets that generate little to no income (like growth stocks), as they are taxed at lower capital gains rates.
   - Hold income-generating investments (like bonds and dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and reward. 

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to meet your financial goals.

5. **Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your short-term and long-term financial goals, adjusting the risk level as necessary.

6. **Take Advantage of Tax Loss Harvesting**:
   - In taxable accounts, sell investments that are down to offset gains elsewhere.

Each individual's financial situation is unique. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights.
