Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Max out contributions, especially up to your employerâ€™s match to take advantage of free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions lower your taxable income; consider contributing the maximum allowed.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose traditional if you want tax deductions now. Roth is better for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay within annual limits and use this account to diversify your investments.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or emergencies, as they offer more liquidity.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Prioritize an emergency fund before investing.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, higher-risk investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations yearly to maintain your targeted asset mix.

### Tips:
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
- Consider your time horizon and retirement goals when allocating funds.
