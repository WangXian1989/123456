Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you still have funds to invest, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional savings to invest in taxable accounts. These are more flexible but may come with capital gains taxes. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across these accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your contributions and adjust based on changes in income, retirement goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
