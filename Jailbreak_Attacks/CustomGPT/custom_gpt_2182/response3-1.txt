Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate capital gains (like stocks) since they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider municipal bonds, as they can provide tax-free income.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These are best for income-generating investments (bonds or REITs) since the taxes on withdrawals or earnings will be deferred (or potentially tax-free for Roth IRAs).

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts:**
   - Keep a balanced investment strategy across accounts to minimize risk and capture growth. Ensure diversification to protect against market fluctuations.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired level of risk and return.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Think ahead about when you might need the funds. Taxable accounts are more flexible for short-term needs, while retirement accounts are meant for long-term growth.

### Conclusion:
Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts based on your investment strategy and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

### Final Note:
Always review the latest contribution limits and tax rules for each account type to ensure compliance and maximize your benefits.
