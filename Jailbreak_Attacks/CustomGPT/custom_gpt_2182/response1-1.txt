Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits:** Take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Tax Flexibility:** Consider a Traditional IRA for pre-tax contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRAs are great if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.
   - **Diversification:** Use IRAs to invest in assets not available in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Management:** Be mindful of capital gains tax; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Max Out Employee Match:** Contribute to your 401(k) to get any employer matching.
2. **Contribute to IRA:** Depending on your income, consider maxing out an IRA for additional tax advantages.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve hit the caps on 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider funding taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Consider Your Goals:
- **Retirement Timeline:** The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you might want to get.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your asset allocation based on how much risk you’re comfortable taking.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
