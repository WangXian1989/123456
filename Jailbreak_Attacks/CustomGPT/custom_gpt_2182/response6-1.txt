To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Be mindful of withdrawal taxes later.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, tax treatment varies. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Use these for investments you'll need to access before retirement age.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Ensure you’re contributing enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for tax advantages.
   - **Utilize taxable accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to taxable for liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance across all accounts, not just within individual accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk while aiming for growth.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly check the performance of your investments in all accounts to ensure they align with your goals.
   - **Rebalance Portfolio**: Adjust allocations annually or after significant market moves to maintain your desired risk level.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
