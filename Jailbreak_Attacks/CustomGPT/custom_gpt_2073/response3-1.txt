The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment options available in each account. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Assess which tax structure benefits you more based on your current and expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed annually, but long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Assess Your Investment Options**: 401(k) plans often have limited investment choices. If you can invest in a broader range of assets through an IRA or a taxable account, you might prefer funding these accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and account types to balance potential returns with risks.

5. **Emergency Funds**: Prioritize having an emergency fund separate from these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might prioritize Roth accounts for long-term growth, while those closer to retirement may prefer traditional accounts to lessen tax burdens in their earning years.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances.
