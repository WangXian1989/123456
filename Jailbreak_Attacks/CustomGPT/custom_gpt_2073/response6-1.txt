To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
- **Employer Matching Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is effectively "free money."
- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
- **Tax Benefits**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, you can either defer taxes (traditional) or withdraw tax-free in retirement (Roth).
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and consider using an IRA to take advantage of the tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Unlike tax-advantaged accounts, you can withdraw funds from a taxable account at any time without penalties.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **Optimizing Asset Allocation**
- **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, pay off any high-interest debts to avoid more significant financial losses.
- **Target Asset Allocation**:
  - **401(k)**: Max out contributions to secure employer match, then consider investing in low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
  - **IRA**: After maxing out the 401(k), focus on either traditional or Roth based on your tax situation and retirement goals.
  - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings goals and flexible investments. Prioritize tax-efficient assets.

### **General Strategy**
- Evaluate your risk tolerance and investment timeline for each account type.
- Consider diversifying across different asset classes to manage risk while seeking growth.

### Conclusion
A prudent approach balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential. Regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.
