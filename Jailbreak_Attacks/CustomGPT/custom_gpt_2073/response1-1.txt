When considering the distribution of your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors need to be taken into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term savings. A Roth IRA, in particular, allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Fund your taxable accounts after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts. Investments in taxable accounts can result in capital gains taxes on profits when you sell; therefore, consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in these accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio across all accounts. This helps to manage risk and can optimize returns.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Align the investments in each account with your overall investment strategy. For instance, you might choose to be more aggressive in your tax-advantaged accounts since you’re likely to hold these investments long-term.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so it’s essential to review your asset allocation periodically and adjust as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re uncertain about the best approach for your unique circumstances, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Each individual's situation is unique, so consider these guidelines in the context of your financial goals and needs.
