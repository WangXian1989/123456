To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum contribution limit to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for tax-deductible contributions, allocate funds towards your IRA next. Consider a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts, focus on taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, where growth isnâ€™t taxed until withdrawal, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) to minimize taxable income.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
