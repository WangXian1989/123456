Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, max out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you want tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - Use 401(k) and IRAs for long-term investments since they have penalties for early withdrawal.
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for shorter-term goals or if you might need access to funds before retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts. Consider stock funds in retirement accounts for growth and bonds in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor strategies based on your specific situation.

By strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
