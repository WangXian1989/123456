Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money!
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: If you can afford it, contribute up to the annual limit.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Depending on your tax situation, a Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to contribute to an IRA if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use these accounts for short- to medium-term goals, or if you need access to funds before retirement.
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Look for index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Maintain a mix of assets (stocks, bonds) across all accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.
- **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Higher tax brackets might benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
A personalized approach based on your specific situation can offer the best results.
