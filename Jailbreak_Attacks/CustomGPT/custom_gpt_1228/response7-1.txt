Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors related to your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income for the year.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Investment Goals**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options, but can still be a good vehicle if it has low fees.
   - **IRAs**: Usually offer a wider range of investment choices, which can be beneficial for growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for money you may need access to before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, but consider tax implications:
     - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
     - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or ETFs) might be better for taxable accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. It can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial professional can help tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your retirement and taxable accounts.
