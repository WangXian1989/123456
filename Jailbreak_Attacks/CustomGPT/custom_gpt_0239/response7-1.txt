To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider Roth or traditional. If eligible, aim to max out contributions.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid, accessible account before heavy investing.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) due to capital gains taxes on earnings.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Keep more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Place conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts where tax efficiency matters more.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

Tailor your strategy based on your income, tax situation, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
