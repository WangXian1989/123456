When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. These accounts offer tax deferrals or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize the tax burden from interest.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**: Strategically manage your contributions and withdrawals to optimize your overall tax situation over time.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
