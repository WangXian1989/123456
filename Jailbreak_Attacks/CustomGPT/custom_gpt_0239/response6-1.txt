To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth) for tax benefits and potential growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Keep short-term trading here, as it incurs higher taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments to maximize tax deferral benefits.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Invest aggressively in your 401(k) and IRA if you have a long time horizon.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep a more conservative allocation in taxable accounts for liquidity and accessibility.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk appetite, adjusting contributions as necessary.

### 5. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy specific to your financial situation and objectives.

By strategically allocating funds based on these points, you can optimize your overall investment growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
