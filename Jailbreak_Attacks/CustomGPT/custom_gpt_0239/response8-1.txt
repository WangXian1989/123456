Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re eligible, contribute to your 401(k) especially if it offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on tax advantages and income limits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Allocate a portion to your 401(k) for immediate tax benefits and potential employer matching.
   - Contribute to an IRA for its tax advantages.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once tax-advantaged accounts are funded, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility as you can withdraw funds without penalties (though you’ll pay taxes on gains).

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Higher income may push you to prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s). If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions to maintain your desired levels of risk and return.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings outside these accounts for emergencies to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while managing taxes effectively.
