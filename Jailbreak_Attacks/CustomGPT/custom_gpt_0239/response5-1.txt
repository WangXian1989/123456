Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider contributing to one of these to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Expenses:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside outside of these accounts, typically three to six monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

### 4. **Investment Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts. For instance:
     - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.
  
### 5. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age, desired lifestyle, and potential healthcare needs.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on market conditions or changes in your financial situation.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and financial objectives.
