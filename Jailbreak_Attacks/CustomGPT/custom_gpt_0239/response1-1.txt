Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategy you might consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Focus on Tax-Deferred Growth**: Since contributions are pre-tax, you can benefit from tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize this for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use these accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.
   - **Access Flexibility**: This offers liquidity without penalties for early withdrawals, useful for short-term goals.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before allocating funds to investments.
- **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment time frame when selecting investments within each account.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor the strategy to your unique situation.
