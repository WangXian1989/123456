Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize contributions here for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Lifecycle Considerations**: Adjust your contributions and investment choices based on your proximity to retirement. Younger individuals may focus on growth, while those closer to retirement may prioritize stability.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
