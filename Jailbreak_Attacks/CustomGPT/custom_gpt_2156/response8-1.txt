Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred. Prioritize funding this account, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be advantageous.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits. Try to maximize your contributions each year.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Funds can be accessed anytime without penalties, making these accounts suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes:** Keep in mind the tax implications on realized gains. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to minimize taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Allocate more funds to 401(k) and IRA accounts first, then consider taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments:** Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance.

### Rebalance Regularly:
- Reassess and adjust your allocations periodically based on your performance, life changes, or shifting goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Personalized advice based on your unique situation can further optimize your asset distribution.

Always consider your individual circumstances and consult with a financial professional for tailored advice.
