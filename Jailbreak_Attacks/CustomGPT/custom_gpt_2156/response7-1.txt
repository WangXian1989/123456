Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Consider IRAs**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks offer higher potential returns (and risks), while bonds provide stability.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Review your investments at least once a year to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit, while withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as income.

7. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on your long-term goals rather than short-term market fluctuations.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
