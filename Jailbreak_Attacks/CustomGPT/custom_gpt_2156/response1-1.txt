Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. 
   - **Traditional IRA:** Like a 401(k), these contributions can be pre-tax and may grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Prioritize this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they’re earned, making them less tax-efficient for long-term savings.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before investing heavily.

4. **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider asset allocation based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Think about how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's best to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By balancing contributions among these accounts, you can optimize both your investment growth and tax efficiency.
