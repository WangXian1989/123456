Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Fully Fund IRA:** Consider maximizing contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax diversity.

### 2. Assess Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Good for high-income years; pay taxes upon withdrawal.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Best for short-term goals and more accessible funds; dividends and capital gains are taxable in the year earned.

### 3. Diversify Investment Types
- **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth; utilize diverse investment options.
- **IRA:** Can include more flexible investment choices, such as stocks or bonds, depending on your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liability.

### 4. Regularly Review Allocation
- Rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for life changes or market fluctuations.

### Example Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match (e.g., up to 6% of salary).
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum (e.g., $6,500 per year).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining funds in a diversified index fund.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies is also advisable.
