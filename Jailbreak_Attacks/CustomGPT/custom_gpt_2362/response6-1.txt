Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions, subject to IRS limits.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Prioritize contributing to these accounts based on your tax bracket.
   
2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall financial strategy.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications when withdrawing funds, considering where withdrawals can optimize tax efficiency based on your income in retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor performance and adjust allocations as needed to maintain your desired asset mix and risk profile, particularly after market fluctuations.

### Conclusion
- Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts for tax advantages.
- Invest in taxable accounts after maximizing tax-advantaged options, focusing on tax-efficient investments.
- Regularly review and adjust your investment strategy based on changing financial situations and goals.
