To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before funding taxable accounts. For 2023, the annual contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those 50 and older) and $6,500 for an IRA ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider prioritizing this if you're in a lower tax bracket now and expect to be in a higher bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower expected turnover to minimize capital gains taxes and consider tax-efficient funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively. 

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to align with your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, considering the tax implications of each account type to minimize your overall tax burden.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
