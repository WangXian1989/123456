Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a generalized approach:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Maximize employer match if available—contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the IRS limit if you're able.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
   - If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, while withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be better for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for short-term goals or as emergency savings, since funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing aggressively.
- **Diversification:** Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance.
- **Tax Impact:** Monitor the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type, especially in retirement.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
