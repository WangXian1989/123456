To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if there's a match.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute up to the limit; this can provide tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; it offers tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds you may need before retirement or for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Hold Bonds and Real Estate in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: These generally have higher tax burdens when sold, making them suitable for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk and return according to your financial goals, age, and risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Future Tax Burdens**: Think about your expected tax rate in retirement when deciding between pre-tax and post-tax contributions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
