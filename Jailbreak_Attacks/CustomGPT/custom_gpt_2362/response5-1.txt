Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, income, tax situation, and investment goals. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match if your employer offers one. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. These accounts offer tax benefits and can grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short-term goals or greater flexibility.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for larger tax savings.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Summary:
1. Max out employer 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to an IRA.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional investing. 

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy specifically to your situation.
