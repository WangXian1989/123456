Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If eligible, consider a traditional or Roth IRA. This offers tax advantages, and you can decide based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - Prioritize Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to rise, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Continue Funding 401(k):**
   - After maxing the match and contributing to an IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum deductible limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds. This is useful for short-term goals or after you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax burden.

5. **Consider Risk Tolerance:**
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might lean towards stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds or conservative investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.

By strategically allocating your funds based on these principles, you can optimize your investment growth while effectively managing tax implications.
