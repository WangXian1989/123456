To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), contribute to an IRA to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, deferring taxes until withdrawal. Good for higher income brackets now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s traditional or Roth, tax treatment varies. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate low taxable income (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon in each account type.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals: Consider which accounts will offer tax efficiency depending on your withdrawal timeline.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can also be beneficial.
