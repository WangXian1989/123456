When distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts. They offer tax deferral, which is beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds you may need in the short term or for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

2. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA contributions (Roth or traditional), depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**: If you plan to withdraw funds before retirement, keep money in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to minimize risk and maximize growth potential.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset distribution.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
