Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maxing out your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

3. **Consider Taxation**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but distributions are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement based on tax implications to minimize your overall tax burden.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies that fit your unique situation.
