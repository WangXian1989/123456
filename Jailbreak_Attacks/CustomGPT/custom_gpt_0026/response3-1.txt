Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as tax considerations, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Tax advantages; Roth grows tax-free if qualified.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but flexible withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to both a Traditional and Roth IRA based on tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional investment after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that may generate dividends or interest.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. This includes stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**
   - **Younger (20s-30s):** Focus on growth (more stocks).
   - **Mid-Life (40s-50s):** Shift towards a more balanced approach.
   - **Near Retirement:** Preserve capital and reduce risk.

### 6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Annually assess your allocation and performance to ensure it aligns with your goals.

**Consulting a financial advisor** can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
