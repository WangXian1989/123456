Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if eligible, for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts primarily for long-term investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid funds in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on higher-growth or income-producing assets, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 4. **Assess Risk Tolerance**
   - Balance your investments according to your comfort with risk, adjusting stock and bond ratios across accounts.

### Summary
- Start with employer matches in your 401(k).
- Max out your Roth IRA if eligible.
- Utilize taxable accounts for liquidity and tax-efficient investments. Always consider your current and projected tax situation when making decisions.
