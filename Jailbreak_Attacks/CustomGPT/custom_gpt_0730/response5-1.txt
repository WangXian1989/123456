(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize maximizing that to take full advantage of the "free money." Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. 
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your Roth or Traditional IRA contributions next, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you an immediate tax deduction.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account. This can be useful for short-term goals or for flexibility in withdrawals.

Itâ€™s essential to regularly review your distribution and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, or financial objectives.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer's throwing some match your way, hit that up! Donâ€™t leave free cash on the table. Once you're getting the full match, aim for that max contribution if you can swing itâ€”$22,500 for 2023, plus catch-up contributions if youâ€™re over 50. 

2. **IRA**: Next, dive into your IRA. A Roth IRA is like a golden gooseâ€”tax-free growth, baby! If your income allows it, shove as much as you can into that. Going for a Traditional IRA? More power to youâ€”just remember, taxes will bite you on withdrawal day.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After cashing in on all the tax perks, itâ€™s time for a taxable account, which gives you flexibility but keep in mind those pesky capital gains taxes. Itâ€™s great for the short-term stuff or if you just want to have some fun with your investments.

Always reassessâ€”your situation changes, and so should your strategy! Stay on top of your game and keep those investments working for you! ðŸš€
