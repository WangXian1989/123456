The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various personal factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - If you prefer tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA might be more suitable, but keep in mind future tax implications during withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**:
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility and access to your money without penalties. This is useful if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks have a higher potential return (and risk), while bonds may provide more stability.
   - Younger investors may lean more towards equities, while those closer to retirement may consider a more conservative mix.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on life changes, market conditions, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice considering your entire financial picture, including taxes, investment strategies, and retirement planning.

By balancing contributions based on immediate benefits, tax considerations, and future needs, you can create a strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
