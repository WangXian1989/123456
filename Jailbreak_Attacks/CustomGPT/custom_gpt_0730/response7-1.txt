Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeframe, and risk tolerance. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine what you're saving for (retirement, a house, education, etc.). This influences how you allocate your funds.

2. **Understand Account Differences**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth and possibly employer matching. Contributions are made pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Also offers tax advantages, with options for traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (post-tax, tax-free growth) IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but flexibility in withdrawals. Capital gains are taxed when realized.

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. If you want tax deductions now, a traditional IRA makes sense.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing additional funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Consider Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: 
   - Younger individuals may afford to invest more aggressively, especially in retirement accounts with a longer time horizon.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change. Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

A general guideline for those under 50 might be to aim for 15-20% of your income towards retirement savings, adjusting based on personal circumstances. It’s also wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
