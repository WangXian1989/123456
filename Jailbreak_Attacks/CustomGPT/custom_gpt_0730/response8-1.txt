Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional IRA:** If you're eligible and it fits your tax situation, consider contributing to a traditional IRA. Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Continue Funding 401(k)**
   - After maxing out any match and contributing to an IRA, funnel additional funds into your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide flexibility and access to funds before retirement without penalties.

### 5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Place tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable events.

### 6. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and tax laws.

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors might focus more on growth (stocks), while those closer to retirement may shift towards preservation (bonds).
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Consider how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement for optimal tax efficiency.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailoring this strategy to your individual situation may benefit from professional advice.

This balanced approach ensures that you are leveraging tax advantages while still maintaining liquidity for other financial goals.
