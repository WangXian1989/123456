Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to help guide your distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Depending on income limits, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if you qualify) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high for a Roth IRA, a Traditional IRA is still a solid option, particularly if you may benefit from tax deductions now.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**:
   - After maximizing the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) if it has good investment options and low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) and IRA), consider taxable accounts for additional investing. These can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - No matter the account type, ensure your investments are diversified. This usually means a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Think about your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Remember that withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA will be taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, qualified withdrawals from a Roth account are tax-free. Consider your expected tax situation in retirement.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure you’re on track with your goals and adjust as needed based on market performance or changes in your life circumstances.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, helping you to make the most informed decisions.

This strategy balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and accessibility to your funds.
