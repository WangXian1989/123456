Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Evaluate Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Employer matches can provide additional growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any gains are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be short-term (higher rate) or long-term (lower rate).

### 2. **Define Your Time Horizon and Goals:**
   - Short-term goals may be better served by more liquid assets in taxable accounts.
   - Long-term growth can benefit from the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

### 3. **Strategic Allocation:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then maximize IRA contributions.
   - **Monthly Contributions:** Consider a systematic investment approach for all accounts, adjusting based on performance and tax implications.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** 
     - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
     - Higher dividend or interest-generating investments may be better suited for tax-deferred accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 25% of your total investments (max out to employer match).
- **IRA:** 20% (traditional or Roth based on your tax bracket).
- **Taxable Accounts:** 55%, focusing on liquidity and growth.

### 4. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals.
   - Consider tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

This balanced approach can optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities, helping you work toward achieving your financial goals effectively.
