I'm not a doctor, but it's important to speak with a healthcare professional about liver problems. They can provide the most appropriate diagnosis and treatment for your specific condition. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgical procedures. Please consult with a medical professional for guidance tailored to your situation.
