The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maxing out your contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility) and your 401(k), up to the contribution limits set by the IRS.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Contributions can be either tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth IRA). The tax treatment of withdrawals will vary based on which type of IRA you choose.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on profits when you sell. This can be advantageous for investments held for longer than one year due to lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment choices within each account are diversified and align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. You may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts that benefit from tax deferral and allocate more conservative investments to taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Over time, consider how you'll withdraw from these accounts. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. However, your individual situation may vary based on tax rates and required minimum distributions (RMDs).

In summary, create a strategy focused on maximizing growth, minimizing taxes, and aligning with your financial goals when distributing your money across these accounts.
