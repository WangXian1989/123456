Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you plan to access your funds. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great start to building your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After taking full advantage of your 401(k) match, focus on maxing out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, whereas contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: With Taxable accounts, consider the impact of capital gains taxes. Investments held for over a year are typically taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains. Therefore, it’s crucial to be strategic in how you distribute your investments across these accounts.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Diversify your investments within each account type. For example, consider holding more growth-focused investments in your tax-advantaged accounts — where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred — and more income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

5. **Your Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is still many years away, growth assets (like stocks) may be more suitable for your 401(k) and IRA, whereas, if you’re nearing retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments to protect your capital.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts. This ensures you won’t need to dip into retirement accounts prematurely, incurring penalties and taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If possible, speak to a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

Ultimately, it’s about balancing growth with accessibility and tax efficiency. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation and market conditions evolve.
