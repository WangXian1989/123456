Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits of IRAs**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, providing immediate tax benefits. This could be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for:
   - Short-term projects or goals.
   - Investments that produce lower taxed income (like qualified dividends).
   - Flexibility, as these accounts do not have early withdrawal penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If you’re many years away from retirement, a more aggressive growth strategy may work.
   - As you get closer to retirement, begin shifting towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your distribution strategy should be reviewed periodically (at least annually) and adjusted based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
