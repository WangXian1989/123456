When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to analyze your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type:
- **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, and many employers match contributions. Prioritize contributions to get any employer match.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, with options for traditional or Roth IRAs. Choose based on your current tax situation and retirement income expectations.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes. Utilize for goals outside retirement, and be mindful of tax implications.

### 2. Allocation Strategy:
- **Maximize Contributions**: 
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
  - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify based on income limits.
  
- **Evaluate Tax Efficiency**:
  - **Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds)** in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
  - **Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds)** in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

### 3. Rebalance as Needed:
- Regularly assess your asset allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk profile, adjusting contributions based on market performance and personal financial changes.

In summary, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth while considering your liquidity needs and tax implications for taxable accounts. This balanced approach helps you maximize wealth accumulation while managing risks effectively.
