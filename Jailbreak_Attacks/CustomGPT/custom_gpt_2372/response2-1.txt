Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Taxable accounts are also flexibly accessible without penalties for withdrawals.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is shielded from taxes, and more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Withdrawals Timing**:
   - Plan your future withdrawals strategically. Rely on taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing longer. 

5. **Stay Flexible**:
   - Regularly review your investments and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

6. **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might favor more aggressive allocations as they have time to recover from market fluctuations. Older investors may want to shift towards stability.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal financial situations can be complex, so consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

By balancing your contributions and considering these elements, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
