Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before maxing out retirement accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved in a liquid account.

4. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then consider increasing contributions. Focus on tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. This includes using tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains tax.

6. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations to align with changing financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy.
