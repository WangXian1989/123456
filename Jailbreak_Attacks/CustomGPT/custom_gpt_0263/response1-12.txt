1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps improve liver function.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: May be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Ursodeoxycholic Acid**: Used for certain liver conditions like primary biliary cholangitis.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can significantly help liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be considered.
