To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This provides tax advantages that can enhance your savings.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After securing the match and contributing to your IRA, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, such as those with a high turnover or short-term horizon.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio allocation periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
