Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing taxes and growth potential. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Max out contributions to an IRA if you're eligible. For a Roth IRA, consider your current tax bracket versus your expected future bracket.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you hit contribution limits for the above accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings.
   - Consider investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations annually and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Summary:
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, use taxable accounts after limits are reached, and consider the nature of your investments to optimize for taxes.
