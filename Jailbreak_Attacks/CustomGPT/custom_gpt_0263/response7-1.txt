Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you are eligible.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximum contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first because they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out contributions to retirement accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally more limited investment optionsâ€”focus on a diversified mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Often offers more flexibility in investments. Consider a broad-range index fund or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Once in retirement, have a strategy for withdrawals from each account type, considering tax implications to minimize your tax burden.

### Summary Example:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to employer match.
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Max out contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds in diversified, tax-efficient options.
