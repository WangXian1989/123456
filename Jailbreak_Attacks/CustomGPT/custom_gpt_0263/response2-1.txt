Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions, grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, but offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - Maximize employer match in your **401(k)** first. This is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider contributing to an **IRA**; Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Finally, allocate any additional savings to your **taxable accounts** for flexibility and advanced investment options.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments to minimize taxable gains.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to reduce tax liability.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Each account can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Annual Review**
   - Regularly assess your allocation and make adjustments based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, or retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 50% (max the match)
- **IRA**: 20% (Roth or Traditional based on your situation)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30% (for liquidity and short-term needs)

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances. Balancing these accounts based on your long-term goals and flexibility needs will help optimize your investment strategy.
