When considering how to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep in mind your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, similar to the 401(k), while Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment returns in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, and the tax implications can vary based on how long you hold your investments.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all the accounts you choose to ensure you are not overly exposed to any single investment.

4. **Investment Goals**: Align your asset allocation with your financial goals:
   - For long-term growth, leaning towards more stocks in tax-advantaged accounts may be beneficial.
   - For short-term needs, such as saving for a house or a major purchase, consider keeping money in less volatile investments within taxable accounts.

5. **Revisit and Rebalance**: Regularly assess your financial situation and investment performance, adjusting your allocations as needed to ensure alignment with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re uncertain, consider speaking to a professional who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and objectives.

Before making any moves, ensure you're aware of contribution limits and specific rules associated with each type of account.
