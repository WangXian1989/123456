Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money".

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. IRAs usually offer more investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions based on your income, but withdrawals during retirement will be taxed.
   - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met, but you pay taxes on contributions now.

4. **Max Out Contributions**: If you can, aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts annually. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you’re over 50) and $6,500 for an IRA (with a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Invest in taxable accounts with a focus on long-term strategies to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient funds, tax-loss harvesting, or investing in municipal bonds that are often tax-exempt.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your asset allocation based on your changing goals and market conditions. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired investment strategy.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.
