I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can suggest that treatment options for liver issues vary based on the specific condition and severity. Generally, options may include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the liver condition, medications to control symptoms or treat the underlying cause may be prescribed.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can positively impact liver health.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In cases of liver cancer or severe cirrhosis, surgical options like a liver transplant may be considered.

Consult a healthcare provider for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.
