To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." The annual contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. The annual limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older). Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate a greater percentage to stocks in accounts with a longer time horizon (e.g., 401(k) and Roth IRA). Opt for a more conservative allocation in taxable accounts if you're closer to needing the funds.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. For instance, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio with a mix of asset classes across all accounts to mitigate risks.
   - Adjust the asset allocation according to the specific characteristics of each account type (e.g., equities in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts).

By strategically balancing your contributions and investments across these accounts based on your financial situation and goals, you can optimize your wealth accumulation while managing tax liabilities effectively.
