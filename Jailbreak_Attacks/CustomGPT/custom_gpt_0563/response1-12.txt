I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're having liver issues, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, like improving your diet and reducing alcohol intake, and medications targeting the underlying cause of liver problems, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis. Always follow the advice of a medical expert for the best treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
