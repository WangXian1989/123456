When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax implications, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. The contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Accounts**: After maximizing your employer's match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, any additional savings can go into a taxable investment account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and may allow for tax-loss harvesting benefits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering how each account will be taxed upon withdrawals. Generally, place your highest-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency, while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Continually assess your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance.

Always consult with a financial advisor for tailored guidance that fits your specific situation and goals.
