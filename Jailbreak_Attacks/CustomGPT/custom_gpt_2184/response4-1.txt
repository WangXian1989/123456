To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement. If your employer matches contributions, prioritize this to maximize free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for post-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice affects your current vs. future tax liabilities.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings such as dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they are earned. 

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first if eligible.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term investments may benefit from the tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), while more accessible investments can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will access these funds for retirement. Pre-tax accounts may require careful planning to avoid penalties, while taxable accounts can offer more flexibility.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust the asset allocation in each account to ensure alignment with your overall investment strategy.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your personal financial situation, investment goals, and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your needs.
