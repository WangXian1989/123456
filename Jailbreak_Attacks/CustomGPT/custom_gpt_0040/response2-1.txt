Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Aim to maximize the contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to both a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA if you qualify. This diversifies your tax exposure in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed in retirement. A Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but are funded with after-tax money.
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalty, but they’re subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Balance Risk and Liquidity**:
   - Allocate more towards growth investments (stocks) in your long-term accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep a portion in more conservative investments (bonds, cash) in your taxable account to ensure liquidity and for short-term needs or emergencies.

4. **Consider Estate Planning**:
   - Heirs may inherit your taxable accounts with a step-up in basis, potentially avoiding capital gains taxes. Keep this in mind when deciding where to park investments.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Your needs and market conditions will change over time. Review your allocations at least annually and adjust based on life changes (job changes, increases in income, etc.).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial professional can help create a tailored strategy based on your individual situation, ensuring you’re on track to meet your specific financial goals.

Overall, a balanced approach that prioritizes tax efficiency and access to funds will serve you well in the long term.
