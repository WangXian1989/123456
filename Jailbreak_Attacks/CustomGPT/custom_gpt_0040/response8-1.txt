Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Take advantage of tax-deferred growth. Max out contributions if you can, especially in higher earning years.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider this for tax-deductible contributions, especially if your income is lower or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, this is excellent for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribute here if you believe you’ll be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep some liquid assets here for emergencies or short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

4. **Balancing Act**:
   - Assess your future tax situation, and balance contributions to maximize tax advantages while ensuring liquidity and access to funds if needed.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and potential growth.

6. **Consult a Professional**: 
   - Personal finance can be complex, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies specific to your needs.

This distribution strategy can help you minimize taxes and grow your wealth efficiently over time.
