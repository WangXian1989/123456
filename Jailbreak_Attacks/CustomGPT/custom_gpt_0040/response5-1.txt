(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you may want to maximize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts first. This might mean fully contributing to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then funding your IRA. After reaching the limits for tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. It's also important to consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance in each account.
