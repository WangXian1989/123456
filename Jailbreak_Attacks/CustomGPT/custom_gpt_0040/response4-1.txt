It's important to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice, but generally, you might consider the following strategies for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) after maximizing your 401(k) contributions, as IRAs often have more investment options and potential tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient, like stocks, which benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates. This can also serve as emergency savings or for short-term goals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type and strategize distributions based on your current and expected future tax rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within each account type are diversified across various asset classes to mitigate risk.

Always consider your long-term financial goals and consult a professional to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.
