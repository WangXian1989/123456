The best way to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax bracket, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible (traditional vs. Roth IRA will depend on your tax situation).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, as they provide tax benefits. Traditional accounts offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Be aware of the impact of capital gains tax on investments in taxable accounts and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable events.
   - Consider holding bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to mitigate tax implications.

4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**:
   - Ensure that you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, as contributions to retirement accounts are often locked until retirement.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Monitor your allocations annually and adjust as necessary based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and strategies tailored to your needs.
