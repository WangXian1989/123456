The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** (traditional): Contributions are often tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future, prioritizing a Roth can be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for short-term savings or investments. They don’t have the same tax advantages, but you can access the money without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**:
   - Keep a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to achieve diversification.

4. **Account Type Goals**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA, Roth IRA) for long-term growth.
   - Keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts that you might need access to before retirement.
   
5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. It's often wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and leave tax-free accounts for last.

6. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For example, as of 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're over 50) and $6,500 to an IRA (with a catch-up contribution of $1,000 if you're over 50).
  
7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your investments and allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure about the best strategy, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-balanced strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
