The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment options. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts because they offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).

2. **Contribute enough to get employer match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you're contributing at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider tax implications:** Evaluate the tax implications of each account type. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the money. Taxable accounts will require you to pay capital gains tax on any investment profits.

4. **Diversify investments:** Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments to manage risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles.

5. **Adjust over time:** As you approach retirement or your financial goals change, reassess your contribution strategy and asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your current situation and needs.

6. **Consult a financial advisor:** Consider working with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that takes into account your unique financial situation and goals. They can provide personalized advice based on your income, expenses, and future plans.

Remember that the order and specific percentages of contributions will vary based on individual circumstances. Stay informed and adjust your strategy as needed.
