Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Generally, contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket. Consider maxing out contributions (the limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.
  
### 3. **Assess Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) and for short-term goals where access to your funds is needed without penalties.

### 4. **Consider Tax Bracket:**
   - Invest more in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) if you're currently in a higher tax bracket. Moving funds to taxable accounts may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives, considering both equities and fixed-income securities.

### 6. **Stay Flexible:**
   - Reassess your strategy periodically, especially as your financial situation changes, or if tax laws alter the benefits of various accounts.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture and help optimize your strategies.

Consider reaching out to a professional to refine your plan based on your unique circumstances and financial goals.
