Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: After maxing out any match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: These are often tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes until withdrawal. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, and withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits, so consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash, etc.) is balanced across all accounts to reduce risk. You can adjust your investments based on the account—it may make sense to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it’s often advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, Roth accounts to allow the latter to grow tax-free for as long as possible.

5. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Periodically review your strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and the changing tax landscape.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.
